# Findings from the qualitative interviews with funders
As mentioned in the Methodology section, we conducted a series of interviews with relevant funders to understand their role in the landscape of data-related research. Four main themes and topics emerged from the interviews: 
1. Recognition of ‘data-related research’ as a field
2. Recognition that the field is fragmented
3. Collaboration and visibility of other funders
4. Data-related research in the foreseeable future. 

The sections below will explore these in further detail. 

## Is there an emerging field of data-related research?
From the interviews, there seems to be general agreement that there is an emerging but fragmented field of research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. As one participant put it, 
> “… there is a field, and I think it’s a very young field. And it’s very diffused still […]. But there is something that is akin to a field in terms of there’s research, there are merging definitions [and] there are definitely a number of elements in terms of practices that are becoming more widely used […]”. (Participant A, philanthropic funder). 

Not surprisingly, there does not yet seem to be a specific definition of the field. In fact, when we asked our interviewees to define the broad contours of the field, each person appeared to approach the question from a different perspective. This is understandable given that they each have a different background and work for organisations with different funding priorities and target areas of work. People with a background in the social sciences or those working for philanthropic funders with explicit social remits, for instance, tended to speak about the field in terms of things like data ethics, justice, privacy, bias and participation. One interviewee working in a philanthropic funder said: 
> “… lots of our work relevant to data has been about ensuring that values like justice, equity, accountability, transparency, consent, autonomy and, generally speaking, just that most [of the] needs and preferences of the most impacted populations are being centred in the way we think about data” (Participant B, philanthropic funder).

Many people’s definitions or conceptions of the field therefore seem to cover part, though not all, of what we at the ODI believe to be the landscape of data-related research. 

To better understand the perspective from which each funder was approaching the idea of data-related research, and to understand where their work overlaps with that landscape, we consulted the websites of the 13 funders we interviewed and noted down the wide range of data-related projects and focus areas.

Viewed [together](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_7l7WDhRS-fZJP6UjKZYG5mmWpkF4ePZsYaxTyR0y2g/edit#heading=h.c6k95x8aqtly), this list of funding priorities and target areas of work represents a heuristic sketch of the data-related research landscape and helps convey the diversity of topics and thematic areas included within it. We discuss the differences between the funding priorities of philanthropic funders and the UKRI research councils in a  [later section](pages/findings/qualt-interviews-with-funders.html#do-funders-aim-to-set-the-agenda-for-the-field-and-which-topics-do-they-think-will-be-important-in-the-near-future?).

## Is the field fragmented and what challenges does this present?
While there seems to be general agreement that a broad field of research about data is emerging, it appears this field is still highly fragmented and this makes it difficult to conduct the type of multidisciplinary work that is often required in this space. 

As discussed in the previous section, the specific focus areas of many funders cover part, though not all, of what we believe to be the landscape of data-related research. If this is the case, then this begs the question of why we feel it is important to consider all of these various areas of work as part of one larger data-related landscape. At the ODI, we believe that there are so many overlapping interests and areas of knowledge and expertise within the landscape that there is value in bringing the disparate parts together. Because data is important in so many social, economic and political contexts, a lot of data-related research is – or at least probably *should* be – multidisciplinary. Conducting research in one part of the landscape often requires bringing in knowledge and expertise from other parts. As long as the field remains dispersed and somewhat siloed, however, it will be difficult to acquire relevant knowledge or gather the necessary skills and expertise within one consortium, organisation or team. 

The intersection between data, artificial intelligence and society, for instance, is one area of the data-related landscape that often requires multidisciplinary skills and expertise. According to researchers at  [Social Innovation Exchange](https://data.bloomberglp.com/company/sites/2/2018/10/The-Role-of-Philanthropy.pdf): ‘Foundations all over the world are grappling with their role in the emerging field of data and artificial intelligence’ and yet, according to them, ‘few big foundations have the capacity or technical knowledge to either shape innovations or make sense of which ones to back, and when they do get involved they face complex challenges about transparency, ownership, and ethics’. 

An interviewee from a UKRI research council made a similar point about efforts to increase data sharing in the health sector:
> “It’s not just supporting one specific [type of project]. This is a huge area and involves multiple expertise, from statistics, computational science, mathematics, software engineering, data engineering, data stewardship, I mean, it’s vast, […] it’s a lot of different skills that you need to support. It’s hugely multidisciplinary […]. So on top of the discipline skills that you have to have, you have to support a variety of other skills. This is an area [where] I think […] we’re seeing more funding coming in [and] I think that we’ll see even more in the future as well.” (Participant G, UK research council).  

This interviewee’s point about an increase in funding for multidisciplinary projects related to the sharing of health data is worth exploring. They seem to be suggesting that in the future there is likely to be increased funding for the type of multidisciplinary work that is needed for much data-related research and development - at least in the health space. Some of our interviewees, however, felt that multidisciplinary projects can be challenging to fund, with some funders prioritising more established, defined disciplines and research projects that sit in one section of the data-related landscape rather than straddling numerous topics or disciplines. According to one person from a philanthropic funder:
> “[Multidisciplinarity] is vital to how the research works, how [researchers] think about things in these multidisciplinary ways. It was definitely a push in public funding to work in multidisciplinary ways. I probably don’t see that anymore from public sector funding, or as much as it was maybe five years ago. But I think universities are still trying to think like that” (Participant C, philanthropic funder).

The relationship between multidisciplinarity and funding therefore seems somewhat uncertain, with some people thinking that funding for research sitting across different fields will increase, and some thinking there has already been a decline. The impact this will have on cross-domain data-related research is also uncertain at this time.

To assess whether or not there has been an increase or a decline in data-related research funding as a whole, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the funding portfolios of two governmental funding organisations that we interviewed. Our hope was to identify whether the amount of funding they directed toward data-related research over the past decade had increased or decreased. However, as the  [quantitative findings section](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.25rz3s24c72c)  will illustrate, it has proven difficult to produce a definitive answer to this question within the scope of this work, and further research will be needed in order to investigate this question in more depth.

## How much coordination and collaboration is there between funders of data-related research?
Since the emerging field of data-related research appears to be quite fragmented, we asked our interviewees whether they had visibility of other relevant funding schemes and how much coordination and collaboration there is between funders. From the responses, it appears that in general funders do have visibility of the work and funding schemes of other organisations working in this space and there is a good degree of coordination and collaboration between funders. One interviewee from a philanthropic funder responded: “I feel we have a fairly strong network in philanthropy and more broadly in the data space. […] I probably have at least one conversation during the week where I speak with a peer at another organisation. (Participant A, philanthropic funder)”

Indeed, funders seem to value the importance of keeping track of each other’s work and coordinating efforts. As one interviewee told us, 
> “  … it cannot be done in a vacuum. And not only do we have to appreciate what it is we’re doing, we also have to appreciate we’re moving parts elsewhere to make sure we’re not replicating – that we’re aligning, […] that we’re playing our part in the border research ecosystem” (Participant H, UK research council).

When asked if a more systematic, structured way of gaining visibility of the field would be useful, participants generally said it would. For instance, one of them said that “any kind of network analysis to understand a field better, especially one that is so young and so rapidly moving, I think, is helpful” (Participant A, philanthropic funder). This same person added that this tool would be especially useful if it gave them insights about the future, rather than the past: “  what’s most interesting is: who are my peers from a funding perspective? What are my peers thinking about what they will fund *next year*, and not what they *have* funded?” (Participant A, philanthropic funder). Such a tool would not only be useful to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data-related research field, it would also help researchers and organisations that are not already part of the established data-related ecosystem enter that network, and contribute to it. 

In an effort to provide initial insights along the lines of what this person requested, the next section includes a collection of some of the topics and funding areas that our interviewees anticipated would be important in coming years. Furthermore, the network diagrams and tables in the  [quantitative findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.79b8w3umet1v) section can be used to develop a better understanding of the emerging field of data-related research.

## Do funders aim to set the agenda for the field and which topics do they think will be important in the near future?
Our interviews suggest that funders can generally be placed into two broad categories: those that aim to actively shape research in an area in order to achieve a specific goal or impact within society; and those that aim to fund quality research within a specific topic area or discipline, but are not as concerned about setting the agenda. 

Our sample size is small, but not surprisingly philanthropic funders appear to fall in the former category, while the research councils fall in the latter. For instance, when asked what the future holds for the field of data-related research, one interviewee from a philanthropic organisation with a focus on social justice mentioned that they hope to see topics such as data justice more at the centre of the data-related research agenda. They further noted that their organisation seemed to be heading in that direction: 
> “I hope that it becomes second nature to think about power in conjunction with data… I am really thinking and hoping that we are going to see a shift there that […] we’re not going to keep talking about data-driven technology without talking about how power is being distributed and or redistributed” (Participant B, philanthropic funder). 

The choices of this organisation in terms of what to fund next therefore seem to be guided by overarching, thematic, internal objectives that correspond to the types of impact they want to have on the field and the changes they want to see in the world. 

On the other hand, people from organisations that are more concerned with funding quality research than with setting the agenda for a topic or research area, seemed relatively less interested in anticipating the future of data-related research within their part of the landscape. Often, it seems, decisions on the types of research to fund next are driven by external trends that are emerging in the field rather than the result of an active role the organisation wants to have in setting the agenda of that field. One participant, for instance, noted that their own agenda is shaped through collaboration with, and awareness of, the research agendas of external research communities: “ we work closely with research communities, [and] we understand what research agendas are coming up” (Participant J, UK research council). Ultimately, it seems that it is the breadth of topics within a research area that really matters. As one participant from a research council stated in an interview, “it’s more about getting that breadth – [making sure] that the research area is covered.” (Participant D, UK research council). 

When asked about the future of data-related research and funding, participants generally mentioned: (1) that they are seeing an increase in funding and research about public engagement, transparency, and fairness, and (2) that the future of funding is highly dependent on factors such as spending reviews and financial priorities, and that makes it quite hard to anticipate the direction of the data-related research ecosystem. 

To the first point, one interviewee said “I believe we will see an increase in substantive research into approaches to algorithmic audit” (Participant L, philanthropic funder). Other interviewees mentioned the increasing interest in transparency and public engagement. For instance, 
> “I think the future will increasingly need solid public engagement around [this field] as it expands. And I think that there have been a couple of instances where the public have perceived things to be done with their data by the government […] that they were not on board with. […] And I think the pandemic has perhaps made people more aware of data. But yeah, I think that that’s becoming increasingly important and understood by people in the field. So I think public benefit and transparency are going to be really key” (Participant E, UK research council). 

Someone else from a UK research council stressed the importance of increasing people’s awareness and trust in data-driven systems, saying: 
> “… part of our remit is into public engagement, which I think actually is a low hanging fruit, we need to do more to make sure we can engage people in how their data is used and bring some acceptance towards technologies, such as artificial intelligence, because otherwise they are not gonna have an impact” (Participant I, UK research council).

In addition to public engagement activities, it seems reasonable to say that in order for data to be trustworthy and for people to subsequently trust it, there needs to be a high degree of curation of that data. About that, one participant said that “…we definitely need to fund more efforts around data curation and data quality, building on and implementing fair principles” (Participant K, UK research council).

To the second point, one participant mentioned that “there is always a difficult tension between what we think is important and what we can actually fund.” (Participant H, UK research council). Although this is something that applies to all kinds of research, it seems important to highlight how budget allocation and financial priorities play a role in setting future research agendas. Indeed, as one of our interviewees noted, that process “[…] is very much subject to spending review and […] whether there’s any kind of mandate on how we spend that money” (Participant M, UK research council). 

The next section presents the findings of our quantitative analysis. In particular, we attempt to provide answers to eight questions: 

1. How dispersed is the field of data-related research?
2. Who is funding data-related research?
3. How much funding is being directed at each of our 10 data-related keywords? 
4. Has the amount of funding changed over the past 10 years?
5. Who is conducting data-related research?
6. Where is this research published?
7. What were the top articles over the last two years?
8. What are the top keywords and topics?

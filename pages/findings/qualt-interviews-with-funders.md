# Findings from qualt interviews with funders

**See Sara’s  ** [doc with initial findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jT3E3NUNoNhf1S0WpRz1G9ZgwKwdcJ-hOSHJpKeeqxA/edit#) 
**Recap (now with quant findings)**
* [Short intro to our qualt research…]
	* Recap of the questions we set out to answer 
* Yes, there appears to be an emerging field of research and shared interest here
	* Quant assessment:
		* Increase in funding and outputs related to data?
		* But can we find someone else talking about something similar?
* It is fragmented (and why is that bad)
	* Add any more findings related to how fragmented it is?
		* Quant assessment:
			* Number of different fields of study returned in our datasets?
			* Number of different journals and academic departments?
			* What’s missing? Almost everything outside of private sector, third sector, government research… 
				* Point to important publications from those orgs and show that they aren’t reflected in our dataset
			* ~~Number of universities?~~
* Funders do communicate (and collaborate sometimes) and are aware of other funding schemes, but much of this is maintained through informal contacts, relationships
	* Quant assessment:
		* Assessing degree of collaborations
			* Number of projects that are co-funded
			* Number of other orgs included as collaborators - and where they are from? Who is missing
* Some funders see themselves as setting the agenda, others do not.
	* Research councils primarily distribute funds. 
	* Philanthropics with a social component baked in are much more willing, generally speaking, to strive to steer the agenda
		* Quant backing: Was there any funder that made a claim about what they used to fund or what they plan to fund - eg 
			* ‘We want to do more about data justice’
			* One of the research councils talking about a past funding peak, focus… 

## Recognition of “data-related research” as a field
From the interviews, there seems to be general agreement that there is an emerging but fragmented field of research around data and its impact. There seems to be no specific definition of the field, as none of the participants have given one. Generally speaking, the field seems to be understood as emerging and often under-funded; for instance, someone from the Lloyd’s Register Foundation said that “that type of space is historically a very underfunded community [and] . . . we fund mostly engineering”. Additionally, the details characterising each answer have differed from interview to interview depending on the role of the person interviewed. Indeed, people with a more technical background have defined the field around concepts such as data availability: “…essentially, we’re creating whole new fields of quantitative data research that did not exist before, because the data just wasn’t there” (participant X, ESRC - ADR UK Investment). On the contrary, people with a more social-sciences-based understanding spoke about the field in terms of accessibility, justice, and participation. Someone from Ford Foundation, for instance, said that “… lots of our work relevant to data has been about ensuring that values like justice, equity, accountability, transparency, consent, autonomy, and generally speaking, just that, that most needs and preferences of most impacted populations are being centred in the way we think about data” (participant X, Ford Foundation). Finally, again, although people agree that “a field that does research *about* data” exists, there seems to be a high degree of fragmentation and it is still rather hard to define it clearly.

## Criteria to decide what to fund - agenda setters / followers
From the interviews, it seems that the criteria to decide what to fund are more about the quality of applications (‘we fund what is of high quality’) than they are about the topics investigated. Possibly because of the fragmentation of the field, indeed, it seems that funders are happy with any research being broadly related to their area(s) of research, and specifically focus on the feasibility and quality of the application. As one participant noted, “…all of [the] proposals will be batched in the same way, and then there will be assessment criteria based on quality” (participant X, Innovate UK). 
Moreover, based on interviews, the process of deciding what to fund in terms of topics to focus on seems to be a rather informal one, with input coming from both internal and external stimuli in a non-structured manner. 
Finally, it is worth noting how a lot of the organisations and funders we have spoken to seem to be both “agenda setters” and “agenda followers”; however, it is important to make a distinction between those whose agenda is set by an overall purpose (e.g. social justice, as in the case of Ford Foundation) or if that is broadly dictated by the overarching goal of funding research (as in the case of the research councils). For future research, it may be interesting to possibly dig deeper into the relationship between public/private funding and agenda setting processes.
## Degree of collaboration and visibility of other funders in the field
Broadly speaking, there seems to be visibility of others’ work in the field and a good degree of collaboration and exchange between funders. “I probably have at least one conversation during the week where I speak with a peer at another organisation” (participant X, McGovern Foundation). However, this seems to be mainly through personal connections developed through years of working in the field. Possibly, the process relies too much on individuals and its being rather informal makes it hard for new entrants to the system due to lack of formal network and tacit knowledge of the space. Indeed, as noted by someone with a rather relevant experience in the field, “…I’ve been in philanthropy for a while now . . . I feel we have a fairly strong network in philanthropy and in the data space, specifically” (participant X, McGovern Foundation). The personal / individual / informal nature of these processes also seems to be potentially challenging in terms of the transparency of the process as well as with respect to the space left for potentially unexplored territories as a result of an established network that acts as a filter bubble.
## Data-related research in the foreseeable future
The future of data-related research seems to be tied to the question of whether or not funders have a specific purpose that goes beyond funding research. Indeed, seeing the funding process as the means to a goal rather than the goal itself seems to lead to a difference in approach in terms of intentionally setting the research agenda and looking to the future with that specific perspective. For instance, someone mentioned how they *hope* to see topics such as data justice more at the centre of the data-related research agenda, and how their organisations seem to be heading that way: “I hope that it becomes second nature to think about power in conjunction with data . . . I am really thinking and hoping that we are going to see a shift there that like, you know, we’re not going to keep talking about data driven technology without talking about how power is being distributed and or, or redistributed” (participant X, Ford Foundation). 
The choices about what to fund next are thus guided by an overarching, thematic, internal objective rather than by external influences. Moreover, those with no specific objective beyond funding and contributing research seem to have a harder time defining the future of the data-related research landscape; as one participant noted in an interview, breadth of topics is what really matters: “…it’s more about getting that breadth of sort of topic of research area covered” (participant X, ESRC - ADR UK Investment).

# What are the top articles for data-related-research in Lens (from 2020-2022)?

## INSERT: Top (10-15) articles within Lens based on amount citation count (across all of data-related research)

```yaml table
data: data/lens_articles.csv
autowidth: true
order:
  - [2, 'desc']
columns:
  - data: title
  - data: keyword
  - data: count
```

## INSERT: links to ten different Airtable views, each containing the articles in our Lens dataset that match a given keyword
* Basically a reading list of the most-cited academic articles for each keyword over the past two years (ie one view for data ethics articles, another for data justice articles) with results ranked by number of citations
* TO CHECK: can we embed an airtable into Livemark? Each reading list could have its own page

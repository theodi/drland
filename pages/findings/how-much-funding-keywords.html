<meta name="description" content="The second question this project wanted to answer was ‘how much funding is being directed at each of the 10 keywords from the ODI’s  [Data 2020](https://theodi.org/article/data-2020/)  project?’. Here we don’t focus on funders, but rather on the 10 keywords which were used as search terms for the initial discovery of the three datasets. Again, to answer this question we use data from 360Giving and Gateway to Research, as the Lens does not have the relevant financial data. As discussed in the methods section, for the sake of simplicity, we are defining ‘data-related research’ as a cluster of ten keywords:">

<h1>How much funding is being directed at each of the 10 keywords from ‘Data 2020’?</h1>
<p>The second question this project wanted to answer was ‘how much funding is being directed at each of the 10 keywords from the ODI’s  <a href="https://theodi.org/article/data-2020/">Data 2020</a>  project?’. Here we don’t focus on funders, but rather on the 10 keywords which were used as search terms for the initial discovery of the three datasets. Again, to answer this question we use data from 360Giving and Gateway to Research, as the Lens does not have the relevant financial data. As discussed in the methods section, for the sake of simplicity, we are defining ‘data-related research’ as a cluster of ten keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data ethics</li>
<li>Data sharing</li>
<li>Misinformation</li>
<li>Data infrastructure</li>
<li>Digital economy</li>
<li>Value of data</li>
<li>Data rights</li>
<li>Data literacy</li>
<li>Digital trade</li>
<li>Automated decision making</li>
</ul>
<h3>Total amount of funding for each keyword in 360Giving (2012–2021)</h3>

<p>Looking at the amount of funding each of our 10 keywords received, ‘Data Sharing’ is clearly the most popular, receiving 75% of the funding in the dataset, and accounting for two thirds of the grants. This is perhaps unsurprising given the broad nature of the keyword in comparison to some of the others. ‘Automated decision making’, ‘digital trade’ and ‘data infrastructure’ did not feature in the 360Giving dataset. On average, projects looking at the ‘value of data’ and ‘digital economy’ received higher value grants than any other keywords except ‘data sharing’. This appears to be a result of a number of high value projects from the Cabinet Office.</p>

<p><em>This project was listed in Gateway to Research as having £0 in the funding amount.</em></p>
<p>Within Gateway to Research we see a slightly different story. While the largest number of projects funded in the Gateway to Research dataset were around topics of ‘Data sharing’, projects on the topic of ‘digital economy’ received nearly double the funding in total. ‘Data infrastructure’ is also well funded here, thanks to significant funding from the Economic and Social Research Council. On the other side, ‘Data literacy’ did not receive any funding, and ‘data rights’, ‘value of data’, ‘automated decision making’, and ‘data ethics’ received very little. There was one project under ‘digital trade’ but it was listed as having £0 funding – which we take to be a limit or error in the Gateway to Research data. Lastly, it is worth noting again that a decision was made to remove projects related to misinformation due to unreliable search results. </p>

          'text': "# Introduction Over the past few decades, data has gained increasing importance and relevance in seemingly all social, economic and political contexts. From social relations and communications to retail operations and public administration and governance, digital technologies and automated systems have been embedded in the workings of many societies; the amount of data collected about people as they move through those societies has grown at a startling pace. As a result, research about data, its value, management, uses and impacts \u2013 what we call \u2018data-related research\u2019 \u2013 is being conducted in a wide range of areas, sometimes in unexpected places and ways. As well as inside academia in fields with an obvious interest in data, like computer science, data studies and the philosophy of science, research is also taking place in less-obvious fields like psychology, art, agriculture and literature. Research is also being conducted outside academia in the private, public and third sectors, in the media, in consultancies, in community organisations and across industry. And yet, despite the widespread importance of data in so many diverse parts of life \u2013 or perhaps *because* of its widespread importance \u2013 it is extremely difficult to have a comprehensive view of all the available research, writing and communication about data. It seems that since data is everywhere, research about data can be potentially everywhere as well. The fragmented and dispersed nature of this emerging research field creates a number of challenges. For researchers, it can be difficult to identify relevant research and findings in adjacent areas of enquiry. This can make it difficult to build on previous work, collaborate on shared interests, or coordinate to avoid duplicated effort. For the potential users of this research, it can be difficult to locate the findings, insights and evidence that are relevant to their circumstances and needs. For funders and supporters of data-related research, it can be difficult to spot peaks and troughs of funding, identify under-examined areas or coordinate with others to produce the greatest impact. To help provide visibility of this field of research, trace developments, and link funding, research and impact, we conducted a nine-month-long mixed-methods research project. We drew on methodologies such as landscape reviews, [\u2018research on research\u2019](https://diigo.com/0nr6jg) , scientometric analysis and [bibliometric analysis](https://diigo.com/0nr6ek) , all of which have demonstrated their value in other fields of investigation and research such as funding for [climate change](https://www.ukcdr.org.uk/funding-landscape/uk-oda-funding-overview/) and [cancer research](https://diigo.com/0nr6fr) . These methodologies can even be used to examine the link between funding, research and impact in the past \u2013 which can help to understand the present and think strategically about the future. We believe this research will be useful for a range of audiences. * First, it will help funders to be more targeted in their funding and to identify emerging topics. * Second, it will help researchers to easily identify the overall trends of the field and collaborate with other researchers who are interested in sharing effort and expertise. * Finally, for those who use research results, this work will hopefully help them have a clear understanding of the findings and evidence being gathered across the data-related research landscape that best suits their work. The rest of the report is made up of the following sections: * The [Methodology](pages/methodology.html) section defines our research questions and describes the mixed-methods approach we used to understand the data-related landscape. * The Findings section presents the results from our qualitative and quantitative research * In the [Qualitative](XXXXX) section we review interviewees\u2019 answers about the emerging field of data-related research, how fragmented it is, and how these funders cooperate and plan for areas of future funding. * In the [Quantitative](XXXXXX) section we analyse data we gathered on how dispersed this field is, who is funding it, how much they are funding, who is receiving funding, and where they are publishing their work. * The [Discussion and future work](pages/discussion.html) section reviews our findings and our plans to continue working in this area. * We discuss [gaps in the evidence base](pages/discussion.html#gaps-in-the-evidence-base-and-how-we-will-work-to-fill-them), particularly non-academic grey literature, the need for more open research data sources, and better standardised funding information. * Lastly, we outline [questions for future research](pages/discussion.html#questions-for-further-research) , including speaking to many more people, finding more sources of data, and building discovery tools to help others better understand this field.

          'text': "# Methodology This is a mixed-methods research project that aims to combine qualitative interviews and short response surveys with quantitative data analysis. It is also \u2018research on research\u2019 or meta-research, and therefore draws on scientometric and bibliometric analysis throughout. Rather than begin by speaking to researchers or launching into a scientometric analysis of scholarly research, our approach was to speak first to funders and supporters of research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. Given the central role funders play in the research ecosystem, it seemed reasonable to investigate who and what they fund, and for what reasons. Because of the emerging and varied nature of the field of data-related research, we avoided rigidly or precisely defining what we mean by \u2018data-related research\u2019 at the start of the project. Instead, we worked from the [ground up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory) \u2013 letting the topics, methods and theoretical framings that make up the field emerge from the analysis rather than pre-defining its boundaries. We believed this would enable us to cast our eyes as wide as possible and remain open to including areas of research in our landscape that we might not have anticipated. ## Research questions The main questions we wanted to answer through this research were: * Is there an emerging field of data-related research? * If so, what topics, areas of inquiry, methods and theoretical frameworks make up that emerging field? * How connected or dispersed is that field? * What does the future look like for this field? These are broad questions that we were unlikely to answer within a single, short research project, so we also set ourselves a series of more targeted subquestions, which we have focused on answering through our qualitative and quantitative research. 1 Who is funding research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts? 1 In the UK, who are the major funders of data-related research? 2 How much funding do they direct toward data-related research? 3 Has the amount of funding directed toward data-related topics increased/ decreased over the last decade? 2 Which research organisations are being awarded funding for data-related research? 1 How much funding are they being awarded? 3 Where is research related to data being published? 1 Is it possible to connect research publications to their source of funding? 4 What were the top data-related articles published in recent years? ## Qualitative research For the qualitative strand of this project we interviewed 19 people from 13 different funding organisations \u2013 six philanthropic funders and seven UK Research and Innovation research councils. * Philanthropic funders * Wellcome * The Sloan Foundation * The Open Society Foundations * The Ford Foundation * The Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation * The Nuffield Foundation * UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) * The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) * The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) * The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) * The Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) * The Medical Research Council (MRC) * The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) * Innovate UK Before each interview we conducted desk research about each funder to better understand their core goals and mission, their governance structure and their current projects and funding priorities. The interviews were discursive and informal, but in general we asked questions such as: * Do you think there is an emerging field of research revolving around data? * If so, how connected or dispersed is that field and does that pose any challenges? * What role do you see your organisation performing within this field and how do you track impact? * How much coordination and collaboration is there between funders working in this area? * How do you decide which topics to fund and what topics do you think will be important in the coming years? ## Quantitative research Following the interviews, we set out to quantitatively analyse: who is funding data-related research; who is conducting data-related research; where is data-related research published; and what the impact of that research has been. We identified three databases that contain the information necessary to help us answer these questions. * [360Giving](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/) * A non-profit that provides a database of information about grants within the UK. Funders publish data about their grants in the [360Giving data standard](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/). 360Giving then collects these datasets and provides tools that enable users to view, analyse and download relevant grants data. * [Gateway to Research](https://gtr.ukri.org/) * A website and database developed by UKRI which aims to \u2018enable users to search and analyse information about publicly funded research\u2019. It holds data on research projects, people (researchers), organisations, publications and other research outcomes. Gateway to Research provides a web interface and also APIs to help users search and download data. In our work we focused on *projects* within the Gateway to Research database. * [Lens Scholarly Works](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/structured) * [The Lens](https://cambia.org/the-lens/) is a product from the non-profit [Cambia](https://cambia.org/). It holds large databases on patents and scholarly works and provides a detailed web interface along with APIs. In our analysis we looked at *scholarly works* from the Lens. Although we adopted a grounded approach and are keen to let the contours of the data-related landscape emerge naturally from our research, once we began our quantitative research we needed to select an initial list of keywords in order to begin searching our chosen databases for data-related funding and research. We chose to build on the 10 topics in the Open Data Institute\u2019s (ODI\u2019s) landscape review \u2018 [Data 2020](https://theodi.org/article/data-2020/) \u2019, since the 10 topics it discusses represent a useful initial sketch of the data-related landscape over recent years. We know this is not the full extent of the field and intend to expand this initial list as we conduct further research in order to add adjacent keywords and areas of study. The 10 keywords are: * Automated decision-making * Data ethics * Data infrastructure * Data literacy * Data rights * Data sharing * Digital economy * Digital trade * Misinformation * Value of data The list is a mix of: general terms such as \u2018data sharing\u2019 and \u2018misinformation\u2019; fairly specific terms with relatively high usage such as \u2018digital economy\u2019 and \u2018data ethics\u2019; and fairly new or emerging terms with potentially lower usage such as \u2018data rights\u2019 and \u2018digital trade\u2019. As will be seen, having a mixture of terms has given us insights into the types of terms and keywords that are easiest to track and analyse within this space. We focused our analysis on the years 2020\u20132022 to enable us to explore whether the topics outlined in \u2018[Data 2020](https://theodi.org/article/data-2020/)\u2019 were indeed as relevant and important as predicted. (This research is ongoing, however, and will not be discussed as part of this research report). In addition, given the short timeframe of this project, focusing on two years of funding and research helped us strike the right balance between depth and breadth. The amount of time and labour needed to clean and cull a dataset over a larger timespan was beyond the bounds of this project. To further limit the amount of time and labour required during this phase, we decided to focus on UK funders. More specifically, we exclusively analysed UK funders listed on 360Giving and UK government research councils on [Gateway to Research](https://gtr.ukri.org/). On the Lens, we used the \u2018Institution Country/Region\u2019 filter to focus our attention on articles written by people working in UK institutions. (Note: the author\u2019s institution and country code do not appear in the downloaded dataset from the Lens.) Once we had conducted a search along the parameters outlined above, we downloaded, cleaned, culled and analysed the resulting datasets. The typical process was: * Perform a search of the 10 keywords listed above using an OR statement between each term. * Download the CSV of the results. * Upload this CSV to a spreadsheet software service (Airtable links below). * Remove any duplicate items in the dataset. * If an item (that is, a grant, project or publication) was missing a description or abstract, we would search for it externally and add it to the item. * Review each item in the spreadsheet to judge whether it was data-related. If the abstract did not contain enough information, then the full text would be consulted. If the reviewer was unsure about the item, they would raise it to the team for discussion. * After labelling the datasets, create pivot tables and analysis. These steps were time consuming and required a lot of labour and concentration. This involved reading and examining thousands of project and publication descriptions. It was often very nuanced whether an item was data-related research or was research that merely mentioned data. Even the term \u2018data\u2019 makes research in this area difficult. Most research will in one way or another collect, analyse or publish \u2018data\u2019, which means a large percentage of research publications mention or include the word data. However, only some of these publications actually *engage with* data as a concept, examine its value or impacts or discuss how to manage or use it. Sifting through the mentions of data to find those that are relevant is time and labour intensive. As an estimate, we tended to label about 30 items in one hour. With 1,642 items in total, we estimate we spent over 50 person-hours labelling these datasets. The datasets come with some caveats. * 360Giving * Our dataset covers 10 years from 2012 to 2022, due to the limited number of results that were produced for the timeframe going from 2020 to 2022. * Out of an initial 118 grants, we deemed 72 grants to be data-related. * Unlike the other datasets, 360Giving has data about more than just research grants. As such, much of the filtering involved removing project-based funding. * There is a huge range of values of grants, from a few thousand pounds up to multiple millions of pounds. * The Lens * Out of an initial 1211 publications, we deemed 649 publications to be data-related. * Our search returned some results that didn\u2019t appear to include any of our search terms, and we filtered those results out manually. * Some articles in the Lens are classed as journal articles because they come from a journal, but are in fact book reviews, letters to the editor, reports on conferences, corrections, etc. * Gateway to Research * Out of an initial 142 projects, we deemed 78 projects to be data-related. * We initially included \u2018misinformation\u2019 in the keyword search, but then removed it to make the labelling more manageable since the addition of the term increased the number of search results from hundreds to thousands (possibly because Gateway to Research included results under \u201cinformation\u201d). * For 15 of the data-related projects, the funding amount field had no entry or \u00a30. Our findings are outlined below. We have also summarised our findings in a slide deck which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wl_jPZ3Uu1tGRUjECF-lWO4hrNhA7Tu85Sd5JGY_ZBs/edit#slide=id.g3b5bc81bac_1_457).",

          'text': "# How dispersed is the field of data-related research? First, we tried to identify the extent to which the field of data-related research is fragmented and dispersed. Our interviews suggested that there is indeed an emerging field of data-related research, but they also suggested that the relevant research, publications and funding are dispersed across several more established fields and areas of study. ### Network diagram based on our corpus of 587 articles in the Lens that contain our 10 data-related keywords We used [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/), a software tool for constructing and visualising bibliometric networks, to map the \u2018data-related research\u2019 field based on the Lens dataset. Using the DOIs from our dataset, VOSviewer extracted the necessary information about each publication using the OpenAlex API. The software then develops a map of circles with connecting lines to show the interconnectedness of the concepts within the datasets. Larger circles indicate more occurrences within the dataset, thicker lines between the circles mean that there are more articles which are tagged with both concepts, and the different colours are different clusters, which indicates interrelated topics. The diagram shows the rough landscape of data-related research, with data-related research spread across a range of areas of inquiry. We first created a network based on bibliographic data based on the co-occurence of concepts covered by the publications, which are based on the Microsoft Academic fields of study and have a built-in hierarchy. This clustered topics together around: * Computer science, including topics like artificial intelligence, data sharing and internet of things. * Social media and misinformation, including topics like political science, fake news and social psychology. * The Covid-19 pandemic, including topics like vaccination and virology. * Medicine, including topics like public health, health care and research ethics. * Business, including topics like knowledge management, and digital transformation * The internet, including topics like world wide web, and information retrieval. The first four fields in the above list are very distinct. They are much more interconnected than they are connected with other clusters. In comparison, the fields of business and the internet are more dispersed, and intertwined with the four other main fields. ```yaml image path: ../../assets/vosviewer-dispersed-field-1.png width: fit height: unset class: border ``` [View the interactive diagram of \u2018data-related research\u2019 field based on the Lens dataset](https://app.vosviewer.com/?json=https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jjs4_b4plgfwx1HDhgXJoGvStyhPDA7V) The diagram below is based on text data, and shows a slightly different story. Using the DOIs to pull titles and abstracts from the OpenAlex API, VOSviewer then clusters words mentioned in these sections together based on co-occurrence (meaning multiple terms appear in the same abstract or title). In this map there are four distinct clusters: * Technology and frameworks (in green) * Pandemic and misinformation (in red) * Research language (in blue) * Collaboration (in yellow) This map presents a less clear picture of the landscape of data-related research for the Lens dataset, as a result of counting co-occurrences of terms rather than looking at distinct concepts. As such, common words for abstracts, like \u2018framework\u2019 or \u2018theme\u2019 feature heavily, but don\u2019t help us to understand the field as a whole. ```yaml image path: ../../assets/vosviewer-dispersed-field-2.png width: fit height: unset class: border ``` [View the interactive diagram of \u2018data-related research\u2019 field based on text data](https://app.vosviewer.com/?json=https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1JSCO_fhBpxPNAxb0XM_MZhfrZjMKyDh5)",

          'text': "# Who is funding data-related research? The second question was: \u2018Who is funding data-related research in each of the three datasets we are using?\u2019 For this question we wanted to look at the top 10 funders based on a series of different metrics. Unfortunately, the Lens does not have suitable financial data to support answering this question, so we used 360Giving and Gateway to Research here. We look at the total amount of money that each funder had put towards data-related research, and the quantity of grants they had provided. ### Total number of grants in 360Giving (2012\u20132022) ```yaml table data: data/360giving_funders.csv autowidth: true order: - [2, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: funder - data: amount - data: grants ``` Within the 360Giving dataset, there is approximately \u00a330m of funding for data-related research across 72 grants. Wellcome is the largest funder of data-related research in the 360Giving dataset, by both value and number of the grants. Its grants make up approximately 62% of the total value of funding within the dataset. The largest grant of nearly \u00a32.5m went to the [The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health](https://www.ga4gh.org/) to support \u2018Setting the Standards for Genomics and Health-Related Data Sharing\u2019, while the smallest was just over \u00a34,200 to an unlisted individual to support the \u2018Development of Operational Guidance for Epidemics Ethics\u2019 demonstrating the breadth of support Wellcome offers to the health sector. Interestingly, the third largest funder (by value) in the dataset only provided one grant. The Geospatial Commission (via the Cabinet Office) awarded \u00a32,409,375 to the [Greater London Authority](https://www.london.gov.uk/) to pilot a national data-sharing platform on the location and condition of underground assets. Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that as a proportion of the total funding these organisations deliver which have been collected via 360Giving, our \u2018data-related research\u2019 dataset remains a very small minority. None of the funders in the table below devote more than 1% of their funding to projects in this dataset. ### Number of projects and amount of money per funder in Gateway to Research (2020\u20132022) ```yaml table data: data/gtr_funders.csv autowidth: true order: - [2, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: funder - data: amount - data: projects ``` Within the Gateway to Research dataset there were 78 grants worth \u00a386,255,21 in total. The distribution of funders differs from the 360Giving dataset in that there are two large funders Innovate UK, the UK\u2019s national innovation agency, and The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), which both support around 23 projects, with a total value of around \u00a328m. On the other end of the scale, The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), only supports two projects, with a value of \u00a3332,068. To put these total numbers in context, according to Gateway to Research data, between 2020 and 2022 these funders awarded a total of \u00a37,391,655,257 over 24,531 projects.",

The second question this project wanted to answer was \u2018how much funding is being directed at each of the 10 keywords from the ODI\u2019s [Data 2020](https://theodi.org/article/data-2020/) project?\u2019. Here we don\u2019t focus on funders, but rather on the 10 keywords which were used as search terms for the initial discovery of the three datasets. Again, to answer this question we use data from 360Giving and Gateway to Research, as the Lens does not have the relevant financial data. As discussed in the methods section, for the sake of simplicity, we are defining \u2018data-related research\u2019 as a cluster of ten keywords: * Data ethics * Data sharing * Misinformation * Data infrastructure * Digital economy * Value of data * Data rights * Data literacy * Digital trade * Automated decision making ### Total amount of funding for each keyword in 360Giving (2012\u20132021) ```yaml table data: data/360giving_keywords.csv autowidth: true order: - [2, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: keyword - data: amount - data: grants - data: average amount ``` Looking at the amount of funding each of our 10 keywords received, \u2018Data Sharing\u2019 is clearly the most popular, receiving 75% of the funding in the dataset, and accounting for two thirds of the grants. This is perhaps unsurprising given the broad nature of the keyword in comparison to some of the others. \u2018Automated decision making\u2019, \u2018digital trade\u2019 and \u2018data infrastructure\u2019 did not feature in the 360Giving dataset. On average, projects looking at the \u2018value of data\u2019 and \u2018digital economy\u2019 received higher value grants than any other keywords except \u2018data sharing\u2019. This appears to be a result of a number of high value projects from the Cabinet Office. ### Total amount of funding for each keyword in Gateway to Research (from 2020-2022) ```yaml table data: data/gtr_keywords.csv autowidth: true order: - [2, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: keyword - data: amount - data: projects ``` *This project was listed in Gateway to Research as having \u00a30 in the funding amount.* Within Gateway to Research we see a slightly different story. While the largest number of projects funded in the Gateway to Research dataset were around topics of \u2018Data sharing\u2019, projects on the topic of \u2018digital economy\u2019 received nearly double the funding in total. \u2018Data infrastructure\u2019 is also well funded here, thanks to significant funding from the Economic and Social Research Council. On the other side, \u2018Data literacy\u2019 did not receive any funding, and \u2018data rights\u2019, \u2018value of data\u2019, \u2018automated decision making\u2019, and \u2018data ethics\u2019 received very little. There was one project under \u2018digital trade\u2019 but it was listed as having \u00a30 funding \u2013 which we take to be a limit or error in the Gateway to Research data. Lastly, it is worth noting again that a decision was made to remove projects related to misinformation due to unreliable search results.",

          'text': "# Has the amount of funding for data-related research changed over the last decade? To analyse funding trends over time, we examined the funding portfolios over the last 10 years of two of the funders we interviewed during the qualitative phase of the project. We examined two government funders, ESRC and Innovate UK, as they had the most projects in Gateway to Research. We chose to focus on only two funders because we did not have time to analyse the portfolios of all the organisations we interviewed, and because some of the funders we spoke to do not publish funding data in a way that facilitates the type of analysis we wanted to conduct. Below we outline the questions we asked and our findings. ## Total funding for ESRC and Innovate UK data-related research over ten years ```yaml table data: data/gtr_esrc_iuk.csv autowidth: true order: - [2, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: funder - data: amount - data: projects ``` Using our keyword search in Gateway to Research, and then doing our labelling process, we found ESRC and Innovate UK have funded 131 data-related projects between 2012 and 2022 with \u00a3244,766,406 in funding (although 10 projects had a listed funding amount of \u00a30). To put these amounts in context, ESRC and Innovate UK from 2011 to 2022 together funded 24,530 projects with a total funding amount of \u00a37,391,655,257 (1,213 projects had no funding values). ### Breakdown of ESRC and Innovate UK funding by year We looked at whether the funding amounts and number of projects for data-related research increases within our dataset for ESRC and Innovate UK. For the funding amount, the answers seem inconclusive, although this could be down to missing funding information. However, for the number of data-related projects funded it does seem to increase somewhat over recent years, particularly with Innovate UK funding. ```yaml image path: ../../assets/esrc_iuk_funding.png width: fit height: unset class: border ``` ```yaml image path: ../../assets/esrc_iuk_projects.png width: fit height: unset class: border ``` ## Who were the main recipients of ESRC and Innovate UK funding? ### ESRC funding We can see that ESRC primarily focuses on funding universities. However, there are two exceptions with the Northern Ireland Stats Res Agency and a Behavioural Insights Team. Again, we see Gateway to Research\u2019s data limitations, with five projects having \u00a30 funding. ```yaml table data: data/esrc_fundees.csv autowidth: true order: - [1, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: fundee - data: amount - data: projects ``` ### Innovate UK funding Digital Catapult dominates the funding received from Innovate UK, with an award of \u00a375 million. However, looking at the results this seems to be funding for the centre as a whole and not for individual projects. However, much of Digital Catapult work would be data related. What\u2019s different from ESRC funded projects is that a lot of the funding goes to businesses and private limited companies. However, Glasgow and Edinburgh universities are also some of the top recipients of funding. Also there\u2019s a wider spread of funding, with grants in the tens of thousands being awarded frequently. ```yaml table data: data/iuk_fundees.csv autowidth: true order: - [1, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: fundee - data: amount - data: projects ```",

Next, we asked: \u2018who is conducting data-related research?\u2019 \u2013 in this case thinking about the organisations receiving grants or support. Here we look at both the total amount of funding received, and the total amount of projects. Again, the analysis below only utilises data from 360Giving and Gateway to Research, due to the fact that the Lens only details the authors of different reports, but not their institutions. It was decided to not delve deeper into the researchers working in this space in this project, but it remains an area for further study. ### Who are the top 10 research organisations conducting research in this area as a whole? To answer this question, we looked at data-related research as a whole \u2013 rather than at individual keywords \u2013 based on different metrics. More specifically, we are asking: * Which are the top 10 research organisations in this area by total amount of funding received? * Which are the top research organisations in this area based on the total number of projects won? #### 360Giving ```yaml table data: data/360giving_researchers.csv autowidth: true order: - [1, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: organisation - data: amount - data: grants ``` In the 360Giving data, the top funded organisations are heavily weighted towards UK-based academic institutions. The University of Oxford received the highest amount of funding, and the most projects over the last 10 years. The 10 grants to the University of Oxford come entirely from the Wellcome Trust and are all focused on health-data-related research. The remainder of the funding in the 360Giving dataset is quite evenly dispersed across a number of different institutions, including the European Bioinformatics Institute and the Greater London Authority. #### Gateway to Research ```yaml table data: data/gtr_researchers.csv autowidth: true order: - [1, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: organisation - data: amount - data: projects ``` Within the Gateway to Research dataset, the University of Edinburgh received the most funding (approximately \u00a333m) as well as the highest number of projects (seven). Of the seven grants, there is one outlier. The University received a grant from Innovate UK for a sum of approximately \u00a322m to establish the \u2018Global Open Finance Centre of Excellence in Central Scotland to safely unlock the potential of customer data as a force to improve lives\u2019. As with the 360Giving dataset, the organisations in the top 10 are dominated by UK academic institutions, with the Alan Turing Institute and the Scottish Government the only exceptions. The heavy presence of academia in these tables is perhaps unsurprising. However, the lack of civil society organisations is more telling. Other than the Alan Turing Institute, none of the other major data-focused civil society organisations feature near the top of these lists, despite all receiving substantial government and philanthropic support. This indicates one of the limitations with these datasets in answering these kinds of questions about data-related research. Producing a table of top authors by number of publications or citations would have been possible \u2013 either as a whole or for each keyword \u2013 but we decided not to because of the format of the author data in the Lens. The data on authors is a string, with each author separated by a comma. While this type of analysis would be straightforward on other software, working with such data in Google Sheets proved difficult. As such, we prioritised working on the different fields of study (which were in a similar form), rather than looking into the authors.",

To understand where the research is published, communicated and discussed we utilised the Lens dataset, which enables us to look at the type of publication, the journal and the publisher. Unfortunately 360Giving and Gateway to Research do not have relevant data to allow us to answer these questions. The Lens dataset is primarily made up of journal articles, accounting for 75% of the total. The remaining documents are mostly book chapters and conference articles. ```yaml table data: data/lens_publications.csv autowidth: true order: - [1, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: source title - data: publications - data: citations ``` *Data Sourced from The Lens* The Lens dataset contains 273 different publishers, with 48 publications missing data. However, it is worth noting that the dataset is relatively noisy. There are many single-article journals \u2013 205 of the 273 journals only accounting for single articles in the dataset. Social Science Research network is the most popular journal in this \u2018data-related\u2019 research dataset, publishing 22 articles over the last two years. The top journals are based in the US, UK and Canada, matching with the locations of historically prestigious universities. One interesting aspect of the results is the difference in citation from the publications in each journal. Despite featuring the most publications, the 22 articles in the Social Science Research Network were only cited three times in total. On the other hand, the 12 articles from the Journal of Medical Internet Research were cited 385 times. However given the discrepancy we can assume there may be some bad data in the dataset. ```yaml table data: data/lens_publishers.csv autowidth: true order: - [1, \u0027desc\u0027] columns: - data: publisher - data: publications - data: citations ``` *Data Sourced from The Lens* Regarding publishers there is a much smaller spread, with 118 different publishers across the 565 articles with 84 publications missing data. Similarly with the journal data above, the data is messy. There are several entries for different publishers, for example, there are six different entries from Elsevier each with a slightly different set of words. In the next iteration of this report, further manual cleaning of the data would help paint a clearer picture of the publishers in this dataset. Elsevier BV is the top publisher, with 49 articles published in the two years covered by this dataset. The following 10 publishers range from Springer International Publishing with 45 publications, down to SAGE Publications with 15, showing a much shorter tail to the data compared to looking at journals. Regarding citations, Springer International Publishing has a surprisingly small 34 citations for its 45 publications, while Cambridge University Press (not in the top 10) has 248 for only two publications.",

There is value in tracking government-funded academic research through systems like 360Giving, Gateway to Research and The Lens Scholarly Works and it is indeed possible to map parts of the landscape of data-related research. With further work, it should be possible to provide a more detailed overview of funding and research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. In particular, we believe that the tables and datasets produced during this research project can help people interested in data-related research topics to search for and locate relevant materials more efficiently and effectively. The tables and datasets can be filtered to highlight the articles and funding schemes that people are interested in. For instance, someone interested in data ethics would be able to: * Use the [lists of top funders](XXXXX) in order to identify relevant funding opportunities. * Use the [lists of top research organisations](XXXXX) to identify content experts and potential collaborators. * Use the [lists of the top fields of study](XXXXX) related to data ethics as a way of expanding their own list of search terms while conducting desk research and as a way of targeting relevant results when searching databases like the Lens and OpenAlex. * Use the [network diagram](XXXXX) to identify the academic disciplines where data ethics is discussed the most and to identify areas of overlap with other concepts or keywords. This will help: * **Researchers** to identify relevant research and findings in adjacent areas of enquiry, identify experts and potential collaborators, stay up to date on emerging ideas and topics, build on previous work, identify potential sources of funding and coordinate to avoid duplicated effort. * **Potential users of this research** to locate the findings, insights and evidence that are relevant to their circumstances and needs. * **Funders and supporters of data-related research** to spot peaks and troughs of funding, identify emerging ideas and technologies worth funding, spotlight under-examined topics, understand the funding focus of other funders and coordinate with others to produce the greatest impact. ## Gaps in the evidence base and how we will work to fill them It is important to note, however, that these results are based on an extremely small section of the entire landscape of data-related research, in large part because there are major gaps in the evidence base. So long as these gaps remain unfilled, it will only be possible to map parts of the data-related research landscape - a comprehensive view of the field will remain out of reach. Over the coming years, the ODI\u2019s Evidence \u0026 Foresight programme will continue mapping the emerging field of data-related research and help fill in these large gaps in the evidence base. This will involve working to convene interested people and organisations to understand the challenges better and co-develop strategies to address them. ### Non-academic \u2018grey literature\u2019 One large gap in the evidence base is related to research conducted outside of academia and published outside peer-reviewed journals or academic conferences. The systems set up to track funding and research are primarily focused on peer-reviewed academic research and do not tend to capture non-academic \u2018[grey literature](https://libguides.exeter.ac.uk/c.php?g=670055\u0026p=4756572)\u2019, for example, project reports, technical evaluations and white papers produced by third sector research institutes, government agencies, industrial firms, consultancies and the media. It also misses huge areas of non-literature research outcomes like datasets, software tools, conferences, outreach programmes, spin-outs, patents and artistic works. This is a problem because a lot of thought leadership, innovation and agenda-setting happens [outside of academia](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/02/07/by-focusing-on-outputs-rather-than-people-we-misunderstand-the-real-impact-of-research/). Focusing on government-funded academic research can lead to a distorted view of how innovative ideas are developed into impactful services and products. There are a few notable attempts to fill this gap in the evidence base and connect the academic and non-academic research worlds, such as [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/audience/researchers/) and [Overton](https://www.overton.io/) , and some databases like [Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-data/) have begun capturing reports from large think-tanks and non-governmental organisations. Expanding the types of documents captured by indexing databases should help to fill some of the gaps in the evidence base around non-academic research. Research published by non-academic sources, however, is currently much more difficult to track than academic research and potentially dwarfs the number of articles published within academia each year. Mapping this section of the data-related research landscape will not be solved by a few organisations working in relative isolation. In the coming years we intend to explore ways of working in collaboration with academic and non-academic organisations to connect these two parts of the landscape of data-related research. For instance by hosting events that seek to connect academic and non-academic researchers working on similar data-related topics. Or by convening academic and non-academic organisations to explore options for adopting and adapting the existing schemas, standards and systems used within academia. This might involve co-creating a metadata standard for reports and other non-academic research outputs, which could then lead to the creation of search and discovery tools for grey literature that are similar in function to those we have used to track academic research. ### Open research and open science Another gap that needs to be addressed is related to open research and open science. Many of the largest and best-curated databases for tracking funding and research, such as Web of Science and Scopus exist behind paywalls. Most universities and large research organisations pay for access to at least one of these databases, but for many people and smaller research organisations, these costs are prohibitive. Supporting openly accessible databases like the Lens and [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) should help make it possible for more people and organisations to conduct this type of research. OpenAlex, in particular, promises to be a useful resource for researchers. It is an \u2018index of hundreds of millions of interconnected entities across the global research system\u2019 that is free and open source. At the time of writing, the API is up and running and the web interface is scheduled for launch in April 2022. We would also like to see more paid services offering programmes like the one run by Dimensions which provides [free access to its database](https://dimensions.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/23000020558-how-can-i-get-access-to-dimensions-for-scientometric-research-) for non-commercial scientometric research projects. Unfortunately, its requirement that those granted free access must publish their results \u2018in a peer-reviewed journal, or share them at a scientific conference\u2019 once again draws an unhelpful distinction between academic and non-academic research, potentially precluding some non-academic researchers and organisations from gaining access to a valuable resource. ### Open and standardised funding information A third major gap in the evidence base is related to funding and grants information. There is only limited information about funding and grants contained within the databases that exist to track funding and research, and this is true of paid and open databases. This potentially leads to blind spots for funders and researchers and duplication of effort. The issue is not necessarily with these databases, but with the reporting of funding and grants information by funders and researchers. Government funding agencies are relatively good at publishing data about their funding portfolios, and some philanthropic funders like Wellcome publish funding data in standard formats that can be ingested into research databases like 360Giving and [OpenAire](https://explore.openaire.eu/). But on the whole, reliable funding data is difficult to come by. More widespread adoption of things like the [360Giving Data Standard](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/) by funders would help to fill in some of these gaps, as would greater commitment by researchers and research organisations to include funding details in their publications \u2013 not just in academia, but across the rest of the data-related research landscape as well. ## Questions for further research In addition to working to address the gaps in the evidence base outlined above, we will spend the next year working to answer a series of further questions that this research project has surfaced. ### The future of data-related research One question we are interested in exploring is what the future of data-related research looks like. First, we want to talk to more people to see if they agree with our assessment that there is an emerging field of data-related research. Based on our initial research, there are others who agree that there is a field emerging around data-related topics, but we want to confirm this. We will seek to do this via a combination of interviews, surveys and further scientometric and bibliometric analysis. If our research confirms that a field is indeed emerging, that raises an interesting question of whether that field should remain spread across a range of academic disciplines and areas of inquiry, or whether it would benefit from becoming a separate, new field. As we showed in the quantitative findings section, data-related research is currently being conducted in fields as diverse as mathematics, computer science, geography, biology, medicine, political science, law, media studies, economics and psychology. If the field remains an orthogonal, cross-domain topical thread then it will be imperative to ensure that research findings in those disparate areas of inquiry can be transmitted easily across the network and that people are able to connect to exchange methods, theory, advice and even peer review. In particular it would be important to ensure that people conducting data-related research within their home domain are supported with knowledge, theory and skills that are specifically relevant and necessary for exploring questions related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. On the other hand, if the field were to become a separate area of inquiry, then it would be important to ensure that those working in the field utilise as many different methods and perspectives as possible when exploring questions related to data. Indeed, one benefit of data-related research remaining as a cross-domain research topic might be that it would help ensure that the field does not pursue a narrow set of data-related topics from a few theoretical and methodological perspectives. Since data is seemingly everywhere, it may make sense to ensure that research about data is conducted everywhere by the people who understand those domains. Over the coming years our aim is to convene and collaborate with people and organisations across this emerging field in order to understand their view of the future of data-related research. ### Search and discovery tools Another question we are interested in exploring is whether it is possible to create search and discovery tools or services that would be useful to people interested in data-related topics. For instance, we hope to experiment and trial different tools which can help audiences more easily locate relevant data-related research. During our work for this project, we found that it is time consuming to sift through research outputs and funding descriptions to find those that are *about* data, its value, management, uses and impacts as opposed to merely those that mention or refer to data. Conveniently, identifying data-related research is a task that is quite suitable for natural-language processing and machine learning. Given the structured datasets and our hand-labelled datasets, it may be possible to create a machine learning classifier to identify data-related publications or projects. Considering the nuance in judging whether an output is data-related, it\u2019s unlikely any machine-learning system could ever achieve perfect accuracy, but it can certainly become *good enough*to produce relevant lists and better search results. Our [initial, quick experiment with creating this classifier](https://github.com/theodi/drland/blob/main/drland/classify_lens.py) achieved 70\u201380% accuracy when compared to our hand-labelled dataset. Over the next year we plan to build on this tool with the aim to increase the scope beyond our initial 10 data-related keywords, to run tens, even hundreds more keywords through this machine-learning system. One design question we intend to investigate is which formats are best suited to presenting these lists and results, depending on the needs of different parties. It could be an automated email newsletter, or a site with a searchable archive, or an analytics dashboard, or all of these. We intend to test this proposition with interested parties over the coming year, so please [contact us](mailto:research.team@theodi.org) if you are interested in taking part.",

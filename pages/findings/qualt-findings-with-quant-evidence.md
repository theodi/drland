# Supporting/ challenging our qualt findings with quant evidence

* In order to compare our qualt and quant findings, we analysed the funding portfolios of two of the funders we spoke to over the last [10?] years
	* We chose to examine two government funders ESRC and Innovate UK
		* Below we outline the questions we asked and the findings we uncovered… 
			* Has their funding for data-related research increased over those ten years? 
				* In total amount? 
				* Total number of projects
				* As a percentage of that funder’s total funding budget? 
				* Has their funding for a specific data-related topic increased or decreased?
			* Who were the main recipients of their funding - ie research orgs and/or individual researchers?
				* In total amount? 
				* Total number of projects
				* As a percentage of that funder’s total funding budget? 
			* ~~Where is this research being published (probably not that interesting)~~
			* What has been the impact of that research?
				* How many citations? 
				* Has this gone up overall? 
				* Has this gone up within an individual keyword topic?
			* Do the quantitative findings support or contradict anything said during the interview with that funder

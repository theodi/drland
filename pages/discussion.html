There is value in tracking government-funded academic research through systems like 360Giving, Gateway to Research and The Lens Scholarly Works and it is indeed possible to map parts of the landscape of data-related research. With further work, it should be possible to provide a more detailed overview of funding and research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts.">

<h1>Discussion and future work</h1>
<p>Although these are only initial results, we believe they demonstrate the value of this type of research. There is value in tracking government-funded academic research through systems like 360Giving, Gateway to Research and The Lens Scholarly Works and it is indeed possible to map parts of the landscape of data-related research. With further work, it should be possible to provide a more detailed overview of funding and research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. </p>
<p>In particular, we believe that the tables and datasets produced during this research project can help people interested in data-related research topics to search for and locate relevant materials more efficiently and effectively. The tables and datasets can be filtered to highlight the articles and funding schemes that people are interested in. For instance, someone interested in data ethics would be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.cw1b5vr3o9st">lists of top funders</a> in order to identify relevant funding opportunities.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.hs8cgxcjrl8k">lists of top research organisations</a> to identify content experts and potential collaborators.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.y7q8zohagazt">lists of top journals</a> related to data ethics to understand where the topic is communicated and discussed most.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.yiz3bc62u326">lists of the top fields of study</a> related to data ethics as a way of expanding their own list of search terms while conducting desk research and as a way of targeting relevant results when searching databases like the Lens and OpenAlex. </li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.7rqkshns4kd6">network diagram</a> to identify the academic disciplines where data ethics is discussed the most and to identify areas of overlap with other concepts or keywords.</li>
</ul>
<p>This will help:</p>

<li><strong>Researchers</strong> to identify relevant research and findings in adjacent areas of enquiry, identify experts and potential collaborators, stay up to date on emerging ideas and topics, build on previous work, identify potential sources of funding and coordinate to avoid duplicated effort. </li>
<li><strong>Potential users of this research</strong> to locate the findings, insights and evidence that are relevant to their circumstances and needs. </li>
<li><strong>Funders and supporters of data-related research</strong> to spot peaks and troughs of funding, identify emerging ideas and technologies worth funding, spotlight under-examined topics, understand the funding focus of other funders and coordinate with others to produce the greatest impact.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gaps in the evidence base and how we will work to fill them</h2>
<p>It is important to note, however, that these results are based on an extremely small section of the entire landscape of data-related research, in large part because there are major gaps in the evidence base. So long as these gaps remain unfilled, it will only be possible to map parts of the data-related research landscape - a comprehensive view of the field will remain out of reach. </p>
<p>Over the coming years, the ODI’s Evidence &amp; Foresight programme will continue mapping the emerging field of data-related research and help fill in these large gaps in the evidence base. This will involve working to convene interested people and organisations to understand the challenges better and co-develop strategies to address them. </p>
<h3>Non-academic ‘grey literature’</h3>
<p>One large gap in the evidence base is related to research conducted outside of academia and published outside peer-reviewed journals or academic conferences. </p>
<p>The systems set up to track funding and research are primarily focused on peer-reviewed academic research and do not tend to capture non-academic ‘<a href="https://libguides.exeter.ac.uk/c.php?g=670055&amp;p=4756572">grey literature</a>’, for example, project reports, technical evaluations and white papers produced by third sector research institutes, government agencies, industrial firms, consultancies and the media. It also misses huge areas of non-literature research outcomes like datasets, software tools, conferences, outreach programmes, spin-outs, patents and artistic works. </p>
<p>This is a problem because a lot of thought leadership, innovation and agenda-setting happens <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/02/07/by-focusing-on-outputs-rather-than-people-we-misunderstand-the-real-impact-of-research/">outside of academia</a>. Focusing on government-funded academic research can lead to a distorted view of how innovative ideas are developed into impactful services and products. </p>
<p>There are a few notable attempts to fill this gap in the evidence base and connect the academic and non-academic research worlds, such as <a href="https://www.altmetric.com/audience/researchers/">Altmetric</a> and <a href="https://www.overton.io/">Overton</a> , and some databases like <a href="https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-data/">Dimensions</a> have begun capturing reports from large think-tanks and non-governmental organisations. Expanding the types of documents captured by indexing databases should help to fill some of the gaps in the evidence base around non-academic research. </p>
<p>Research published by non-academic sources, however, is currently much more difficult to track than academic research and potentially dwarfs the number of articles published within academia each year. Mapping this section of the data-related research landscape will not be solved by a few organisations working in relative isolation. </p>
<p>In the coming years we intend to explore ways of working in collaboration with academic and non-academic organisations to connect these two parts of the landscape of data-related research. For instance by hosting events that seek to connect academic and non-academic researchers working on similar data-related topics. Or by convening academic and non-academic organisations to explore options for adopting and adapting the existing schemas, standards and systems used within academia. This might involve co-creating a metadata standard for reports and other non-academic research outputs, which could then lead to the creation of search and discovery tools for grey literature that are similar in function to those we have used to track academic research.</p>
<h3>Open research and open science</h3>
<p>Another gap that needs to be addressed is related to open research and open science. </p>
<p>Many of the largest and best-curated databases for tracking funding and research, such as Web of Science and Scopus exist behind paywalls. Most universities and large research organisations pay for access to at least one of these databases, but for many people and smaller research organisations, these costs are prohibitive. </p>
<p>Supporting openly accessible databases like the Lens and <a href="https://openalex.org/">OpenAlex</a> should help make it possible for more people and organisations to conduct this type of research. OpenAlex, in particular, promises to be a useful resource for researchers. It is an ‘index of hundreds of millions of interconnected entities across the global research system’ that is free and open source. At the time of writing, the API is up and running and the web interface is scheduled for launch in April 2022.</p>
<p>We would also like to see more paid services offering programmes like the one run by Dimensions which provides <a href="https://dimensions.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/23000020558-how-can-i-get-access-to-dimensions-for-scientometric-research-">free access to its database</a> for non-commercial scientometric research projects. Unfortunately, its requirement that those granted free access must publish their results ‘in a peer-reviewed journal, or share them at a scientific conference’ once again draws an unhelpful distinction between academic and non-academic research, potentially precluding some non-academic researchers and organisations from gaining access to a valuable resource.</p>
<h3>Open and standardised funding information</h3>
<p>A third major gap in the evidence base is related to funding and grants information. </p>
<p>There is only limited information about funding and grants contained within the databases that exist to track funding and research, and this is true of paid and open databases. This potentially leads to blind spots for funders and researchers and duplication of effort.</p>
<p>The issue is not necessarily with these databases, but with the reporting of funding and grants information by funders and researchers. Government funding agencies are relatively good at publishing data about their funding portfolios, and some philanthropic funders like Wellcome publish funding data in standard formats that can be ingested into research databases like 360Giving and <a href="https://explore.openaire.eu/">OpenAire</a>. But on the whole, reliable funding data is difficult to come by. </p>
<p>More widespread adoption of things like the <a href="https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/">360Giving Data Standard</a> by funders would help to fill in some of these gaps, as would greater commitment by researchers and research organisations to include funding details in their publications – not just in academia, but across the rest of the data-related research landscape as well.</p>
<h2>Questions for further research</h2>
<p>In addition to working to address the gaps in the evidence base outlined above, we will spend the next year working to answer a series of further questions that this research project has surfaced.</p>
<h3>The future of data-related research</h3>
<p>One question we are interested in exploring is what the future of data-related research looks like. First, we want to talk to more people to see if they agree with our assessment that there is an emerging field of data-related research. Based on our initial research, there are others who agree that there is a field emerging around data-related topics, but we want to confirm this. We will seek to do this via a combination of interviews, surveys and further scientometric and bibliometric analysis. If our research confirms that a field is indeed emerging, that raises an interesting question of whether that field should remain spread across a range of academic disciplines and areas of inquiry, or whether it would benefit from becoming a separate, new field. </p>
<p>As we showed in the quantitative findings section, data-related research is currently being conducted in fields as diverse as mathematics, computer science, geography, biology, medicine, political science, law, media studies, economics and psychology. If the field remains an orthogonal, cross-domain topical thread then it will be imperative to ensure that research findings in those disparate areas of inquiry can be transmitted easily across the network and that people are able to connect to exchange methods, theory, advice and even peer review. </p>
<p>In particular it would be important to ensure that people conducting data-related research within their home domain are supported with knowledge, theory and skills that are specifically relevant and necessary for exploring questions related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if the field were to become a separate area of inquiry, then it would be important to ensure that those working in the field utilise as many different methods and perspectives as possible when exploring questions related to data. Indeed, one benefit of data-related research remaining as a cross-domain research topic might be that it would help ensure that the field does not pursue a narrow set of data-related topics from a few theoretical and methodological perspectives. Since data is seemingly everywhere, it may make sense to ensure that research about data is conducted everywhere by the people who understand those domains. </p>
<p>Over the coming years our aim is to convene and collaborate with people and organisations across this emerging field in order to understand their view of the future of data-related research. </p>
<h3>Search and discovery tools</h3>
<p>Another question we are interested in exploring is whether it is possible to create search and discovery tools or services that would be useful to people interested in data-related topics. For instance, we hope to experiment and trial different tools which can help audiences more easily locate relevant data-related research. During our work for this project, we found that it is time consuming to sift through research outputs and funding descriptions to find those that are <em>about</em> data, its value, management, uses and impacts as opposed to merely those that mention or refer to data. Conveniently, identifying data-related research is a task that is quite suitable for natural-language processing and machine learning. Given the structured datasets and our hand-labelled datasets, it may be possible to create a machine learning classifier to identify data-related publications or projects. Considering the nuance in judging whether an output is data-related, it’s unlikely any machine-learning system could ever achieve perfect accuracy, but it can certainly become <em>good enough</em>to produce relevant lists and better search results. Our  <a href="https://github.com/theodi/drland/blob/main/drland/classify_lens.py">initial, quick experiment with creating this classifier</a>  achieved 70–80% accuracy when compared to our hand-labelled dataset. </p>
<p>Over the next year we plan to build on this tool with the aim to increase the scope beyond our initial 10 data-related keywords, to run tens, even hundreds more keywords through this machine-learning system. One design question we intend to investigate is which formats are best suited to presenting these lists and results, depending on the needs of different parties. It could be an automated email newsletter, or a site with a searchable archive, or an analytics dashboard, or all of these. </p>
<p>We intend to test this proposition with interested parties over the coming year, so please  <a href="mailto:research.team@theodi.org">contact us</a>  if you are interested in taking part.</p>

          'text': "# Introduction Over the past few decades, data has gained increasing importance and relevance in seemingly all social, economic and political contexts. From social relations and communications to retail operations and public administration and governance, digital technologies and automated systems have been embedded in the workings of many societies; the amount of data collected about people as they move through those societies has grown at a startling pace. As a result, research about data, its value, management, uses and impacts \u2013 what we call \u2018data-related research\u2019 \u2013 is being conducted in a wide range of areas, sometimes in unexpected places and ways. As well as inside academia in fields with an obvious interest in data, like computer science, data studies and the philosophy of science, research is also taking place in less-obvious fields like psychology, art, agriculture and literature. Research is also being conducted outside academia in the private, public and third sectors, in the media, in consultancies, in community organisations and across industry. And yet, despite the widespread importance of data in so many diverse parts of life \u2013 or perhaps *because* of its widespread importance \u2013 it is extremely difficult to have a comprehensive view of all the available research, writing and communication about data. It seems that since data is everywhere, research about data can be potentially everywhere as well. The fragmented and dispersed nature of this emerging research field creates a number of challenges. For researchers, it can be difficult to identify relevant research and findings in adjacent areas of enquiry. This can make it difficult to build on previous work, collaborate on shared interests, or coordinate to avoid duplicated effort. For the potential users of this research, it can be difficult to locate the findings, insights and evidence that are relevant to their circumstances and needs. For funders and supporters of data-related research, it can be difficult to spot peaks and troughs of funding, identify under-examined areas or coordinate with others to produce the greatest impact. To help provide visibility of this field of research, trace developments, and link funding, research and impact, we conducted a nine-month-long mixed-methods research project. We drew on methodologies such as landscape reviews, [\u2018research on research\u2019](https://diigo.com/0nr6jg) , scientometric analysis and [bibliometric analysis](https://diigo.com/0nr6ek) , all of which have demonstrated their value in other fields of investigation and research such as funding for [climate change](https://www.ukcdr.org.uk/funding-landscape/uk-oda-funding-overview/) and [cancer research](https://diigo.com/0nr6fr) . These methodologies can even be used to examine the link between funding, research and impact in the past \u2013 which can help to understand the present and think strategically about the future. We believe this research will be useful for a range of audiences. * First, it will help funders to be more targeted in their funding and to identify emerging topics. * Second, it will help researchers to easily identify the overall trends of the field and collaborate with other researchers who are interested in sharing effort and expertise. * Finally, for those who use research results, this work will hopefully help them have a clear understanding of the findings and evidence being gathered across the data-related research landscape that best suits their work. The rest of the report is made up of the following sections: * The [Methodology](pages/methodology.html) section defines our research questions and describes the mixed-methods approach we used to understand the data-related landscape. * The [Findings](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.bvd7vdvoe92h) section presents the results from our qualitative and quantitative research * In the [Qualitative](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.180xccwi1ht2) section we review interviewees\u2019 answers about the emerging field of data-related research, how fragmented it is, and how these funders cooperate and plan for areas of future funding. * In the [Quantitative](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.79b8w3umet1v) section we analyse data we gathered on how dispersed this field is, who is funding it, how much they are funding, who is receiving funding, and where they are publishing their work. * The [Discussion and future work](pages/discussion.html) section reviews our findings and our plans to continue working in this area. * We discuss [gaps in the evidence base](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.4655pdn24bnv) , particularly non-academic grey literature, the need for more open research data sources, and better standardised funding information. * Lastly, we outline [questions for future research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.wvjwv3vikre6) , including speaking to many more people, finding more sources of data, and building discovery tools to help others better understand this field.

          'text': "# Methodology This is a mixed-methods research project that aims to combine qualitative interviews and short response surveys with quantitative data analysis. It is also \u2018research on research\u2019 or meta-research, and therefore draws on scientometric and bibliometric analysis throughout. Rather than begin by speaking to researchers or launching into a scientometric analysis of scholarly research, our approach was to speak first to funders and supporters of research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. Given the central role funders play in the research ecosystem, it seemed reasonable to investigate who and what they fund, and for what reasons. Because of the emerging and varied nature of the field of data-related research, we avoided rigidly or precisely defining what we mean by \u2018data-related research\u2019 at the start of the project. Instead, we worked from the [ground up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grounded_theory) \u2013 letting the topics, methods and theoretical framings that make up the field emerge from the analysis rather than pre-defining its boundaries. We believed this would enable us to cast our eyes as wide as possible and remain open to including areas of research in our landscape that we might not have anticipated. ## Research questions The main questions we wanted to answer through this research were: * Is there an emerging field of data-related research? * If so, what topics, areas of inquiry, methods and theoretical frameworks make up that emerging field? * How connected or dispersed is that field? * What does the future look like for this field? These are broad questions that we were unlikely to answer within a single, short research project, so we also set ourselves a series of more targeted subquestions, which we have focused on answering through our qualitative and quantitative research. 1 Who is funding research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts? 1 In the UK, who are the major funders of data-related research? 2 How much funding do they direct toward data-related research? 3 Has the amount of funding directed toward data-related topics increased/ decreased over the last decade? 2 Which research organisations are being awarded funding for data-related research? 1 How much funding are they being awarded? 3 Where is research related to data being published? 1 Is it possible to connect research publications to their source of funding? 4 What were the top data-related articles published in recent years? ## Qualitative research For the qualitative strand of this project we interviewed 19 people from 13 different funding organisations \u2013 six philanthropic funders and seven UK Research and Innovation research councils. * Philanthropic funders * Wellcome * The Sloan Foundation * The Open Society Foundations * The Ford Foundation * The Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation * The Nuffield Foundation * UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) * The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) * The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) * The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) * The Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) * The Medical Research Council (MRC) * The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) * Innovate UK Before each interview we conducted desk research about each funder to better understand their core goals and mission, their governance structure and their current projects and funding priorities. The interviews were discursive and informal, but in general we asked questions such as: * Do you think there is an emerging field of research revolving around data? * If so, how connected or dispersed is that field and does that pose any challenges? * What role do you see your organisation performing within this field and how do you track impact? * How much coordination and collaboration is there between funders working in this area? * How do you decide which topics to fund and what topics do you think will be important in the coming years? ## Quantitative research Following the interviews, we set out to quantitatively analyse: who is funding data-related research; who is conducting data-related research; where is data-related research published; and what the impact of that research has been. We identified three databases that contain the information necessary to help us answer these questions. * [360Giving](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/) * A non-profit that provides a database of information about grants within the UK. Funders publish data about their grants in the [360Giving data standard](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/). 360Giving then collects these datasets and provides tools that enable users to view, analyse and download relevant grants data. * [Gateway to Research](https://gtr.ukri.org/) * A website and database developed by UKRI which aims to \u2018enable users to search and analyse information about publicly funded research\u2019. It holds data on research projects, people (researchers), organisations, publications and other research outcomes. Gateway to Research provides a web interface and also APIs to help users search and download data. In our work we focused on *projects* within the Gateway to Research database. * [Lens Scholarly Works](https://www.lens.org/lens/search/scholar/structured) * [The Lens](https://cambia.org/the-lens/) is a product from the non-profit [Cambia](https://cambia.org/). It holds large databases on patents and scholarly works and provides a detailed web interface along with APIs. In our analysis we looked at *scholarly works* from the Lens. Although we adopted a grounded approach and are keen to let the contours of the data-related landscape emerge naturally from our research, once we began our quantitative research we needed to select an initial list of keywords in order to begin searching our chosen databases for data-related funding and research. We chose to build on the 10 topics in the Open Data Institute\u2019s (ODI\u2019s) landscape review \u2018 [Data 2020](https://theodi.org/article/data-2020/) \u2019, since the 10 topics it discusses represent a useful initial sketch of the data-related landscape over recent years. We know this is not the full extent of the field and intend to expand this initial list as we conduct further research in order to add adjacent keywords and areas of study. The 10 keywords are: * Automated decision-making * Data ethics * Data infrastructure * Data literacy * Data rights * Data sharing * Digital economy * Digital trade * Misinformation * Value of data The list is a mix of: general terms such as \u2018data sharing\u2019 and \u2018misinformation\u2019; fairly specific terms with relatively high usage such as \u2018digital economy\u2019 and \u2018data ethics\u2019; and fairly new or emerging terms with potentially lower usage such as \u2018data rights\u2019 and \u2018digital trade\u2019. As will be seen, having a mixture of terms has given us insights into the types of terms and keywords that are easiest to track and analyse within this space. We focused our analysis on the years 2020\u20132022 to enable us to explore whether the topics outlined in \u2018[Data 2020](https://theodi.org/article/data-2020/)\u2019 were indeed as relevant and important as predicted. (This research is ongoing, however, and will not be discussed as part of this research report). In addition, given the short timeframe of this project, focusing on two years of funding and research helped us strike the right balance between depth and breadth. The amount of time and labour needed to clean and cull a dataset over a larger timespan was beyond the bounds of this project. To further limit the amount of time and labour required during this phase, we decided to focus on UK funders. More specifically, we exclusively analysed UK funders listed on 360Giving and UK government research councils on [Gateway to Research](https://gtr.ukri.org/). On the Lens, we used the \u2018Institution Country/Region\u2019 filter to focus our attention on articles written by people working in UK institutions. (Note: the author\u2019s institution and country code do not appear in the downloaded dataset from the Lens.) Once we had conducted a search along the parameters outlined above, we downloaded, cleaned, culled and analysed the resulting datasets. The typical process was: * Perform a search of the 10 keywords listed above using an OR statement between each term. * Download the CSV of the results. * Upload this CSV to a spreadsheet software service (Airtable links below). * Remove any duplicate items in the dataset. * If an item (that is, a grant, project or publication) was missing a description or abstract, we would search for it externally and add it to the item. * Review each item in the spreadsheet to judge whether it was data-related. If the abstract did not contain enough information, then the full text would be consulted. If the reviewer was unsure about the item, they would raise it to the team for discussion. * After labelling the datasets, create pivot tables and analysis. These steps were time consuming and required a lot of labour and concentration. This involved reading and examining thousands of project and publication descriptions. It was often very nuanced whether an item was data-related research or was research that merely mentioned data. Even the term \u2018data\u2019 makes research in this area difficult. Most research will in one way or another collect, analyse or publish \u2018data\u2019, which means a large percentage of research publications mention or include the word data. However, only some of these publications actually *engage with* data as a concept, examine its value or impacts or discuss how to manage or use it. Sifting through the mentions of data to find those that are relevant is time and labour intensive. As an estimate, we tended to label about 30 items in one hour. With 1,642 items in total, we estimate we spent over 50 person-hours labelling these datasets. The datasets come with some caveats. * 360Giving * Our dataset covers 10 years from 2012 to 2022, due to the limited number of results that were produced for the timeframe going from 2020 to 2022. * Out of an initial 118 grants, we deemed 72 grants to be data-related. * Unlike the other datasets, 360Giving has data about more than just research grants. As such, much of the filtering involved removing project-based funding. * There is a huge range of values of grants, from a few thousand pounds up to multiple millions of pounds. * The Lens * Out of an initial 1211 publications, we deemed 649 publications to be data-related. * Our search returned some results that didn\u2019t appear to include any of our search terms, and we filtered those results out manually. * Some articles in the Lens are classed as journal articles because they come from a journal, but are in fact book reviews, letters to the editor, reports on conferences, corrections, etc. * Gateway to Research * Out of an initial 142 projects, we deemed 78 projects to be data-related. * We initially included \u2018misinformation\u2019 in the keyword search, but then removed it to make the labelling more manageable since the addition of the term increased the number of search results from hundreds to thousands (possibly because Gateway to Research included results under \u201cinformation\u201d). * For 15 of the data-related projects, the funding amount field had no entry or \u00a30. Our findings are outlined below. We have also summarised our findings in a slide deck which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Wl_jPZ3Uu1tGRUjECF-lWO4hrNhA7Tu85Sd5JGY_ZBs/edit#slide=id.g3b5bc81bac_1_457).",

There seems to be no specific definition of the field, as none of the participants have given one. Generally speaking, the field seems to be understood as emerging and often under-funded; for instance, someone from the Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation said that \u201cthat type of space is historically a very underfunded community [and] . . . we fund mostly engineering\u201d. Additionally, the details characterising each answer have differed from interview to interview depending on the role of the person interviewed. Indeed, people with a more technical background have defined the field around concepts such as data availability: \u201c\u2026essentially, we\u2019re creating whole new fields of quantitative data research that did not exist before, because the data just wasn\u2019t there\u201d (participant X, ESRC - ADR UK Investment). On the contrary, people with a more social-sciences-based understanding spoke about the field in terms of accessibility, justice, and participation. Someone from Ford Foundation, for instance, said that \u201c\u2026 lots of our work relevant to data has been about ensuring that values like justice, equity, accountability, transparency, consent, autonomy, and generally speaking, just that, that most needs and preferences of most impacted populations are being centred in the way we think about data\u201d (participant X, Ford Foundation). Finally, again, although people agree that \u201ca field that does research *about* data\u201d exists, there seems to be a high degree of fragmentation and it is still rather hard to define it clearly. ## Recognition that the field is fragmented and the reasons why that is challenging [xxx] ## Criteria to decide what to fund - agenda setters / followers From the interviews, it seems that the criteria to decide what to fund are more about the quality of applications (\u2018we fund what is of high quality\u2019) than they are about the topics investigated. Possibly because of the fragmentation of the field, indeed, it seems that funders are happy with any research being broadly related to their area(s) of research, and specifically focus on the feasibility and quality of the application. As one participant noted, \u201c\u2026all of [the] proposals will be batched in the same way, and then there will be assessment criteria based on quality\u201d (participant X, Innovate UK). Moreover, based on interviews, the process of deciding what to fund in terms of topics to focus on seems to be a rather informal one, with input coming from both internal and external stimuli in a non-structured manner. Finally, it is worth noting how a lot of the organisations and funders we have spoken to seem to be both \u201cagenda setters\u201d and \u201cagenda followers\u201d; however, it is important to make a distinction between those whose agenda is set by an overall purpose (e.g. social justice, as in the case of Ford Foundation) or if that is broadly dictated by the overarching goal of funding research (as in the case of the research councils). For future research, it may be interesting to possibly dig deeper into the relationship between public/private funding and agenda setting processes. ## Degree of collaboration and visibility of other funders in the field Broadly speaking, there seems to be visibility of others\u2019 work in the field and a good degree of collaboration and exchange between funders. \u201cI probably have at least one conversation during the week where I speak with a peer at another organisation\u201d (participant X, McGovern Foundation). However, this seems to be mainly through personal connections developed through years of working in the field. Possibly, the process relies too much on individuals and its being rather informal makes it hard for new entrants to the system due to lack of formal network and tacit knowledge of the space. Indeed, as noted by someone with a rather relevant experience in the field, \u201c\u2026I\u2019ve been in philanthropy for a while now . . . I feel we have a fairly strong network in philanthropy and in the data space, specifically\u201d (participant X, McGovern Foundation). The personal / individual / informal nature of these processes also seems to be potentially challenging in terms of the transparency of the process as well as with respect to the space left for potentially unexplored territories as a result of an established network that acts as a filter bubble. ## Data-related research in the foreseeable future The future of data-related research seems to be tied to the question of whether or not funders have a specific purpose that goes beyond funding research. Indeed, seeing the funding process as the means to a goal rather than the goal itself seems to lead to a difference in approach in terms of intentionally setting the research agenda and looking to the future with that specific perspective. For instance, someone mentioned how they *hope* to see topics such as data justice more at the centre of the data-related research agenda, and how their organisations seem to be heading that way: \u201cI hope that it becomes second nature to think about power in conjunction with data . . . I am really thinking and hoping that we are going to see a shift there that like, you know, we\u2019re not going to keep talking about data driven technology without talking about how power is being distributed and or, or redistributed\u201d (participant X, Ford Foundation). The choices about what to fund next are thus guided by an overarching, thematic, internal objective rather than by external influences. Moreover, those with no specific objective beyond funding and contributing research seem to have a harder time defining the future of the data-related research landscape; as one participant noted in an interview, breadth of topics is what really matters: \u201c\u2026it\u2019s more about getting that breadth of sort of topic of research area covered\u201d (participant X, ESRC - ADR UK Investment).",

There is value in tracking government-funded academic research through systems like 360Giving, Gateway to Research and The Lens Scholarly Works and it is indeed possible to map parts of the landscape of data-related research. With further work, it should be possible to provide a more detailed overview of funding and research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. In particular, we believe that the tables and datasets produced during this research project can help people interested in data-related research topics to search for and locate relevant materials more efficiently and effectively. The tables and datasets can be filtered to highlight the articles and funding schemes that people are interested in. For instance, someone interested in data ethics would be able to: * Use the [lists of top funders](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.cw1b5vr3o9st) in order to identify relevant funding opportunities. * Use the [lists of top research organisations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.hs8cgxcjrl8k) to identify content experts and potential collaborators. * Use the [lists of top journals](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.y7q8zohagazt) related to data ethics to understand where the topic is communicated and discussed most. * Use the [lists of the top fields of study](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.yiz3bc62u326) related to data ethics as a way of expanding their own list of search terms while conducting desk research and as a way of targeting relevant results when searching databases like the Lens and OpenAlex. * Use the [network diagram](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16NY5Xus-yJPr9RXCXSx2Y4BxidsRoGygUm_EILzR3f4/edit#bookmark=id.7rqkshns4kd6) to identify the academic disciplines where data ethics is discussed the most and to identify areas of overlap with other concepts or keywords. This will help: * **Researchers** to identify relevant research and findings in adjacent areas of enquiry, identify experts and potential collaborators, stay up to date on emerging ideas and topics, build on previous work, identify potential sources of funding and coordinate to avoid duplicated effort. * **Potential users of this research** to locate the findings, insights and evidence that are relevant to their circumstances and needs. * **Funders and supporters of data-related research** to spot peaks and troughs of funding, identify emerging ideas and technologies worth funding, spotlight under-examined topics, understand the funding focus of other funders and coordinate with others to produce the greatest impact. ## Gaps in the evidence base and how we will work to fill them It is important to note, however, that these results are based on an extremely small section of the entire landscape of data-related research, in large part because there are major gaps in the evidence base. So long as these gaps remain unfilled, it will only be possible to map parts of the data-related research landscape - a comprehensive view of the field will remain out of reach. Over the coming years, the ODI\u2019s Evidence \u0026 Foresight programme will continue mapping the emerging field of data-related research and help fill in these large gaps in the evidence base. This will involve working to convene interested people and organisations to understand the challenges better and co-develop strategies to address them. ### Non-academic \u2018grey literature\u2019 One large gap in the evidence base is related to research conducted outside of academia and published outside peer-reviewed journals or academic conferences. The systems set up to track funding and research are primarily focused on peer-reviewed academic research and do not tend to capture non-academic \u2018[grey literature](https://libguides.exeter.ac.uk/c.php?g=670055\u0026p=4756572)\u2019, for example, project reports, technical evaluations and white papers produced by third sector research institutes, government agencies, industrial firms, consultancies and the media. It also misses huge areas of non-literature research outcomes like datasets, software tools, conferences, outreach programmes, spin-outs, patents and artistic works. This is a problem because a lot of thought leadership, innovation and agenda-setting happens [outside of academia](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2022/02/07/by-focusing-on-outputs-rather-than-people-we-misunderstand-the-real-impact-of-research/). Focusing on government-funded academic research can lead to a distorted view of how innovative ideas are developed into impactful services and products. There are a few notable attempts to fill this gap in the evidence base and connect the academic and non-academic research worlds, such as [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/audience/researchers/) and [Overton](https://www.overton.io/) , and some databases like [Dimensions](https://www.dimensions.ai/dimensions-data/) have begun capturing reports from large think-tanks and non-governmental organisations. Expanding the types of documents captured by indexing databases should help to fill some of the gaps in the evidence base around non-academic research. Research published by non-academic sources, however, is currently much more difficult to track than academic research and potentially dwarfs the number of articles published within academia each year. Mapping this section of the data-related research landscape will not be solved by a few organisations working in relative isolation. In the coming years we intend to explore ways of working in collaboration with academic and non-academic organisations to connect these two parts of the landscape of data-related research. For instance by hosting events that seek to connect academic and non-academic researchers working on similar data-related topics. Or by convening academic and non-academic organisations to explore options for adopting and adapting the existing schemas, standards and systems used within academia. This might involve co-creating a metadata standard for reports and other non-academic research outputs, which could then lead to the creation of search and discovery tools for grey literature that are similar in function to those we have used to track academic research. ### Open research and open science Another gap that needs to be addressed is related to open research and open science. Many of the largest and best-curated databases for tracking funding and research, such as Web of Science and Scopus exist behind paywalls. Most universities and large research organisations pay for access to at least one of these databases, but for many people and smaller research organisations, these costs are prohibitive. Supporting openly accessible databases like the Lens and [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) should help make it possible for more people and organisations to conduct this type of research. OpenAlex, in particular, promises to be a useful resource for researchers. It is an \u2018index of hundreds of millions of interconnected entities across the global research system\u2019 that is free and open source. At the time of writing, the API is up and running and the web interface is scheduled for launch in April 2022. We would also like to see more paid services offering programmes like the one run by Dimensions which provides [free access to its database](https://dimensions.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/23000020558-how-can-i-get-access-to-dimensions-for-scientometric-research-) for non-commercial scientometric research projects. Unfortunately, its requirement that those granted free access must publish their results \u2018in a peer-reviewed journal, or share them at a scientific conference\u2019 once again draws an unhelpful distinction between academic and non-academic research, potentially precluding some non-academic researchers and organisations from gaining access to a valuable resource. ### Open and standardised funding information A third major gap in the evidence base is related to funding and grants information. There is only limited information about funding and grants contained within the databases that exist to track funding and research, and this is true of paid and open databases. This potentially leads to blind spots for funders and researchers and duplication of effort. The issue is not necessarily with these databases, but with the reporting of funding and grants information by funders and researchers. Government funding agencies are relatively good at publishing data about their funding portfolios, and some philanthropic funders like Wellcome publish funding data in standard formats that can be ingested into research databases like 360Giving and [OpenAire](https://explore.openaire.eu/). But on the whole, reliable funding data is difficult to come by. More widespread adoption of things like the [360Giving Data Standard](https://www.threesixtygiving.org/support/standard/) by funders would help to fill in some of these gaps, as would greater commitment by researchers and research organisations to include funding details in their publications \u2013 not just in academia, but across the rest of the data-related research landscape as well. ## Questions for further research In addition to working to address the gaps in the evidence base outlined above, we will spend the next year working to answer a series of further questions that this research project has surfaced. ### The future of data-related research One question we are interested in exploring is what the future of data-related research looks like. First, we want to talk to more people to see if they agree with our assessment that there is an emerging field of data-related research. Based on our initial research, there are others who agree that there is a field emerging around data-related topics, but we want to confirm this. We will seek to do this via a combination of interviews, surveys and further scientometric and bibliometric analysis. If our research confirms that a field is indeed emerging, that raises an interesting question of whether that field should remain spread across a range of academic disciplines and areas of inquiry, or whether it would benefit from becoming a separate, new field. As we showed in the quantitative findings section, data-related research is currently being conducted in fields as diverse as mathematics, computer science, geography, biology, medicine, political science, law, media studies, economics and psychology. If the field remains an orthogonal, cross-domain topical thread then it will be imperative to ensure that research findings in those disparate areas of inquiry can be transmitted easily across the network and that people are able to connect to exchange methods, theory, advice and even peer review. In particular it would be important to ensure that people conducting data-related research within their home domain are supported with knowledge, theory and skills that are specifically relevant and necessary for exploring questions related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. On the other hand, if the field were to become a separate area of inquiry, then it would be important to ensure that those working in the field utilise as many different methods and perspectives as possible when exploring questions related to data. Indeed, one benefit of data-related research remaining as a cross-domain research topic might be that it would help ensure that the field does not pursue a narrow set of data-related topics from a few theoretical and methodological perspectives. Since data is seemingly everywhere, it may make sense to ensure that research about data is conducted everywhere by the people who understand those domains. Over the coming years our aim is to convene and collaborate with people and organisations across this emerging field in order to understand their view of the future of data-related research. ### Search and discovery tools Another question we are interested in exploring is whether it is possible to create search and discovery tools or services that would be useful to people interested in data-related topics. For instance, we hope to experiment and trial different tools which can help audiences more easily locate relevant data-related research. During our work for this project, we found that it is time consuming to sift through research outputs and funding descriptions to find those that are *about* data, its value, management, uses and impacts as opposed to merely those that mention or refer to data. Conveniently, identifying data-related research is a task that is quite suitable for natural-language processing and machine learning. Given the structured datasets and our hand-labelled datasets, it may be possible to create a machine learning classifier to identify data-related publications or projects. Considering the nuance in judging whether an output is data-related, it\u2019s unlikely any machine-learning system could ever achieve perfect accuracy, but it can certainly become *good enough*to produce relevant lists and better search results. Our [initial, quick experiment with creating this classifier](https://github.com/theodi/drland/blob/main/drland/classify_lens.py) achieved 70\u201380% accuracy when compared to our hand-labelled dataset. Over the next year we plan to build on this tool with the aim to increase the scope beyond our initial 10 data-related keywords, to run tens, even hundreds more keywords through this machine-learning system. One design question we intend to investigate is which formats are best suited to presenting these lists and results, depending on the needs of different parties. It could be an automated email newsletter, or a site with a searchable archive, or an analytics dashboard, or all of these. We intend to test this proposition with interested parties over the coming year, so please [contact us](mailto:research.team@theodi.org) if you are interested in taking part.",

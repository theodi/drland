# Qualitative findings intro

As mentioned in the Methodology section, we conducted a series of interviews with relevant funders to understand their role in the landscape of data-related research. Four main themes and topics emerged from the interviews: 
1. Recognition of ‘data-related research’ as a field
2. Recognition that the field is fragmented
3. Collaboration and visibility of other funders
4. Data-related research in the foreseeable future. 

The sections below will explore these in further detail.

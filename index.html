<meta name="description" content="From the interviews, there seems to be general agreement that there is an emerging but fragmented field of research around data and its impact. There seems to be no specific definition of the field, as none of the participants have given one. Generally speaking, the field seems to be understood as emerging and often under-funded; for instance, someone from the Lloyd's Register Foundation said that “that type of space is historically a very underfunded community [and] . . . we fund mostly engineering”. Additionally, the details characterising each answer have differed from interview to interview depending on the role of the person interviewed. Indeed, people with a more technical background have defined the field around concepts such as data availability: “...essentially, we're creating whole new fields of quantitative data research that did not exist before, because the data just wasn't there” (participant X, ESRC - ADR UK Investment). On the contrary, people with a more social-sciences-based understanding spoke about the field in terms of accessibility, justice, and participation. Someone from Ford Foundation, for instance, said that “... lots of our work relevant to data has been about ensuring that values like justice, equity, accountability, transparency, consent, autonomy, and generally speaking, just that, that most needs and preferences of most impacted populations are being centred in the way we think about data” (participant X, Ford Foundation). Finally, again, although people agree that “a field that does research *about* data” exists, there seems to be a high degree of fragmentation and it is still rather hard to define it clearly.">

<h1>Intro / What is the point/ value of this research?</h1>
<p><strong>Outlining the challenge and approach (borrowed from intro to short summary report)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Data is important and is having an impact (seemingly) everywhere.</li>
<li>
Because of this, research about data, its value, management, uses and impacts - what we call ‘data-related research’ - is being conducted nearly everywhere, sometimes in places you wouldn’t expect. <ul>
<li>Inside and outside academia (private and public sector, third sector, media, consultancy, industry - ie grey literature)</li>
<li>‘Pure and applied’ </li>
<li>Newer fields built explicitly around data like ‘critical data studies’ and older, more established fields like agriculture and [art?]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
And yet, despite the widespread importance of data in so many diverse parts of life] - or perhaps because of its widespread importance - it is extremely difficult to have a comprehensive view of all the research, writing and communication about data out there. <ul>
<li>Since data is everywhere, research about data is everywhere. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The fragmented and dispersed nature of this research field makes it difficult… <ul>
<li>… for researchers to identify relevant results in adjacent areas of enquiry, build on previous work, collaborate on shared interests, or coordinate to avoid duplicated effort. </li>
<li>… for the audience and users of this research to locate and recognise research findings, insights and evidence that are relevant to their circumstances and needs. This can lead to [silos and people re-inventing techniques which were used in other domains - but don’t know how to even find this]</li>
<li>… for funders of data-related research and for those working to encourage research in this area to [coordinate, have visibility, spot peaks and troughs, etc.]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
To help provide visibility of this field of research, trace developments and link funding, research and impact, we conducted a [9 month?] mixed-methods research project… 	* We drew on methodologies such as landscape reviews, ‘research on research’, scientometric analysis, bibliometric analysis which have demonstrated their value in other fields of investigation and research such as funding for AI and cancer research…

<h1>Approach/ methodology and overview of research question(s)</h1>
<ul>
<li>
We worked from the ground up - letting the field emerge from the analysis rather than pre-defining the boundaries of the field<ul>
<li><em>Borrow as much as possible from the launch blog post and work note, eg why we’re not trying to define the boundaries of the field (ie working from the ground up) and starting with funders (ie tracing the funding cycle)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Our research questions were…<ul>
<li>Our main research question was: What is going on in the data-related research landscape?</li>
<li>
Our secondary research questions were:<ul>
<li>
Who is funding research in this area?<ul>
<li>In the UK, who are the major funders of ‘data-related research’ - ie research about data, its value, uses and impacts?</li>
<li>How much funding do they direct toward ‘data-related research’ each year? How much in past years? How much is planned for future years?</li>
<li>What is the process for securing funding/ what are the requirements? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
What ‘data-related’ topics are being funded by these organisations? <ul>
<li>What is currently big in the world of data, tech, policy, governance, new uses of data, etc.? </li>
<li>What are going to be the next big things in data over the next one, five, ten years?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some of which could be answered via qualt research, some via quant, and some through a mix</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
We started by speaking to funders because<ul>
<li>It made sense to follow the money (funding → research → publication → impact)</li>
<li>It was more manageable</li>
<li>
We spoke to <ul>
<li>
Philanthropic funders<ul>
<li>Wellcome</li>
<li>Sloan Foundation</li>
<li>Open Society</li>
<li>Ford Foundation</li>
<li>Lloyd’s Register Foundation</li>
<li>Nuffield Foundation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
UK Research and Innovation (UKRI)<ul>
<li>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) </li>
<li>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</li>
<li>Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</li>

<li>Interested in understanding (a) general information about the organisation – core goals or mission, governance paradigm, and sector, (b) type of funding organisation – the functions it fulfils or services it provides, (c) main activities and projects going on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Interviews with funders<ul>
<li>Type of funders [research councils, philanthropic bodies, all doing research in the UK, interested in data-related topics] </li>
<li>
We asked them about<ul>
<li>The role they see for themselves in the data-related research landscape</li>
<li>How they decide which topics to fund</li>
<li>How the application review process works</li>
<li>If/how they track the impact they have</li>
<li>If/how they engage with other funders as part of the funding process</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
We then moved to quantitatively analyse funding, research, publication, impact<ul>
<li>
We first identified datasets that would enable us to answer our research questions, each of which has specific benefits and limitations<ul>
<li>GtR</li>
<li>360Giving</li>
<li>Lens Scholar (mention and thank Lens - probably also mention Lens near each table or chart)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Defined our parameters<ul>
<li>
Ten keywords chosen from Data 2020<ul>
<li>
For the sake of simplicity, we adopted an initial, heuristic definition of ‘data-related research’ as a cluster of ten keywords drawn from the ten ‘hot topics’ in  <a href="https://theodi.org/article/data-2020/">Data 2020</a> .<ul>
<li>Data ethics</li>
<li>Data sharing</li>
<li>Misinformation</li>
<li>Data infrastructure</li>
<li>Digital economy</li>
<li>Value of data</li>
<li>Data rights</li>
<li>Data literacy</li>
<li>Digital trade</li>
<li>Automated decision-making</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Had to start somewhere in terms of what we meant by ‘data-related research’<ul>
<li>With the intention of then expanding and snowballing these terms into adjacent terms, related areas etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This was the ODI’s estimation of what would be important in 2020, so this also enabled us to check our work in a sense… to see whether those topics were indeed as important as predicted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Which is why we decided to focus on 2020-2021<ul>
<li>We had wanted to analyse ten years, but the amount of time and labour needed to clean and cull a dataset that large was beyond the bounds of this project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
UK<ul>
<li>
For now we are focusing on UK funders, but we would like to expand beyond that.<ul>
<li>For 360Giving, it’s exclusively UK funders</li>
<li>For GtR it’s UK government research councils</li>
<li>
For Lens, it is based on location of publication (???) <ul>
<li>(but this doesn’t appear to be accurate for every article. There are some that are not UK-based publications)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Downloaded the relevant datasets</li>
<li>Cleaned them</li>
<li>Culled them</li>
<li>Analysed them</li>
<li>
The process and resulting datasets come with a number of caveats… <ul>
<li>Time intensive</li>
<li>Lens returned some results that didn’t appear to include any of our search terms(???)</li>
<li>Within Lens, filtering by ‘the UK’ meant the place of publication not researcher (???)</li>
<li>INSERT: anything else… </li>
<li>Some articles in Lens are classed as journal articles because they come from a journal, but in reality they are book reviews, letters to the editor, reports on conferences, corrections, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
We then moved to communicate the findings and the value of the process and infrastructure<ul>
<li>Experimenting by presenting the findings in two different formats</li>
<li>The datasets are available online (can/ do we want to publish the datasets?)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recognition of “data-related research” as a field</h2>
<p>From the interviews, there seems to be general agreement that there is an emerging but fragmented field of research around data and its impact. There seems to be no specific definition of the field, as none of the participants have given one. Generally speaking, the field seems to be understood as emerging and often under-funded; for instance, someone from the Lloyd's Register Foundation said that “that type of space is historically a very underfunded community [and] . . . we fund mostly engineering”. Additionally, the details characterising each answer have differed from interview to interview depending on the role of the person interviewed. Indeed, people with a more technical background have defined the field around concepts such as data availability: “...essentially, we're creating whole new fields of quantitative data research that did not exist before, because the data just wasn't there” (participant X, ESRC - ADR UK Investment). On the contrary, people with a more social-sciences-based understanding spoke about the field in terms of accessibility, justice, and participation. Someone from Ford Foundation, for instance, said that “... lots of our work relevant to data has been about ensuring that values like justice, equity, accountability, transparency, consent, autonomy, and generally speaking, just that, that most needs and preferences of most impacted populations are being centred in the way we think about data” (participant X, Ford Foundation). Finally, again, although people agree that “a field that does research <em>about</em> data” exists, there seems to be a high degree of fragmentation and it is still rather hard to define it clearly.</p>
<h2>Recognition that the field is fragmented and the reasons why that is challenging</h2>
<p>[xxx]</p>
<h2>Criteria to decide what to fund - agenda setters / followers</h2>
<p>From the interviews, it seems that the criteria to decide what to fund are more about the quality of applications (‘we fund what is of high quality’) than they are about the topics investigated. Possibly because of the fragmentation of the field, indeed, it seems that funders are happy with any research being broadly related to their area(s) of research, and specifically focus on the feasibility and quality of the application. As one participant noted, “...all of [the] proposals will be batched in the same way, and then there will be assessment criteria based on quality” (participant X, Innovate UK).
Moreover, based on interviews, the process of deciding what to fund in terms of topics to focus on seems to be a rather informal one, with input coming from both internal and external stimuli in a non-structured manner.
Finally, it is worth noting how a lot of the organisations and funders we have spoken to seem to be both “agenda setters” and “agenda followers”; however, it is important to make a distinction between those whose agenda is set by an overall purpose (e.g. social justice, as in the case of Ford Foundation) or if that is broadly dictated by the overarching goal of funding research (as in the case of the research councils). For future research, it may be interesting to possibly dig deeper into the relationship between public/private funding and agenda setting processes.</p>
<h2>Degree of collaboration and visibility of other funders in the field</h2>
<p>Broadly speaking, there seems to be visibility of others’ work in the field and a good degree of collaboration and exchange between funders. “I probably have at least one conversation during the week where I speak with a peer at another organisation” (participant X, McGovern Foundation). However, this seems to be mainly through personal connections developed through years of working in the field. Possibly, the process relies too much on individuals and its being rather informal makes it hard for new entrants to the system due to lack of formal network and tacit knowledge of the space. Indeed, as noted by someone with a rather relevant experience in the field, “...I've been in philanthropy for a while now . . . I feel we have a fairly strong network in philanthropy and in the data space, specifically” (participant X, McGovern Foundation). The personal / individual / informal nature of these processes also seems to be potentially challenging in terms of the transparency of the process as well as with respect to the space left for potentially unexplored territories as a result of an established network that acts as a filter bubble.</p>
<h2>Data-related research in the foreseeable future</h2>
<p>The future of data-related research seems to be tied to the question of whether or not funders have a specific purpose that goes beyond funding research. Indeed, seeing the funding process as the means to a goal rather than the goal itself seems to lead to a difference in approach in terms of intentionally setting the research agenda and looking to the future with that specific perspective. For instance, someone mentioned how they <em>hope</em> to see topics such as data justice more at the centre of the data-related research agenda, and how their organisations seem to be heading that way: “I hope that it becomes second nature to think about power in conjunction with data . . . I am really thinking and hoping that we are going to see a shift there that like, you know, we're not going to keep talking about data driven technology without talking about how power is being distributed and or, or redistributed” (participant X, Ford Foundation).
The choices about what to fund next are thus guided by an overarching, thematic, internal objective rather than by external influences. Moreover, those with no specific objective beyond funding and contributing research seem to have a harder time defining the future of the data-related research landscape; as one participant noted in an interview, breadth of topics is what really matters: “...it's more about getting that breadth of sort of topic of research area covered” (participant X, ESRC - ADR UK Investment). </p>
<h1>Supporting/ challenging our qualt findings with quant evidence</h1>
<ul>
<li>
In order to compare our qualt and quant findings, we analysed the funding portfolios of two of the funders we spoke to over the last [10?] years<ul>
<li>
We chose to examine two government funders ESRC and Innovate UK<ul>
<li>
Below we outline the questions we asked and the findings we uncovered… <ul>
<li>
Has their funding for data-related research increased over those ten years? <ul>
<li>In total amount? </li>

<li>As a percentage of that funder’s total funding budget? </li>
<li>Has their funding for a specific data-related topic increased or decreased?</li>

<h2>How much funding is being directed at each of the ten keywords from ‘Data 2020’?</h2>

<h3>QUESTIONS TO ANSWER: How many different ‘fields of study’ and areas of research is ‘data-related’ research spread across?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ONE</strong>: Using the ‘fields of study’ in the Lens dataset, is it possible to produce a list of all the fields of study in our culled dataset, ranked by the number of times that the field of study appeared in our dataset? <strong>DONE</strong><ul>
<li>This should help us expand our list of ten ‘data-related’ keywords (which were admittedly chosen semi at random based on the contents of Data 2020) to a larger set of 20-30 fields of study that can be used to define the WIP boundaries of data-related research.</li>
<li>
It should also help us replace any of the ten keywords that may have a better, more standardised field of study that we should be searching for.<ul>
<li>For instance, ‘data rights’ does not appear as a field of study in our dataset, but ‘digital rights’ does. Possibly data rights is not an established field of study. Going forward, we could search for digital rights instead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We could then continue this process in the future by searching for other relevant keywords that seem to be missing from our list, download the related articles, cull them to ensure they are relevant, then add any new relevant fields of study to our growing list of standardised fields of study within the emerging field of ‘data-related research’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>TWO</strong>: Using the fields of study in the Lens dataset, is it possible to define the top 5-10 fields of study relevant to each of our ten keywords? eg for those articles tagged as ‘automated decision-making’, what are the top 5-10 fields of study?<ul>
<li>This would be helpful to better target searches for topics that do not have clear keywords or search terms. For instance, ‘automated decision making’ is not a field of study in our dataset. Knowing the top five fields of study related to the articles we tagged as ‘automated decision making’ would potentially help people interested in automated decision-making to target their search to capture relevant articles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>THREE</strong>: Using the ‘fields of study’ from the Lens dataset, is it possible to visualise the wide landscape of academic research (math(s), physics, chemistry, biology, social science, arts and humanities, etc) and then show the amount of ‘data-related research’ being conducted within each of those areas? <ul>
<li>Basically a cluster diagram similar to this one about meta-research (research on research) being conducted in different fields…
[image:9D85ED8A-0D9A-476D-B6DA-1A6B875B2118-73672-000000DBCA7EBD7D/xASAQqIyXVMgEPtgPWTTHTP9FZQY8ScWj5tKLDcI22oJsbmnrRrHY8Bz_nKVXcIXZaO9lvK8URASYByZM4iI-vbtriF_ndOSD-SbT2H5UgkDp5MJcGJABGGX5AW3TZCcDJFUJOyy.png]
Possibly using  <a href="https://www.vosviewer.com/">this free(?) tool</a>  recommended to us by RORI</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Short of this, even a list of fields of study related to different areas of academic research would be useful - eg a list showing fields of study related to math(s), biology, computer science, social science, economics, arts and humanities, etc</li>
</ul>
<h1>Potential uses for different audiences</h1>
<ul>
<li>Researchers</li>
<li>Funders</li>
<li>Users of research</li>
<li>Policymakers</li>
<li>Research on research</li>
</ul>
<h1>Gaps and how to fill them</h1>
<ul>
<li><em>Basically a repeat of the gap-related points from the short summary report (see section below)</em></li>
</ul>
<h1>Ideas for further work (basically an internal/external sales pitch for funding to continue work on this area)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall pitch</strong></li>
<li>There is a problem here, and we don’t know the answer, but we are committed to following up, including through further research, collaborations and playing a role as a convener… </li>
<li>
<strong>Filling in the landscape outside of government-funded academic research</strong><ul>
<li>
In the short term, further work to track funding within academia across different funders, regions, types of funding for specific topics. <ul>
<li>Sites like 360Giving and Gateway to Research provide some of this functionality, but not a wide enough view. How could this be improved?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
In the medium term, further work could focus on the non-academic world to confirm whether:<ul>
<li>
It is <em>~possible~</em> to fill some of these gaps, eg by going directly to non-academic research orgs to link funding, projects and outputs<ul>
<li>
What other orgs are trying to map grey literature? Are these services useful?<ul>
<li>Overton</li>
<li>Dimensions includes some policy/government reports</li>
<li>Altmetrics tracks some relevant aspects</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is <em>~useful~</em> to fill these gaps to get a more holistic view of research about data - eg being able to trace research about data from funding to output for more than just academic orgs. Can academic and non-academic be combined in an easy/meaningful way?</li>
<li>It is <em>~difficult~</em> to fill these gaps, possibly because it is time consuming with fewer systems in place</li>
<li>(aka Dr Land 2.0 - The Squeakquel) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
In the long term, the ODI could explore how to convene different parties and stakeholders from inside/outside academic to work to fill in the gap around ‘grey literature’<ul>
<li>
Convene events and workshops with relevant stakeholders<ul>
<li>Eg an event with the members which is partly about gauging whether they also see a challenge and what they think might be the solutions… </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Explore options for adopting and adapting standards used within academia to track research outside of academia</li>
<li>Explore options for tracking non-academic research beyond of the standard methods used within academia</li>
<li>
To lead by example, the ODI could publish <strong>its own</strong> reports and outputs in a way that is aligned with or interoperable with existing academic systems, eg by:<ul>
<li>Identifying whether workable systems, schemas and publishing standards exist to publish, catalogue and connect its own to academic research</li>
<li>Demonstrating the value of doing this</li>
<li>Working with other non-academic orgs to understand their views on the matter and possibly co-designing ways of moving forward, eg by pushing the adoption of publishing standards and/or cataloguing outputs from non-academic orgs to submit them to sites like Lens Scholar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Work to produce a semi-automated way of searching databases like Lens and OpenAlex</strong><ul>
<li>Every article in Lens has a list of relevant keywords and fields of study. Since we hand-culled the datasets, they should be relevant. </li>
<li>
Meaning we now have a fairly expansive set of keywords and fields of study that can serve as a starting point to define the rough boundaries of ‘data-related research’. <ul>
<li>We also have lists of fields of study for each of our ten keywords</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
We should be able to repurpose those lists to help us - and others - to search for ‘data-related research more efficiently and effectively, eg<ul>
<li>
For someone interested in data ethics we might be able to point them to:<ul>
<li>The top 10 keywords to include with their search in order to narrow down the results and reject unuseful articles</li>
<li>The top related academic disciplines/ fields of study</li>
<li>Areas of overlap with other concepts or keywords</li>
<li>The top journal articles to focus on</li>
<li>The top research organisations working in that field</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h1>Sketching the short summary report</h1>
<h3>NB: What are we aiming to achieve with the piece?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
How <strong>does</strong> this compare to the longer research report?<ul>
<li>
This short summary aims to put forward an argument, backed up by evidence at each stage, regardless of whether that is qualt evidence from interviews, quant evidence or desk research. It is meant to demonstrate the importance of the work and the challenge and convince people (internally/ externally) to collaborate with us to tackle this challenge… <ul>
<li>The longer research report, on the other hand, is roughly chronological and lays out the bulk of our findings as well as our methodology. In a way, it is annex where those who are interested to learn more can turn for further detail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Primary aims</strong></li>
<li>Make the case that there is a field of data-related research, with lots of overlapping interest, research activity, terminology, but ultimately fragmented</li>
<li>Provide at least some visibility of the fragmented field of data-related research for funders, researchers and potential users of research findings</li>
<li>Advertise the value of high level views of funding research, publications </li>
<li>Make a case for further work</li>
<li><strong>Secondary aims</strong></li>
<li>Communicate interesting findings from our work</li>
<li>
Advertise the value of this kind of quant research<ul>
<li>(can be pushed internally, so not a primary goal within this short piece)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Describe the infrastructure we've produced and advertise the value of it for the ODI (and possibly others) <ul>
<li>(can be pushed internally, so not a primary goal within this short piece)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Basic format</h3>
<ul>
<li>10-15 slides with a few sentences on the left, paired with some form of evidence on the right - eg a quote, image, table or chart</li>
</ul>
<h1>Initial outline</h1>
<p><em>NB: I find it difficult to work collaboratively in google Slides, so I’m recommending we work in google Docs as long as possible before transferring the short summary report over to a slide deck. To that end, I have arranged the short summary report as a table with 20 rows, with the rough draft of the text/prose on the left and initial ideas for evidence (tables, charts, graphs, images, quotes, etc) on the right. This can roughly approximate a slide with text on the left and some sort of visual on the right. I hope it will be easier to work collaboratively within this format than in google slides</em></p>
<p>Slide </p>

<p>Text/ prose
Evidence (eg a quote, image, table or chart)

<strong>Section 1: [Introducing the value and challenge]</strong></p>
<p>Data is important and is having an impact (seemingly) everywhere.
INSERT: Collage of headlines/titles from media articles and research reports alluding to the importance of data and its widespread impacts… </p>
<p>OR: QUOTE from external report or article
2
Because of this, research about data, its value, management, uses and impacts - what we call 'data-related research' - is being conducted nearly everywhere, sometimes in places you wouldn't expect. </p>
<ul>
<li>Inside and outside academia (private and public sector, third sector, media, consultancy, industry - ie grey literature) </li>
<li>'Pure and applied' </li>
<li>Newer fields built explicitly around data like 'critical data studies' and older, more established fields like agriculture and [art?]
INSERT: Collage of reports and articles from the wide range of places mentioned above.
3
And yet, despite the widespread importance of data in so many diverse parts of life] - or perhaps because of its widespread importance - it is extremely difficult to have a comprehensive view of all the research, writing and communication about data out there. </li>
</ul>
<p>Since data is everywhere, research about data is everywhere. </p>
<p>4
The fragmented and dispersed nature of this research field makes it difficult… </p>
<ul>
<li>… for researchers to identify relevant results in adjacent areas of enquiry, build on previous work, collaborate on shared interests, or coordinate to avoid duplicated effort. </li>
<li>… for the audience and users of this research to locate and recognise research findings, insights and evidence that are relevant to their circumstances and needs. This can lead to [silos and people re-inventing techniques which were used in other domains - but don't know how to even find this]</li>
<li>… for funders of data-related research and for those working to encourage research in this area to [coordinate, have visibility, spot peaks and troughs, etc.]</li>
</ul>
<p>5
In 2021 we conducted research aimed at identifying whether it is possible to produce a high-level overview of research related to data, its value, management, uses and impacts. </p>
<p>Our broader aims were to catalogue research, knowledge and thought related to data, and proactively identify emerging data-related topics worthy of investigation.</p>
<p>6
Though definitions differ, our research [found broad agreement] that there is indeed a burgeoning field of data-related research
INSERT EVIDENCE from interviews: Either, a nice quote from an interviewee or something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“We spoke to ## people working to fund research about data in some shape or form within philanthropic and government organisations, and # agreed…”<br>
7
But while there seems to be agreement that a field of research is developing around data, it is fragmented and dispersed. Unlike other disciplines or areas of inquiry where it is easier to draw a boundary around relevant topics, results and methods of investigation, this is much more difficult [when attempting to gather research about data, its value, etc etc]</li>
</ul>
<p>There are fields that cover parts of that landscape - eg data studies or [INSERT another] - but even these have overlaps with other fields and don't cover everything… </p>
<p>The terminology also makes it difficult (different words for similar concepts. Not enough time for the field to coalesce around shared terminology.)
INSERT EVIDENCE from interviews: Either, a nice quote from an interviewee or something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“We spoke to ## people working to fund research about data in some shape or form within philanthropic and government organisations, and # agreed…”
AND/OR: back this up with quant evidence, eg:</li>
<li>A search in Lens Scholar for ten keywords related to data and data-related research returned #### articles published from Jan 2020 (see the research report for details)…</li>
<li>Those articles came from ### different [fields of research / university departments] ranging from [computer science and data studies to art, agriculture and philosophy, etc]
8
<strong>Section 2: [Filling in some of the landscape]</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>However, using some totes sweet quant methods it is possible to begin sketching the broad contours of the landscape of data-related research. </p>
<p>We identified three [open/ free] databases that contained information on funding and research related to data and developed a list of 10 keywords that roughly approximate data-related research. </p>
<p>The process is time and labour intensive, but by searching these databases for 10 keywords we were able to identify the main funders, research orgs, publications and departments /fields within the landscape of data-related research in the UK over the last two years. (For more on our findings, our methodology and the limitations of some of the databases we used, see the research report…)
INSERT: logos of Lens, GtR and 360Giving?
OR: our ten keywords?

<em>Discussion of main funders…</em>

<p>14
<strong>Section 3: [Spotlighting gaps and outlining future work]</strong></p>
<p>However these results are based on an extremely small section of the entire landscape, in large part because there are major gaps in the evidence base. </p>
<p>15
One gap is related to open v paid access</p>
<p>Many of the best systems for tracking research and funding exist behind paywalls. </p>
<ul>
<li>Fully paid: Elsevier, Scopus, Web of Science</li>
<li>Part-paid: Dimensions </li>
</ul>
<p>Many universities and research organisations of course pay for access to these, but for many people and smaller research orgs, these costs are prohibitive… </p>
<p>16
Another major gap is related to funding info</p>
<p>There is not much info about funding within many of the services that exist to track funding and research - paid or free. (OPTIONAL INSERT: Paraphrase quote from openalex: it is difficult to get funding data from open sources…)</p>
<p>When you restrict your search to research with funding details within a site like Lens Scholar, it is a very small percentage. Of our corpus of ### data-related research articles from 2020-2021, only ## list their funding info </p>
<p>The funding that is captured in services like Lens or 360Giving is largely government funding, but some philanthropics are good at publishing data. </p>
<p>On the whole, many articles do not state their funding sources, and most other funders (private sector, third sector) don’t seem to publish details about their funding.</p>
<p>The current setup therefore misses funding from third sector research institutes, industry, consultancies, tech companies, the media etc, potentially leading to blind spots, silos duplication of effort.
OUTDATED INFO, but this indicates scale…

<p>Table showing the proportion of ‘data-related’ research publications in our Lens Scholar dataset that have enough data attached to make it possible to track: funding org, funder project, recipient org, recipient researcher, outputs and impact</p>
<p>17
Another large gap is research outside of academia… Much research about data is ‘grey literature’ and does not appear to be captured in current systems for tracking funding, research, outputs, impact etc.</p>
<p>This is a problem because a lot of excellent thought leadership and advances in this field can and does happen outside of academia in research institutes, government, industry, consultancies, tech companies, the media etc and important conversations happen outside of academic journals - eg in non-academic conferences, the media, on social media.

<p>OR: list of the major research orgs, consultancies, industry orgs etc that are not captured in current systems, as well as some of the major conferences, newspapers, etc
18
Two groups are talking about similar concepts without much collaboration. For instance, the ODI’s publications do not appear within these tracking and lit review systems (eg Lens) nor do they appear in academic publications. Similarly, academic publications do not feature in our lit reviews or in our publications. </p>
<p>But many of the research projects and papers contained in our dataset would be relevant to the ODI. (Presumably the same would be true of the value of our research for academics.)
INSERT: a search of Lens or OpenAlex to see the extent to which orgs like the ODI, Ada, CDEI are cited in academic articles
AND: a search of ODI, Ada, CDEI literature to see how often academic articles are cited
19
Our work has demonstrated the value of mapping parts of the landscape of data-related research and of being able to track government-funded academic research. </p>
<p>But there are gaps in the landscape that need to be filled - particularly around documenting and tracking non-government funding and non-academic research. </p>
<p>Until these gaps are filled, funders, researchers and those who use research findings will struggle to develop [even a moderately comprehensive] view of the entire landscape of data-related research. </p>
<p>20
We are committed to addressing these problems, including by working to convene interested people and organisations to understand the challenges better and co-develop strategise to address them. </p>
<p>We welcome any and all help. </p>
<p>Please let us know if you are interested in joining us. </p>

and approach (borrowed from intro to short summary report)** * Data is important and is having an impact (seemingly) everywhere. * Because of this, research about data, its value, management, uses and impacts - what we call \u2018data-related research\u2019 - is being conducted nearly everywhere, sometimes in places you wouldn\u2019t expect. * Inside and outside academia (private and public sector, third sector, media, consultancy, industry - ie grey literature) * \u2018Pure and applied\u2019 * Newer fields built explicitly around data like \u2018critical data studies\u2019 and older, more established fields like agriculture and [art?] * And yet, despite the widespread importance of data in so many diverse parts of life] - or perhaps because of its widespread importance - it is extremely difficult to have a comprehensive view of all the research, writing and communication about data out there. * Since data is everywhere, research about data is everywhere. * The fragmented and dispersed nature of this research field makes it difficult\u2026 * \u2026 for researchers to identify relevant results in adjacent areas of enquiry, build on previous work, collaborate on shared interests, or coordinate to avoid duplicated effort. * \u2026 for the audience and users of this research to locate and recognise research findings, insights and evidence that are relevant to their circumstances and needs. This can lead to [silos and people re-inventing techniques which were used in other domains - but don\u2019t know how to even find this] * \u2026 for funders of data-related research and for those working to encourage research in this area to [coordinate, have visibility, spot peaks and troughs, etc.] * To help provide visibility of this field of research, trace developments and link funding, research and impact, we conducted a [9 month?] mixed-methods research project\u2026 * We drew on methodologies such as landscape reviews, \u2018research on research\u2019, scientometric analysis, bibliometric analysis which have demonstrated their value in other fields of investigation and research such as funding for AI and cancer research\u2026 * [If useful, could cite from] * [https://www.diigo.com/item/pdf/8cpku/je07](https://www.diigo.com/item/pdf/8cpku/je07) * [https://diigo.com/0nr6ek](https://diigo.com/0nr6ek) * [https://diigo.com/0nr6fr](https://diigo.com/0nr6fr) * [https://diigo.com/0nr6hq](https://diigo.com/0nr6hq) * The methodologies can even be used to examine the link between funding, research and impact in the past - which can help to understand the present and think strategically about the future * [If useful, could cite from] * [https://diigo.com/0nr6jg](https://diigo.com/0nr6jg) * We believe this research will be useful for a range of audiences * For funders * \u2026 more targeted in their funding, not be behind the curve, know what topics are hot right now, * For researchers\u2026 * [xxx] * For those who use research results\u2026 * [xxx] * [Brief outline of the structure of the rest of the report\u2026] # Approach/ methodology and overview of research question(s) * We worked from the ground up - letting the field emerge from the analysis rather than pre-defining the boundaries of the field * *Borrow as much as possible from the launch blog post and work note, eg why we\u2019re not trying to define the boundaries of the field (ie working from the ground up) and starting with funders (ie tracing the funding cycle)* * Our research questions were\u2026 * Our main research question was: What is going on in the data-related research landscape? * Our secondary research questions were: * Who is funding research in this area? * In the UK, who are the major funders of \u2018data-related research\u2019 - ie research about data, its value, uses and impacts? * How much funding do they direct toward \u2018data-related research\u2019 each year? How much in past years? How much is planned for future years? * What is the process for securing funding/ what are the requirements? * What \u2018data-related\u2019 topics are being funded by these organisations? * What is currently big in the world of data, tech, policy, governance, new uses of data, etc.? * What are going to be the next big things in data over the next one, five, ten years? * Some of which could be answered via qualt research, some via quant, and some through a mix * We started by speaking to funders because * It made sense to follow the money (funding \u2192 research \u2192 publication \u2192 impact) * It was more manageable * We spoke to * Philanthropic funders * Wellcome * Sloan Foundation * Open Society * Ford Foundation * Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation * Nuffield Foundation * UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) * Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) * Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) * Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) * Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) * Medical Research Council (MRC) * Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) * Innovate UK * Brief description of methods (but not too much - people understand interviews and thematic coding of transcripts) * Desk research on funders * Interested in understanding (a) general information about the organisation \u2013 core goals or mission, governance paradigm, and sector, (b) type of funding organisation \u2013 the functions it fulfils or services it provides, (c) main activities and projects going on. * Interviews with funders * Type of funders [research councils, philanthropic bodies, all doing research in the UK, interested in data-related topics] * We asked them about * The role they see for themselves in the data-related research landscape * How they decide which topics to fund * How the application review process works * If/how they track the impact they have * If/how they engage with other funders as part of the funding process * We then moved to quantitatively analyse funding, research, publication, impact * We first identified datasets that would enable us to answer our research questions, each of which has specific benefits and limitations * GtR * 360Giving * Lens Scholar (mention and thank Lens - probably also mention Lens near each table or chart) * Defined our parameters * Ten keywords chosen from Data 2020 * For the sake of simplicity, we adopted an initial, heuristic definition of \u2018data-related research\u2019 as a cluster of ten keywords drawn from the ten \u2018hot topics\u2019 in [Data 2020](https://theodi.org/article/data-2020/) . * Data ethics * Data sharing * Misinformation * Data infrastructure * Digital economy * Value of data * Data rights * Data literacy * Digital trade * Automated decision-making * Had to start somewhere in terms of what we meant by \u2018data-related research\u2019 * With the intention of then expanding and snowballing these terms into adjacent terms, related areas etc. * This was the ODI\u2019s estimation of what would be important in 2020, so this also enabled us to check our work in a sense\u2026 to see whether those topics were indeed as important as predicted. * Which is why we decided to focus on 2020-2021 * We had wanted to analyse ten years, but the amount of time and labour needed to clean and cull a dataset that large was beyond the bounds of this project * UK * For now we are focusing on UK funders, but we would like to expand beyond that. * For 360Giving, it\u2019s exclusively UK funders * For GtR it\u2019s UK government research councils * For Lens, it is based on location of publication (???) * (but this doesn\u2019t appear to be accurate for every article.

There seems to be no specific definition of the field, as none of the participants have given one. Generally speaking, the field seems to be understood as emerging and often under-funded; for instance, someone from the Lloyd\u0027s Register Foundation said that \u201cthat type of space is historically a very underfunded community [and] . . . we fund mostly engineering\u201d. Additionally, the details characterising each answer have differed from interview to interview depending on the role of the person interviewed. Indeed, people with a more technical background have defined the field around concepts such as data availability: \u201c...essentially, we\u0027re creating whole new fields of quantitative data research that did not exist before, because the data just wasn\u0027t there\u201d (participant X, ESRC - ADR UK Investment). On the contrary, people with a more social-sciences-based understanding spoke about the field in terms of accessibility, justice, and participation. Someone from Ford Foundation, for instance, said that \u201c... lots of our work relevant to data has been about ensuring that values like justice, equity, accountability, transparency, consent, autonomy, and generally speaking, just that, that most needs and preferences of most impacted populations are being centred in the way we think about data\u201d (participant X, Ford Foundation). Finally, again, although people agree that \u201ca field that does research *about* data\u201d exists, there seems to be a high degree of fragmentation and it is still rather hard to define it clearly. ## Recognition that the field is fragmented and the reasons why that is challenging [xxx] ## Criteria to decide what to fund - agenda setters / followers From the interviews, it seems that the criteria to decide what to fund are more about the quality of applications (\u2018we fund what is of high quality\u2019) than they are about the topics investigated. Possibly because of the fragmentation of the field, indeed, it seems that funders are happy with any research being broadly related to their area(s) of research, and specifically focus on the feasibility and quality of the application. As one participant noted, \u201c...all of [the] proposals will be batched in the same way, and then there will be assessment criteria based on quality\u201d (participant X, Innovate UK). Moreover, based on interviews, the process of deciding what to fund in terms of topics to focus on seems to be a rather informal one, with input coming from both internal and external stimuli in a non-structured manner. Finally, it is worth noting how a lot of the organisations and funders we have spoken to seem to be both \u201cagenda setters\u201d and \u201cagenda followers\u201d; however, it is important to make a distinction between those whose agenda is set by an overall purpose (e.g. social justice, as in the case of Ford Foundation) or if that is broadly dictated by the overarching goal of funding research (as in the case of the research councils). For future research, it may be interesting to possibly dig deeper into the relationship between public/private funding and agenda setting processes. ## Degree of collaboration and visibility of other funders in the field Broadly speaking, there seems to be visibility of others\u2019 work in the field and a good degree of collaboration and exchange between funders. \u201cI probably have at least one conversation during the week where I speak with a peer at another organisation\u201d (participant X, McGovern Foundation). However, this seems to be mainly through personal connections developed through years of working in the field. Possibly, the process relies too much on individuals and its being rather informal makes it hard for new entrants to the system due to lack of formal network and tacit knowledge of the space. Indeed, as noted by someone with a rather relevant experience in the field, \u201c...I\u0027ve been in philanthropy for a while now . . . I feel we have a fairly strong network in philanthropy and in the data space, specifically\u201d (participant X, McGovern Foundation). The personal / individual / informal nature of these processes also seems to be potentially challenging in terms of the transparency of the process as well as with respect to the space left for potentially unexplored territories as a result of an established network that acts as a filter bubble. ## Data-related research in the foreseeable future The future of data-related research seems to be tied to the question of whether or not funders have a specific purpose that goes beyond funding research. Indeed, seeing the funding process as the means to a goal rather than the goal itself seems to lead to a difference in approach in terms of intentionally setting the research agenda and looking to the future with that specific perspective. For instance, someone mentioned how they *hope* to see topics such as data justice more at the centre of the data-related research agenda, and how their organisations seem to be heading that way: \u201cI hope that it becomes second nature to think about power in conjunction with data . . . I am really thinking and hoping that we are going to see a shift there that like, you know, we\u0027re not going to keep talking about data driven technology without talking about how power is being distributed and or, or redistributed\u201d (participant X, Ford Foundation). The choices about what to fund next are thus guided by an overarching, thematic, internal objective rather than by external influences. Moreover, those with no specific objective beyond funding and contributing research seem to have a harder time defining the future of the data-related research landscape; as one participant noted in an interview, breadth of topics is what really matters: \u201c...it\u0027s more about getting that breadth of sort of topic of research area covered\u201d (participant X, ESRC - ADR UK Investment). # Supporting/ challenging our qualt findings with quant evidence * In order to compare our qualt and quant findings, we analysed the funding portfolios of two of the funders we spoke to over the last [10?] years * We chose to examine two government funders ESRC and Innovate UK * Below we outline the questions we asked and the findings we uncovered\u2026 * Has their funding for data-related research increased over those ten years?

Possibly data rights is not an established field of study. Going forward, we could search for digital rights instead * We could then continue this process in the future by searching for other relevant keywords that seem to be missing from our list, download the related articles, cull them to ensure they are relevant, then add any new relevant fields of study to our growing list of standardised fields of study within the emerging field of \u2018data-related research\u2019 * **TWO**: Using the fields of study in the Lens dataset, is it possible to define the top 5-10 fields of study relevant to each of our ten keywords? eg for those articles tagged as \u2018automated decision-making\u2019, what are the top 5-10 fields of study? * This would be helpful to better target searches for topics that do not have clear keywords or search terms. For instance, \u2018automated decision making\u2019 is not a field of study in our dataset. Knowing the top five fields of study related to the articles we tagged as \u2018automated decision making\u2019 would potentially help people interested in automated decision-making to target their search to capture relevant articles. * **THREE**: Using the \u2018fields of study\u2019 from the Lens dataset, is it possible to visualise the wide landscape of academic research (math(s), physics, chemistry, biology, social science, arts and humanities, etc) and then show the amount of \u2018data-related research\u2019 being conducted within each of those areas? * Basically a cluster diagram similar to this one about meta-research (research on research) being conducted in different fields\u2026 [image:9D85ED8A-0D9A-476D-B6DA-1A6B875B2118-73672-000000DBCA7EBD7D/xASAQqIyXVMgEPtgPWTTHTP9FZQY8ScWj5tKLDcI22oJsbmnrRrHY8Bz_nKVXcIXZaO9lvK8URASYByZM4iI-vbtriF_ndOSD-SbT2H5UgkDp5MJcGJABGGX5AW3TZCcDJFUJOyy.png] Possibly using [this free(?) tool](https://www.vosviewer.com/) recommended to us by RORI * Short of this, even a list of fields of study related to different areas of academic research would be useful - eg a list showing fields of study related to math(s), biology, computer science, social science, economics, arts and humanities, etc # Potential uses for different audiences * Researchers * Funders * Users of research * Policymakers * Research on research # Gaps and how to fill them * *Basically a repeat of the gap-related points from the short summary report (see section below)* # Ideas for further work (basically an internal/external sales pitch for funding to continue work on this area) * **Overall pitch** * There is a problem here, and we don\u2019t know the answer, but we are committed to following up, including through further research, collaborations and playing a role as a convener\u2026 * **Filling in the landscape outside of government-funded academic research** * In the short term, further work to track funding within academia across different funders, regions, types of funding for specific topics. * Sites like 360Giving and Gateway to Research provide some of this functionality, but not a wide enough view. How could this be improved? * In the medium term, further work could focus on the non-academic world to confirm whether: * It is *~possible~* to fill some of these gaps, eg by going directly to non-academic research orgs to link funding, projects and outputs * What other orgs are trying to map grey literature? Are these services useful? * Overton * Dimensions includes some policy/government reports * Altmetrics tracks some relevant aspects * It is *~useful~* to fill these gaps to get a more holistic view of research about data - eg being able to trace research about data from funding to output for more than just academic orgs. Can academic and non-academic be combined in an easy/meaningful way? * It is *~difficult~* to fill these gaps, possibly because it is time consuming with fewer systems in place * (aka Dr Land 2.0 - The Squeakquel) * In the long term, the ODI could explore how to convene different parties and stakeholders from inside/outside academic to work to fill in the gap around \u2018grey literature\u2019 * Convene events and workshops with relevant stakeholders * Eg an event with the members which is partly about gauging whether they also see a challenge and what they think might be the solutions\u2026 * Explore options for adopting and adapting standards used within academia to track research outside of academia * Explore options for tracking non-academic research beyond of the standard methods used within academia * To lead by example, the ODI could publish **its own** reports and outputs in a way that is aligned with or interoperable with existing academic systems, eg by: * Identifying whether workable systems, schemas and publishing standards exist to publish, catalogue and connect its own to academic research * Demonstrating the value of doing this * Working with other non-academic orgs to understand their views on the matter and possibly co-designing ways of moving forward, eg by pushing the adoption of publishing standards and/or cataloguing outputs from non-academic orgs to submit them to sites like Lens Scholar * **Work to produce a semi-automated way of searching databases like Lens and OpenAlex** * Every article in Lens has a list of relevant keywords and fields of study. Since we hand-culled the datasets, they should be relevant. * Meaning we now have a fairly expansive set of keywords and fields of study that can serve as a starting point to define the rough boundaries of \u2018data-related research\u2019. * We also have lists of fields of study for each of our ten keywords * We should be able to repurpose those lists to help us - and others - to search for \u2018data-related research more efficiently and effectively, eg * For someone interested in data ethics we might be able to point them to: * The top 10 keywords to include with their search in order to narrow down the results and reject unuseful articles * The top related academic disciplines/ fields of study * Areas of overlap with other concepts or keywords * The top journal articles to focus on * The top research organisations working in that field * **Making our datasets and/or infrastructure available externally** * OPTIONAL: An ~~interactive dashboard~~ or simply a spreadsheet that interested parties can use to conduct their own research in this area * The data we use should be available to download * Assuming the platforms share data with appropriate licenses (Lens might be quite restrictive?) * Visualisations should also be reusable * An airtable with some of our datasets that is open and viewable # Sketching the short summary report ### NB: What are we aiming to achieve with the piece? * How **does** this compare to the longer research report? * This short summary aims to put forward an argument, backed up by evidence at each stage, regardless of whether that is qualt evidence from interviews, quant evidence or desk research. It is meant to demonstrate the importance of the work and the challenge and convince people (internally/ externally) to collaborate with us to tackle this challenge\u2026 * The longer research report, on the other hand, is roughly chronological and lays out the bulk of our findings as well as our methodology. In a way, it is annex where those who are interested to learn more can turn for further detail. * **Primary aims** * Make the case that there is a field of data-related research, with lots of overlapping interest, research activity, terminology, but ultimately fragmented * Provide at least some visibility of the fragmented field of data-related research for funders, researchers and potential users of research findings * Advertise the value of high level views of funding research, publications * Make a case for further work * **Secondary aims** * Communicate interesting findings from our work * Advertise the value of this kind of quant research * (can be pushed internally, so not a primary goal within this short piece) * Describe the infrastructure we\u0027ve produced and advertise the value of it for the ODI (and possibly others) * (can be pushed internally, so not a primary goal within this short piece) ### Basic format * 10-15 slides with a few sentences on the left, paired with some form of evidence on the right - eg a quote, image, table or chart # Initial outline *NB: I find it difficult to work collaboratively in google Slides, so I\u2019m recommending we work in google Docs as long as possible before transferring the short summary report over to a slide deck. To that end, I have arranged the short summary report as a table with 20 rows, with the rough draft of the text/prose on the left and initial ideas for evidence (tables, charts, graphs, images, quotes, etc) on the right. This can roughly approximate a slide with text on the left and some sort of visual on the right.

Since data is everywhere, research about data is everywhere. 4 The fragmented and dispersed nature of this research field makes it difficult\u2026 * \u2026 for researchers to identify relevant results in adjacent areas of enquiry, build on previous work, collaborate on shared interests, or coordinate to avoid duplicated effort. * \u2026 for the audience and users of this research to locate and recognise research findings, insights and evidence that are relevant to their circumstances and needs.

Our broader aims were to catalogue research, knowledge and thought related to data, and proactively identify emerging data-related topics worthy of investigation. 6 Though definitions differ, our research [found broad agreement] that there is indeed a burgeoning field of data-related research INSERT EVIDENCE from interviews: Either, a nice quote from an interviewee or something like: * \u201cWe spoke to ## people working to fund research about data in some shape or form within philanthropic and government organisations, and # agreed\u2026\u201d 7 But while there seems to be agreement that a field of research is developing around data, it is fragmented and dispersed. Unlike other disciplines or areas of inquiry where it is easier to draw a boundary around relevant topics, results and methods of investigation, this is much more difficult [when attempting to gather research about data, its value, etc etc] There are fields that cover parts of that landscape - eg data studies or [INSERT another] - but even these have overlaps with other fields and don\u0027t cover everything\u2026 The terminology also makes it difficult (different words for similar concepts. Not enough time for the field to coalesce around shared terminology.) INSERT EVIDENCE from interviews: Either, a nice quote from an interviewee or something like: * \u201cWe spoke to ## people working to fund research about data in some shape or form within philanthropic and government organisations, and # agreed\u2026\u201d AND/OR: back this up with quant evidence, eg: * A search in Lens Scholar for ten keywords related to data and data-related research returned #### articles published from Jan 2020 (see the research report for details)\u2026 * Those articles came from ### different [fields of research / university departments] ranging from [computer science and data studies to art, agriculture and philosophy, etc] 8 **Section 2: [Filling in some of the landscape]** However, using some totes sweet quant methods it is possible to begin sketching the broad contours of the landscape of data-related research. We identified three [open/ free] databases that contained information on funding and research related to data and developed a list of 10 keywords that roughly approximate data-related research. The process is time and labour intensive, but by searching these databases for 10 keywords we were able to identify the main funders, research orgs, publications and departments /fields within the landscape of data-related research in the UK over the last two years. (For more on our findings, our methodology and the limitations of some of the databases we used, see the research report\u2026) INSERT: logos of Lens, GtR and 360Giving? OR: our ten keywords? 9 *Discussion of main funders\u2026* INSERT: tables, charts or graphs with a bit of explanation (NB: This could involve choosing one database and one metric for a given question - eg the main research orgs, using Lens Scholar data, based on the number of publications\u2026) 10 *Discussion of main research orgs\u2026* INSERT: tables, charts or graphs with a bit of explanation (NB: This could involve choosing one database and one metric for a given question - eg the main research orgs, using Lens Scholar data, based on the number of publications\u2026) 11 *Discussion of main journals\u2026* INSERT: tables, charts or graphs with a bit of explanation (NB: This could involve choosing one database and one metric for a given question - eg the main research orgs, using Lens Scholar data, based on the number of publications\u2026) 12 *Discussion of main fields of study\u2026* INSERT: tables, charts or graphs with a bit of explanation (NB: This could involve choosing one database and one metric for a given question - eg the main research orgs, using Lens Scholar data, based on the number of publications\u2026) 13 These results and this type of analysis can be useful for: * Researchers looking for * Areas of major activity * Staying up to date on emerging ideas and topics * Overlapping interest/investigation and potential for mutual benefit * Lit reviews * Potential sources of funding * Identifying experts to collaborate with * Users of research interested in * Relevant research in unexpected fields * Collaborators and experts * Funders looking to * Identify peaks and troughs of funding across the field * Understand the funding focus of other funders * Stay up to date on emerging ideas and technologies worth funding 14 **Section 3: [Spotlighting gaps and outlining future work]** However these results are based on an extremely small section of the entire landscape, in large part because there are major gaps in the evidence base. 15 One gap is related to open v paid access Many of the best systems for tracking research and funding exist behind paywalls. * Fully paid: Elsevier, Scopus, Web of Science * Part-paid: Dimensions Many universities and research organisations of course pay for access to these, but for many people and smaller research orgs, these costs are prohibitive\u2026 16 Another major gap is related to funding info There is not much info about funding within many of the services that exist to track funding and research - paid or free. (OPTIONAL INSERT: Paraphrase quote from openalex: it is difficult to get funding data from open sources\u2026) When you restrict your search to research with funding details within a site like Lens Scholar, it is a very small percentage. Of our corpus of ### data-related research articles from 2020-2021, only ## list their funding info The funding that is captured in services like Lens or 360Giving is largely government funding, but some philanthropics are good at publishing data. On the whole, many articles do not state their funding sources, and most other funders (private sector, third sector) don\u2019t seem to publish details about their funding. The current setup therefore misses funding from third sector research institutes, industry, consultancies, tech companies, the media etc, potentially leading to blind spots, silos duplication of effort.

INSERT: quote from article about the misconception of innovation flowing from academia out to society\u2026 OR: list of the major research orgs, consultancies, industry orgs etc that are not captured in current systems, as well as some of the major conferences, newspapers, etc 18 Two groups are talking about similar concepts without much collaboration. For instance, the ODI\u2019s publications do not appear within these tracking and lit review systems (eg Lens) nor do they appear in academic publications. Similarly, academic publications do not feature in our lit reviews or in our publications. But many of the research projects and papers contained in our dataset would be relevant to the ODI. (Presumably the same would be true of the value of our research for academics.) INSERT: a search of Lens or OpenAlex to see the extent to which orgs like the ODI, Ada, CDEI are cited in academic articles AND: a search of ODI, Ada, CDEI literature to see how often academic articles are cited 19 Our work has demonstrated the value of mapping parts of the landscape of data-related research and of being able to track government-funded academic research. But there are gaps in the landscape that need to be filled - particularly around documenting and tracking non-government funding and non-academic research. Until these gaps are filled, funders, researchers and those who use research findings will struggle to develop [even a moderately comprehensive] view of the entire landscape of data-related research. 20 We are committed to addressing these problems, including by working to convene interested people and organisations to understand the challenges better and co-develop strategise to address them. We welcome any and all help. Please let us know if you are interested in joining us.",

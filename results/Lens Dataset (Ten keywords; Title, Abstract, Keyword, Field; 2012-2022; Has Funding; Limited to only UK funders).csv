0,000-003-026-358-523,The Response of Governments and Public Health Agencies to COVID-19 Pandemics on Social Media: A Multi-Country Analysis of Twitter Discourse.,2021-09-28,2021,journal article,Frontiers in public health,22962565,Frontiers Media SA,Switzerland,Lan Li; Aisha Aldosery; Fedor Vitiugin; Naomi Limaro Nathan; David Novillo-Ortiz; Carlos Castillo; Patty Kostkova,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, information is being rapidly shared by public health experts and researchers through social media platforms. Whilst government policies were disseminated and discussed, fake news and misinformation simultaneously created a corresponding wave of ""infodemics."" This study analyzed the discourse on Twitter in several languages, investigating the reactions to government and public health agency social media accounts that share policy decisions and official messages. The study collected messages from 21 official Twitter accounts of governments and public health authorities in the UK, US, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, Spain, and Nigeria, from 15 March to 29 May 2020. Over 2 million tweets in various languages were analyzed using a mixed-methods approach to understand the messages both quantitatively and qualitatively. Using automatic, text-based clustering, five topics were identified for each account and then categorized into 10 emerging themes. Identified themes include political, socio-economic, and population-protection issues, encompassing global, national, and individual levels. A comparison was performed amongst the seven countries analyzed and the United Kingdom (Scotland, Northern Ireland, and England) to find similarities and differences between countries and government agencies. Despite the difference in language, country of origin, epidemiological contexts within the countries, significant similarities emerged. Our results suggest that other than general announcement and reportage messages, the most-discussed topic is evidence-based leadership and policymaking, followed by how to manage socio-economic consequences.",9,,716333,716333,Public policy; Agency (sociology); Public health; Government; Political science; Misinformation; Country of origin; Public relations; Social media; Politics,COVID-19; Twitter; government; public health agencies; public health emergencies; social media; topic modeling,COVID-19; Government; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media,,UK Research and Innovation; Fundación Bancaria Caixa d'Estalvis i Pensions de Barcelona; Horizon 2020; China Scholarship Council,http://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.716333/full https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-1470771 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.716333/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505807 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34650948/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.716333,34650948,10.3389/fpubh.2021.716333,3202227403,PMC8505807,0,001-319-834-337-875; 001-479-664-655-354; 010-227-909-667-253; 010-499-894-600-900; 014-701-830-171-774; 015-320-546-451-020; 019-607-968-445-249; 021-233-286-331-445; 026-700-966-968-214; 029-264-538-240-48X; 033-327-335-131-750; 037-550-015-414-716; 040-047-705-785-207; 040-449-439-149-567; 043-176-367-866-388; 044-145-808-467-644; 048-186-213-908-70X; 050-932-841-455-178; 059-421-143-841-314; 060-498-079-842-929; 062-399-319-516-479; 064-774-395-319-869; 065-283-349-515-500; 066-354-515-441-968; 066-955-949-169-061; 076-251-207-412-605; 077-286-743-641-846; 080-087-025-081-158; 084-942-070-996-859; 086-170-461-196-969; 110-017-679-247-041; 112-328-366-372-109; 133-367-849-875-601; 144-721-114-370-002; 151-532-298-520-386; 171-055-587-503-116,3

In practice a group of data owners often adopt a heterogeneous security scheme under which each pair of parties decide their own protocol to share data with diverse levels of trust. The scheme also keeps track of how the data is used. This paper studies distributed SQL query answering in the heterogeneous security setting. We define query plans by incorporating toll functions determined by data sharing agreements and reflected in the use of various security facilities. We formalize query answering as a bi-criteria optimization problem, to minimize both data sharing toll and parallel query evaluation cost. We show that this problem is PSPACE-hard for SQL and Σ_3^p-hard for SPC, and it is in NEXPTIME. Despite the hardness, we develop a set of approximate algorithms to generate distributed query plans that minimize data sharing toll and reduce parallel evaluation cost. Using real-life and synthetic data, we empirically verify the effectiveness, scalability and efficiency of our algorithms.",,,575,585,Distributed computing; Set (abstract data type); Data sharing; Cryptographic protocol; Computer science; Scalability; SQL; Distributed database; Protocol (object-oriented programming),,,,EPSRC; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award; ERC,https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/querying-shared-data-with-security-heterogeneity https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3318464.3389784 https://repository.ust.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-104368 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sigmod/sigmod2020.html#0012FWY20 https://doi.org/10.1145/3318464.3389784 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/143085316/Querying_Shared_Data_CAO_DOA07042020_AFV.pdf http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sigmod/sigmod2020.html#0012FWY20 https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/143085316/Querying_Shared_Data_CAO_DOA07042020_AFV.pdf http://doi.org/10.1145/3318464.3389784 https://core.ac.uk/download/326499339.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3318464.3389784,,10.1145/3318464.3389784,3032617209,,0,004-876-544-396-499; 024-234-308-937-020; 028-563-943-513-465; 028-878-214-142-189; 030-682-441-981-123; 032-444-169-846-14X; 035-652-229-608-959; 039-385-600-577-256; 053-654-742-432-407; 057-291-995-513-518; 058-125-515-978-694; 065-649-082-481-519; 072-228-886-166-176; 072-925-707-168-533; 081-990-069-962-595; 086-048-732-755-680; 089-509-040-724-70X; 091-162-644-050-904; 096-602-293-819-707; 098-793-600-927-36X; 099-190-191-361-652; 107-561-736-253-087; 109-505-582-199-335; 114-986-229-965-626; 115-574-966-111-335; 118-380-586-291-200; 120-409-331-777-573; 122-307-285-269-708; 122-664-819-729-859; 125-322-550-986-383; 136-408-519-662-870; 138-145-909-870-246; 140-165-363-293-87X; 157-096-851-727-578; 185-901-831-344-531; 188-198-692-141-263,1

We assessed the prevalence of and factors associated with the use of cooking fuels, and attitudes and barriers towards use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This was a cross-sectional, population-based survey conducted in 519 households in Lagos, Nigeria. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain information regarding choice of household cooking fuel and the attitudes towards the use of LPG. Kerosene was the most frequently used cooking fuel (n = 475, 91.5%; primary use n = 364, 70.1%) followed by charcoal (n = 159, 30.6%; primary use n = 88, 17%) and LPG (n = 86, 16.6%; primary use n = 63, 12.1%). Higher level of education, higher income and younger age were associated with LPG vs. kerosene use. Fuel expenditure on LPG was significantly lower than for kerosene ( N (Naira) 2169.0 ± 1507.0 vs. N 2581.6 ± 1407.5). Over 90% of non-LPG users were willing to switch to LPG but cited safety issues and high cost as potential barriers to switching. Our findings suggest that misinformation and beliefs regarding benefits, safety and cost of LPG are important barriers to LPG use. An educational intervention program could be a cost-effective approach to improve LPG adoption and should be formally addressed through a well-designed community-based intervention study.",15,4,641,,Business; Liquefied petroleum gas; Passive smoking; Misinformation; Kerosene; Population; Health risk; Petroleum; Air pollution; Environmental health,attitudes and barriers; cooking fuels; kerosene; liquefied petroleum gas,"Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Choice Behavior; Cooking/methods; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Kerosene; Male; Middle Aged; Nigeria; Petroleum; Surveys and Questionnaires",Kerosene; Petroleum,Medical Research Council (MR/L002515/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L009242/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/P022006/1) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC5923683 https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/4/641 https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15040641 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5923683 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29614713/ https://core.ac.uk/display/156978132 https://archive.lstmed.ac.uk/8494/ https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/4/641/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/157583300.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph15040641,29614713,10.3390/ijerph15040641,2795190144,PMC5923683,0,005-666-692-393-784; 015-005-732-971-652; 015-455-041-499-481; 019-067-225-834-935; 021-891-057-101-173; 029-276-167-511-428; 056-773-716-515-613; 059-688-586-577-586; 063-725-226-097-989; 064-999-445-427-321; 068-606-012-075-442; 068-911-788-866-808; 071-192-510-822-296; 072-636-325-051-101; 074-012-768-661-424; 074-616-506-595-591; 086-742-295-230-850; 089-104-477-077-183; 089-402-863-441-225; 099-570-493-799-283; 122-736-519-917-41X,17

Mawdsley; R. Smith,Abstract Introduction Acute admissions to hospital are rising. As a part of a service evaluation we examined pathways of patients following hospital discharge depending on data available on admission to hospital. Methods We merged data available on admission to the Wrexham Maelor hospital from an existing data-base in the Acute Medical Unit with follow up data from local social services as part of a data sharing agreement. Patients requiring support by social services post-discharge were matched with patients not requiring social services from the same post-code. Results Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified candidate variables predicting likely support need. Decision tree analysis identified sub-groups of patients with higher likelihood to require support by social services after discharge from hospital. We found patients with normal physiology on admission as evidenced by a value of zero for the National Early Warning Score who were frail or older than 85 years were most likely to require support after discharge. Conclusions Information available on admission to hospital might inform long term care needs. Prospective testing is needed. The algorithms are prone to be dependent on availability of local services but our methodology is expected to be transferable to other organizations.,45,,74,77,Social work; Stepwise regression; Emergency medicine; Triage; Early warning score; Data sharing; Long-term care; Service (business); Social Welfare; Medical emergency; Medicine,Frailty; Hospital; Patient discharge; Social work; Triage,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Frail Elderly; Humans; Logistic Models; Long-Term Care; Male; Patient Discharge; Prospective Studies; Social Work; United Kingdom",,Health Foundation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28974330 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28974330 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0953620517303771 https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/en/researchoutputs/anticipating-care-needs-of-patients-after-discharge-from-hospital(d14d27be-07a3-4f76-a369-938c89857f38).html https://research.bangor.ac.uk/portal/files/19876181/2017_Anticipating_care_needs.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28974330/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2017.09.029,28974330,10.1016/j.ejim.2017.09.029,2757835608,,0,009-273-212-487-748; 011-377-754-016-543; 016-857-306-761-640; 016-891-354-745-126; 017-728-038-131-153; 032-248-885-953-626; 041-262-806-108-676; 047-311-023-513-292; 079-084-717-797-799; 081-612-475-673-731; 089-405-309-502-397; 089-700-024-543-402; 103-071-013-955-299; 110-593-755-750-374,1

This study estimates the costs and benefits of acupuncture, braces, heat treatment, insoles, interferential therapy, laser/light therapy, manual therapy, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, pulsed electrical stimulation, pulsed electromagnetic fields, static magnets and transcutaneous electrical nerve Stimulation (TENS), based on all relevant data, to facilitate a more complete assessment of value. METHODS: Data from 88 randomised controlled trials including 7,507 patients were obtained from a systematic review. The studies reported a wide range of outcomes. These were converted into EQ-5D index values using prediction models, and synthesised using network meta-analysis. Analyses were conducted including firstly all trials and secondly only trials with low risk of selection bias. Resource use was estimated from trials, expert opinion and the literature. A decision analytic model synthesised all evidence to assess interventions over a typical treatment period (constant benefit over eight weeks or linear increase in effect over weeks zero to eight and dissipation over weeks eight to 16). RESULTS: When all trials are considered, TENS is cost-effective at thresholds of £20-30,000 per QALY with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £2,690 per QALY vs. usual care. When trials with a low risk of selection bias are considered, acupuncture is cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £13,502 per QALY vs. TENS. The results of the analysis were sensitive to varying the intensity, with which interventions were delivered, and the magnitude and duration of intervention effects on EQ-5D. CONCLUSIONS: Using the £20,000 per QALY NICE threshold results in TENS being cost-effective if all trials are considered. If only higher quality trials are considered, acupuncture is cost-effective at this threshold, and thresholds down to £14,000 per QALY.",12,3,1,18,Quality of life; Physical therapy; Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; Cost effectiveness; Selection bias; Manual therapy; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Acupuncture; Medicine; Meta-analysis,,"Combined Modality Therapy; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Osteoarthritis, Knee/therapy; Physical Therapy Modalities/economics; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome",,Department of Health (CDF-2009-02-21) United Kingdom; NCI NIH HHS (P30 CA008748) United States; NCCIH NIH HHS (R01 AT006794) United States; Department of Health (RP-PG-0707-10186) United Kingdom,https://core.ac.uk/display/80840321 https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/113963/ https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172749 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172749 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28267751/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28267751 https://ideas.repec.org/a/plo/pone00/0172749.html http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PLoSO..1272749W/abstract https://paperity.org/p/80346378/cost-effectiveness-of-adjunct-non-pharmacological-interventions-for-osteoarthritis-of-the https://core.ac.uk/download/80840321.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0172749,28267751,10.1371/journal.pone.0172749,2594593698,PMC5340388,0,000-924-183-805-215; 003-343-744-410-998; 004-611-534-176-034; 006-041-544-542-801; 008-888-845-257-779; 010-910-401-620-346; 013-061-936-590-046; 013-201-981-837-476; 014-491-015-325-703; 017-765-922-644-50X; 018-748-860-177-468; 018-977-386-305-045; 019-114-222-124-590; 024-548-457-750-739; 025-799-812-921-68X; 029-937-738-381-096; 032-736-768-933-653; 033-796-476-645-255; 035-049-663-852-43X; 035-111-652-654-408; 039-119-285-724-559; 043-008-723-496-756; 044-441-198-757-252; 060-253-389-384-913; 071-352-509-698-937; 078-567-259-796-827; 081-297-077-009-360; 087-861-265-252-010; 113-600-046-227-929; 113-819-776-215-782; 129-987-310-974-174; 158-478-852-505-571,41

Comeau,"BioC is a simple XML format for text, annotations and relations, and was developed to achieve interoperability for biomedical text processing. Following the success of BioC in BioCreative IV, the BioCreative V BioC track addressed a collaborative task to build an assistant system for BioGRID curation. In this paper, we describe the framework of the collaborative BioC task and discuss our findings based on the user survey. This track consisted of eight subtasks including gene/protein/organism named entity recognition, protein-protein/genetic interaction passage identification and annotation visualization. Using BioC as their data-sharing and communication medium, nine teams, world-wide, participated and contributed either new methods or improvements of existing tools to address different subtasks of the BioC track. Results from different teams were shared in BioC and made available to other teams as they addressed different subtasks of the track. In the end, all submitted runs were merged using a machine learning classifier to produce an optimized output. The biocurator assistant system was evaluated by four BioGRID curators in terms of practical usability. The curators' feedback was overall positive and highlighted the user-friendly design and the convenient gene/protein curation tool based on text mining.Database URL: http://www.biocreative.org/tasks/biocreative-v/track-1-bioc/.",2016,2016,baw121,,World Wide Web; Biocurator; Usability; Learning classifier system; Interoperability; Information retrieval; Annotation; Named-entity recognition; Task (project management); Computer science; XML,,Data Curation/methods; Data Mining/methods; Electronic Data Processing/methods; Information Dissemination/methods,,NIH HHS (R01 OD010929) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (R13 GM109648) United States; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/F010486/1) United Kingdom; NIGMS NIH HHS (P20 GM103446) United States; NIH HHS (R24 OD011194) United States,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27589962 https://paperity.org/p/77829249/biocreative-v-bioc-track-overview-collaborative-biocurator-assistant-task-for-biogrid https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baw121/2630510 https://tmu.pure.elsevier.com/zh/publications/biocreative-v-bioc-track-overview-collaborative-biocurator-assist https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/biodb/biodb2016.html#KimDCCORBCAMSCO16 http://database.oxfordjournals.org/content/2016/baw121.full.pdf+html https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/database/baw121 https://core.ac.uk/display/146464126 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/biocreative-v-bioc-track-overview(bd9aa139-5a02-40cf-b156-c87eb68c026e).html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5009341/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5009341/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27589962/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/database/baw121,27589962,10.1093/database/baw121,2509885322,PMC5009341,0,001-643-261-960-030; 003-196-471-039-494; 004-483-887-708-610; 010-231-149-663-509; 011-255-715-363-66X; 011-789-294-107-540; 012-160-318-620-655; 013-942-421-737-838; 018-470-500-040-501; 035-921-722-995-676; 037-408-902-262-096; 037-890-331-455-203; 038-700-811-658-268; 039-921-226-707-992; 040-064-282-648-781; 041-237-458-180-473; 041-500-327-024-687; 048-456-952-865-747; 051-750-274-701-318; 051-768-144-484-314; 063-152-748-790-048; 064-831-425-602-55X; 065-751-855-369-301; 068-526-519-920-780; 075-397-524-884-476; 077-203-596-435-308; 078-772-780-538-071; 084-729-110-644-346; 088-860-423-648-718; 094-146-864-746-857; 095-058-459-803-551; 096-432-972-112-974; 103-762-062-718-110; 104-741-273-210-855; 117-435-078-513-443; 120-002-526-452-598; 122-920-366-406-984; 140-416-037-842-451; 152-560-120-751-288; 152-670-855-872-838; 163-942-201-444-186; 164-210-339-438-777; 167-393-114-658-561; 171-211-242-817-517; 171-616-574-440-512; 177-505-191-794-07X; 178-229-033-223-974; 186-226-181-300-157; 190-130-002-004-28X; 192-473-673-830-336; 198-004-647-437-895,24

Many research groups worldwide have generated large amounts of such toxicogenomics data. However, there is no centralized repository for archiving and making these data and associated tools for their analysis easily available.; ; Results: The Data Infrastructure for Chemical Safety Assessment (diXa) is a robust and sustainable infrastructure storing toxicogenomics data. A central data warehouse is connected to a portal with links to chemical information and molecular and phenotype data. diXa is publicly available through a user-friendly web interface. New data can be readily deposited into diXa using guidelines and templates available online.

Such data can include household and even personal information. Personal location data can give valuable insights with relevance for energy consumption. Movement patterns and occupancy states help with scheduling of appliances, heating loads or storage, and other applications may yet emerge. Many smart home business models rely on data for their service provision. The potential upsides from the use of personal location data are met with growing concerns over information privacy. We present results from a representative UK survey on attitudes towards location data sharing. Our findings suggest that many of the resulting service benefits are widely appreciated. However, trust in the organisations delivering them is low and may inhibit their uptake. Less than 20% of people are were willing to share their location data with an energy utility. In addition, the sense of control over location data appears low. Only 15% claim to understand who had access to their location data and 70% of participants feel that these settings are outside their control. These findings pose challenges for policy and regulation of data access. We make policy recommendations that seek to ensure smart solutions are not inhibited by a lack of public trust. In some cases this may require default settings that better match public expectations of data sharing defaults.",68,,101534,,Internet privacy; Information privacy; Business; Personally identifiable information; Public trust; Data sharing; Energy consumption; Business model; Data access; Default,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:ce37d9d3-4a45-4375-a066-de1184c11162 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620301110,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2020.101534,,10.1016/j.erss.2020.101534,3023853301,,0,000-125-194-861-852; 001-263-482-949-965; 003-048-116-204-550; 006-920-056-147-088; 008-520-904-929-964; 008-655-086-964-407; 012-785-305-017-996; 013-241-024-670-447; 014-600-673-350-951; 018-100-238-873-242; 020-082-906-863-425; 021-381-665-462-589; 028-417-616-262-093; 034-013-116-573-959; 034-282-747-041-495; 036-333-683-002-242; 042-434-541-474-412; 044-045-659-029-860; 045-361-437-461-499; 045-799-360-862-986; 046-384-098-397-303; 050-720-943-042-556; 051-471-753-720-071; 057-689-909-095-090; 059-637-451-221-996; 060-964-293-475-424; 064-387-058-206-177; 073-631-819-798-524; 077-191-047-777-959; 077-232-444-945-133; 078-386-168-383-530; 079-377-267-070-312; 081-600-593-915-57X; 082-762-395-595-26X; 086-417-908-071-460; 088-421-809-744-118; 092-192-310-376-633; 095-408-263-492-162; 098-049-809-670-184; 098-730-441-058-831; 118-490-365-646-239; 127-832-999-057-261; 139-189-246-538-808; 140-443-727-628-317; 154-035-924-328-36X; 181-717-458-110-714; 185-321-316-960-996; 193-973-999-921-77X,3

The survey combines health, lifestyle and socioeconomic questionnaire data with standardised biophysical measurements, biomarkers for non-communicable and infectious diseases, and genetic data. Data collection for the study is currently underway and the target sample size is 10 000 participants. The DDS has an established infrastructure for survey fieldwork, data collection and management, sample processing and storage, managed data sharing and consent for re-approaching participants, which can be utilised for further research studies. As such, the DDS represents a rich platform for investigating the distribution, interrelation and aetiology of chronic diseases and their risk factors, which is critical for developing health care policies for disease management and prevention.

Khodiyar; Andrew L. Hufton; Susanna-Assunta Sansone,"Sharing of experimental clinical research data usually happens between individuals or research groups rather than via public repositories, in part due to the need to protect research participant privacy. This approach to data sharing makes it difficult to connect journal articles with their underlying datasets and is often insufficient for ensuring access to data in the long term. Voluntary data sharing services such as the Yale Open Data Access (YODA) and Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR) projects have increased accessibility to clinical datasets for secondary uses while protecting patient privacy and the legitimacy of secondary analyses but these resources are generally disconnected from journal articles—where researchers typically search for reliable information to inform future research. New scholarly journal and article types dedicated to increasing accessibility of research data have emerged in recent years and, in general, journals are developing stronger links with data repositories. There is a need for increased collaboration between journals, data repositories, researchers, funders, and voluntary data sharing services to increase the visibility and reliability of clinical research. Using the journal Scientific Data as a case study, we propose and show examples of changes to the format and peer-review process for journal articles to more robustly link them to data that are only available on request. We also propose additional features for data repositories to better accommodate non-public clinical datasets, including Data Use Agreements (DUAs).",1,1,6,6,Research ethics; Data science; Open access journal; Research participant; Data sharing; Open data; Information repository; Computer science; Science education; Data access,Data Journal; Data Repository; Journal Article; Open Access Journal; Scientific Data,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793987/ https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-016-0015-6 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29451541/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29451541 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41073-016-0015-6 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs41073-016-0015-6.pdf https://paperity.org/p/195955953/publishing-descriptions-of-non-public-clinical-datasets-proposed-guidance-for-researchers https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5793987,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41073-016-0015-6,29451541,10.1186/s41073-016-0015-6,2952539298,PMC5793987,0,000-597-621-070-904; 002-054-851-581-525; 004-293-615-740-10X; 004-397-716-192-911; 004-927-101-042-867; 005-720-169-871-782; 006-601-263-455-317; 010-620-745-874-07X; 012-983-393-441-005; 013-822-682-918-470; 015-781-575-530-328; 016-807-311-591-441; 023-982-034-841-976; 024-410-972-405-612; 029-588-284-726-340; 031-303-302-631-258; 033-071-928-266-953; 033-309-626-779-427; 037-283-264-991-764; 041-304-863-075-498; 041-404-724-306-573; 043-767-734-196-051; 052-784-317-014-692; 059-402-420-924-609; 063-156-205-440-998; 066-472-778-120-696; 069-396-325-795-92X; 070-795-330-421-977; 072-961-415-314-920; 077-916-640-645-653; 081-101-116-084-033; 081-306-131-270-108; 098-925-250-067-110; 114-654-851-742-78X; 153-352-707-666-330; 177-729-381-638-505,16

These moves seek to give individuals control and oversight of their personal data. Within shared settings, the consequences of these changes are the large-scale generation of interpersonal data generated by and acting on the group rather than individual. We consider how such systems create new forms of observability and hence accountability among members of the home, and draw on the work of Simmel and Goffman to explore how these demands are managed. Such management mitigates the more extreme possibilities for domestic monitoring posited by these systems, yet without careful design there remains a considerable danger of unanticipated negative consequences.",20,4,1580,1599,Internet privacy; Sociology; Marketing; Interpersonal communication; Data management; Digital economy; Control (management); Accountability; Observability; Home automation; Information and Communications Technology,,,,Seventh Framework Programme; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/nms/nms20.html#GouldenTMLPT18 https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/857693/Living_with_Interpersonal_Data_Observabi.pdf http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444817700154 https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/857681 https://core.ac.uk/display/96621274 https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01516136 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1461444817700154 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444817700154 http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/46940/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1461444817700154,,10.1177/1461444817700154,2608402094,,0,016-094-944-644-964; 016-205-218-637-128; 017-607-582-964-799; 018-296-028-307-100; 028-062-391-566-079; 034-989-548-670-95X; 040-186-781-237-392; 042-962-759-880-068; 047-262-258-118-555; 053-682-667-987-821; 054-186-680-601-093; 074-375-083-916-685; 099-855-469-891-388; 101-293-027-008-98X; 125-477-063-370-190; 132-930-268-095-782,20

In this work, we developed a predictive model of survival at 2 years. The model is based on a large volume of historical patient data and serves as a proof of concept to demonstrate the distributed learning approach. Methods and Materials Clinical data from 698 lung cancer patients, treated with curative intent with chemoradiation or radiation therapy alone, were collected and stored at 2 different cancer institutes (559 patients at Maastro clinic (Netherlands) and 139 at Michigan university [United States]). The model was further validated on 196 patients originating from The Christie (United Kingdon). A Bayesian network model was adapted for distributed learning (the animation can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDJFOxpwqEA ). Two-year posttreatment survival was chosen as the endpoint. The Maastro clinic cohort data are publicly available at https://www.cancerdata.org/publication/developing-and-validating-survival-prediction-model-nsclc-patients-through-distributed , and the developed models can be found at www.predictcancer.org . Results Variables included in the final model were T and N category, age, performance status, and total tumor dose. The model has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 on the external validation set and an AUC of 0.62 on a 5-fold cross validation. A model based on the T and N category performed with an AUC of 0.47 on the validation set, significantly worse than our model (P Conclusions Distributed learning from federated databases allows learning of predictive models on data originating from multiple institutions while avoiding many of the data-sharing barriers.

It is important to understand if their opinions differ from the general public by dint of having a rare disease and vulnerabilities inherent in this. Here we document RD patients' attitudes to participation in genomics research, particularly around large-scale, international data and biosample sharing. This work is unique in exploring the views of people with a range of rare disorders from many different countries. The authors work within an international, multidisciplinary consortium, RD-Connect, which has developed an integrated platform connecting databases, registries, biobanks and clinical bioinformatics for RD research. Focus groups were conducted with 52 RD patients from 16 countries. Using a scenario-based approach, participants were encouraged to raise topics relevant to their own experiences, rather than these being determined by the researcher. Issues include wide data sharing, and consent for new uses of historic samples and for children. Focus group members are positively disposed towards research and towards allowing data and biosamples to be shared internationally. Expressions of trust and attitudes to risk are often affected by the nature of the RD which they have experience of, as well as regulatory and cultural practices in their home country. Participants are concerned about data security and misuse.

Stuart; Darren F. Mark; Pierre Gandanger; Paul McConville,"Abstract The isotopic composition of the noble gases, in particular Ar, in samples of ancient atmosphere trapped in rocks and minerals provides the strongest constraints on the timing and rate of Earth atmosphere formation by degassing of the Earth's interior. We have re-measured the isotopic composition of argon in the Rhynie chert from northeast Scotland using a high precision mass spectrometer in an effort to provide constraints on the composition of Devonian atmosphere. Irradiated chert samples yield 40Ar/36Ar ratios that are often below the modern atmosphere value. The data define a 40Ar/36Ar value of 289.5 ± 0.4 at K/36Ar = 0. Similarly low 40Ar/36Ar are measured in un-irradiated chert samples. The simplest explanation for the low 40Ar/36Ar is the preservation of Devonian atmosphere-derived Ar in the chert, with the intercept value in 40Ar–39Ar–36Ar space representing an upper limit. In this case the Earth's atmosphere has accumulated only 3% ( 5.1 ± 0.4 × 10 16  mol ) of the total 40Ar inventory since the Devonian. The average accumulation rate of 1.27 ± 0.09 × 10 8  mol 40Ar/yr overlaps the rate over the last 800 kyr. This implies that there has been no resolvable temporal change in the outgassing rate of the Earth since the mid-Palaeozoic despite the likely episodicity of Ar degassing from the continental crust. Incorporating the new Devonian atmosphere 40Ar/36Ar into the Earth degassing model of Pujol et al. (2013) provides the most precise constraints on atmosphere formation so far. The atmosphere formed in the first ∼100 Ma after initial accretion during a catastrophic degassing episode. A significant volume of 40Ar did not start to accumulate in the atmosphere until after 4 Ga which implies that stable K-rich continental crust did not develop until this time.",446,,21,26,Outgassing; Devonian; Geology; Continental crust; Atmosphere; Atmosphere of Earth; Geochemistry; Earth (classical element); Accretion (meteorology); Argon,,,,NERC; SUERC; Ecole Centrale Lyon,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016E&PSL.446...21S/abstract http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16301686 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/119126/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X16301686,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2016.04.012,,10.1016/j.epsl.2016.04.012,2346456829,,0,001-875-901-197-399; 005-877-460-004-743; 007-746-802-197-876; 010-524-033-600-820; 013-509-319-664-233; 013-823-718-646-054; 014-454-128-263-294; 015-975-576-023-606; 023-186-562-302-573; 025-843-278-056-723; 026-738-701-039-042; 027-777-551-040-125; 028-314-828-196-938; 031-660-879-148-311; 033-204-042-057-788; 036-611-639-133-250; 038-096-762-994-629; 041-522-473-093-020; 041-980-015-568-269; 042-970-893-761-078; 043-760-758-168-280; 049-239-376-848-775; 054-096-081-860-81X; 058-004-947-510-795; 060-787-498-531-181; 062-304-291-074-335; 064-627-003-815-995; 065-247-463-421-358; 066-735-262-261-043; 070-975-130-244-679; 072-251-809-358-655; 077-335-850-319-914; 077-992-858-926-751; 080-424-093-364-998; 087-622-920-105-685; 087-662-100-726-300; 106-739-598-411-989; 110-886-057-044-957; 115-999-681-940-336; 128-546-016-940-344; 131-584-226-082-70X; 143-891-496-589-645; 145-540-775-440-585; 147-342-907-395-225; 148-767-381-927-679; 149-494-675-337-231; 152-586-211-452-828; 165-089-927-015-652; 166-849-775-247-168; 171-726-283-461-847; 182-854-668-190-940; 186-181-966-456-534; 196-413-777-305-107,13

While it is possible to fund development of data management systems, currently it is more difficult to sustain data resources beyond the original grants. That puts the safety of the data at risk and undermines the very purpose of data gathering. ; PlaSMo stands for ‘Plant Systems-biology Modelling’ and the PlaSMo model repository was envisioned by the plant systems biology community in 2005 with the initial funding lasting until 2010. We addressed the sustainability of the PlaSMo repository and assured preservation of these data by implementing an exit strategy. For our exit strategy we migrated data to an alternative, public repository with secured funding. We describe details of our decision process and aspects of the implementation.

A number of international academic groups have developed and parameterized mathematical models of disease spread to forecast the trajectory of the outbreak. These modeling efforts often relied on limited epidemiological data to derive key transmission and severity parameters, which are needed to calibrate mechanistic models. Here, we provide a perspective on some of the challenges and lessons drawn from these efforts, focusing on (1) data availability and accuracy of early forecasts; (2) the ability of different models to capture the profile of early growth dynamics in local outbreaks and the importance of reactive behavior changes and case clustering; (3) challenges in forecasting the long-term epidemic impact very early in the outbreak; and (4) ways to move forward. We conclude that rapid availability of aggregated population-level data and detailed information on a subset of transmission chains is crucial to characterize transmission patterns, while ensemble-forecasting approaches could limit the uncertainty of any individual model. We believe that coordinated forecasting efforts, combined with rapid dissemination of disease predictions and underlying epidemiological data in shared online platforms, will be critical in optimizing the response to current and future infectious disease emergencies.",15,1,42,42,Epidemic model; Data science; Data sharing; Data availability; West africa; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Medicine; Cluster analysis,Data sharing; Disease forecast; Ebola; Epidemic model; Exponential growth; Lessons learned; Polynomial growth; Sub-exponential growth; West Africa,"Africa, Western/epidemiology; Epidemics; Epidemiologic Methods; Forecasting; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola/epidemiology; Humans; Models, Biological",,NIGMS NIH HHS (U54 GM111274) United States; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/M008894/1) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28245814 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-017-0811-y https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28245814 https://hsrc.himmelfarb.gwu.edu/sphhs_global_facpubs/198/ https://forskning.ruc.dk/en/publications/perspectives-on-model-forecasts-of-the-2014-2015-ebola-epidemic-i https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12916-017-0811-y.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/81731723 https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-017-0811-y https://hsrc.himmelfarb.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1197&context=sphhs_global_facpubs,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-017-0811-y,28245814,10.1186/s12916-017-0811-y,2588461319,PMC5331683,0,003-472-622-630-424; 005-165-620-049-591; 007-823-620-536-044; 008-393-920-604-028; 010-439-088-822-248; 010-730-902-066-111; 010-954-911-531-575; 015-463-165-966-125; 015-562-344-593-575; 016-267-593-890-591; 016-408-194-548-226; 017-065-321-691-522; 019-431-685-716-962; 021-575-117-456-394; 021-935-052-933-79X; 022-694-766-782-286; 023-882-410-955-873; 023-952-216-207-418; 025-671-539-422-608; 025-704-080-116-081; 026-980-896-724-335; 031-022-246-402-782; 031-604-374-168-951; 033-897-645-682-878; 036-652-318-631-647; 036-764-887-313-346; 038-744-249-237-283; 040-974-828-680-613; 044-006-128-743-65X; 047-444-181-622-573; 054-615-128-659-649; 057-889-921-749-17X; 059-839-267-287-093; 060-333-230-092-572; 060-769-325-558-74X; 063-037-135-466-874; 067-255-247-217-312; 078-277-318-038-415; 092-425-267-668-968; 094-198-472-338-402; 094-313-850-453-266; 101-418-327-143-047; 112-033-127-186-132; 115-757-496-858-048; 117-584-840-039-106; 128-040-095-697-97X; 145-720-551-618-418; 149-274-500-140-002; 167-861-070-166-382; 180-129-670-599-927; 195-455-050-991-977,57

By leveraging data from a diversity of; populations across the world, the IPD-MA will provide a more precise estimate of the risk of adverse; ZIKV-related outcomes within clinically relevant subgroups and a quantitative assessment of the; generalizability of these estimates across populations and settings. The ZIKV IPD Consortium effort; is indicative of the growing recognition that data sharing is a central component of global health; security and outbreak response.",5,4,152,,Epidemiology; Health care; Zika virus; Family planning; Pregnancy; Miscarriage; Global health; Medicine; Relative risk; Environmental health,Zika virus; congenital Zika syndrome; data sharing; emerging pathogen; individual participant data meta-analysis; microcephaly; prediction model; prognostic model,,,Wellcome Trust (206532/Z/17/Z) United Kingdom; DFID-Wellcome Trust (216002/Z/19/Z),https://repub.eur.nl/pub/133580 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepub.eur.nl%3A133580 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/133580/Repub_133580_O-A.pdf https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/handle/icict/46434 https://www.arca.fiocruz.br/bitstream/icict/46434/2/The%20zika_Guilherme_Calvet_etal_INI_2020.pdf https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk/handle/10026.1/18362,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed5040152,33007828,10.3390/tropicalmed5040152,3149306720,PMC7709585,0,000-955-293-704-134; 007-275-195-177-508; 007-634-818-752-292; 014-045-036-752-464; 018-835-141-128-331; 029-880-810-024-33X; 036-262-752-140-994; 044-104-968-902-210; 046-487-791-903-835; 048-852-013-091-08X; 052-011-134-237-311; 063-669-934-274-129; 064-407-626-275-484; 065-703-199-246-816; 069-104-986-921-623; 073-645-411-705-977; 076-601-920-449-873; 117-847-857-173-119,2

Brown; Luigi Sedda; Chris Sumner; Elene Stefanakos; Irene Ruberto; Matthew Roach,"Mosquito surveillance data can be used for predicting mosquito distribution and dynamics as they relate to human disease. Often these data are collected by independent agencies and aggregated to state and national level portals to characterize broad spatial and temporal dynamics. These larger repositories may also share the data for use in mosquito and/or disease prediction and forecasting models. Assumed, but not always confirmed, is consistency of data across agencies. Subtle differences in reporting may be important for development and the eventual interpretation of predictive models. Using mosquito vector surveillance data from Arizona as a case study, we found differences among agencies in how trapping practices were reported. Inconsistencies in reporting may interfere with quantitative comparisons if the user has only cursory familiarity with mosquito surveillance data. Some inconsistencies can be overcome if they are explicit in the metadata while others may yield biased estimates if they are not changed in how data are recorded. Sharing of metadata and collaboration between modelers and vector control agencies is necessary for improving the quality of the estimations. Efforts to improve sharing, displaying, and comparing vector data from multiple agencies are underway, but existing data must be used with caution.",58,4,1619,1625,Consistency (database systems); Data science; Quality (business); Data sharing; National level; Surveillance data; Vector surveillance; Distribution (economics); Biology; Metadata,data sharing; disease prediction; mosquito-borne disease; vector surveillance,Animals; Arizona; Datasets as Topic; Mosquito Control; Mosquito Vectors,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (212501/Z/18/Z) United Kingdom,https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/152118/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33615382 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33615382/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33615382 https://repository.arizona.edu/handle/10150/661334 https://academic.oup.com/jme/article-abstract/58/4/1619/6146055 https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-medical-entomology/volume-58/issue-4/tjab018/Understanding-Mosquito-Surveillance-Data-for-Analytic-Efforts--A-Case/10.1093/jme/tjab018.full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjab018,33615382,10.1093/jme/tjab018,3129238457,PMC8285009,0,002-531-660-293-626; 004-842-481-550-595; 005-764-499-103-166; 009-572-945-976-696; 009-835-871-453-21X; 012-545-926-055-597; 016-678-050-311-705; 017-072-395-395-158; 017-505-499-740-375; 024-749-285-339-089; 025-559-008-661-941; 027-613-697-293-490; 030-731-609-020-325; 032-445-522-411-222; 034-872-412-315-669; 040-275-048-018-298; 042-137-689-019-175; 042-288-776-353-911; 042-625-132-759-590; 043-881-473-980-014; 044-749-012-029-566; 046-666-995-012-245; 054-528-161-638-617; 055-889-129-080-166; 056-865-704-885-80X; 057-753-429-187-758; 058-304-925-457-14X; 058-831-983-936-944; 060-812-486-500-064; 061-442-063-083-482; 061-760-982-539-448; 061-857-816-554-889; 068-822-186-725-464; 071-624-529-451-006; 097-268-360-138-481; 103-070-826-716-303; 111-983-399-571-766; 112-860-631-740-090; 112-979-676-921-897; 113-140-328-784-26X; 124-138-472-308-299; 125-664-589-481-251; 132-753-279-761-897; 145-538-761-433-592; 146-323-313-885-542; 149-940-131-208-105; 150-981-331-821-242; 155-550-694-974-181; 156-750-309-100-879; 177-066-874-058-280,0

Donnan; Merel van Diepen,"Study question What is the predicted risk of acute kidney injury after orthopaedic surgery and does it affect short term and long term survival? Methods The cohort comprised adults resident in the National Health Service Tayside region of Scotland who underwent orthopaedic surgery from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2011. The model was developed in 6220 patients (two hospitals) and externally validated in 4395 patients from a third hospital. Several preoperative variables were selected for candidate predictors, based on literature, clinical expertise, and availability in the orthopaedic surgery setting. The main outcomes were the development of any severity of acute kidney injury (stages 1-3) within the first postoperative week, and 90 day, one year, and longer term survival. Study answer and limitations Using logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of acute kidney injury were older age, male sex, diabetes, number of prescribed drugs, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and American Society of Anesthesiologists grade. The model’s predictive performance for discrimination was good (C statistic 0.74 in development cohort, 0.70 in validation cohort). Calibration was good in the development cohort and after recalibration in the validation cohort. Only the highest risks were over-predicted. Survival was worse in patients with acute kidney injury compared with those without (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.38 to 1.70). This was most noticeable in the short term (adjusted hazard ratio: 90 day 2.36, 1.94 to 2.87) and diminished over time (90 day-one year 1.40, 1.10 to 1.79; >1 year 1.28, 1.10 to 1.48). The model used routinely collected data in the orthopaedic surgery setting therefore some variables that could potentially improve predictive performance were not available. However, the readily available predictors make the model easily applicable. What this study adds A preoperative risk prediction model consisting of seven predictors for acute kidney injury was developed, with good predictive performance in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Survival was significantly poorer in patients even with mild (stage 1) postoperative acute kidney injury.

Rajpoot; Clare Verrill,"This paper explores ethical issues raised by whole slide image-based computational pathology. After briefly giving examples drawn from some recent literature of advances in this field, we consider some ethical problems it might be thought to pose. These arise from (1) the tension between artificial intelligence (AI) research—with its hunger for more and more data—and the default preference in data ethics and data protection law for the minimisation of personal data collection and processing; (2) the fact that computational pathology lends itself to kinds of data fusion that go against data ethics norms and some norms of biobanking; (3) the fact that AI methods are esoteric and produce results that are sometimes unexplainable (the so-called ‘black box’problem) and (4) the fact that computational pathology is particularly dependent on scanning technology manufacturers with interests of their own in profit-making from data collection. We shall suggest that most of these issues are resolvable.",,,medethics,2020-107024,Biobank; Information technology; Data collection; Preference; Ethical issues; Computational pathology; Field (computer science); Computer science; Engineering ethics; Data Protection Act 1998,human tissue; information technology; pathology; scientific research,,,Innovate UK,https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/early/2021/03/02/medethics-2020-107024.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658334 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33658334/ http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/148312/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33658334 https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2021/03/02/medethics-2020-107024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-107024,33658334,10.1136/medethics-2020-107024,3126495340,,0,002-045-992-394-681; 003-921-849-886-855; 013-155-084-232-878; 013-907-508-083-693; 026-742-574-399-548; 030-651-407-220-062; 033-556-515-713-669; 034-594-270-278-649; 036-994-635-414-312; 037-179-094-025-458; 041-073-326-414-460; 056-893-737-083-078; 058-820-357-594-496; 064-001-794-787-948; 065-150-064-642-697; 069-724-028-880-263; 072-910-072-412-077; 075-934-875-442-056; 076-909-739-853-389; 084-828-674-822-623; 125-810-717-283-966; 160-127-747-382-95X,1

Hicks; Michael Schemann; Michael R. Barnes; Terrence Peter Kenakin; Sébastien Granier; Gareth J. Sanger,"If activation of recombinant G protein-coupled receptors in host cells (by drugs or other ligands) has predictive value, similar data must be obtained with native receptors naturally expressed in tissues. Using mouse and human recombinant κ opioid receptors transfected into a host cell, two selectively-acting compounds (ICI204448, asimadoline) equi-effectively activated both receptors, assessed by measuring two different cell signalling pathways which were equally affected without evidence of bias. In mouse intestine, naturally expressing κ receptors within its nervous system, both compounds also equi-effectively activated the receptor, inhibiting nerve-mediated muscle contraction. However, whereas ICI204448 acted similarly in human intestine, where κ receptors are again expressed within its nervous system, asimadoline was inhibitory only at very high concentrations; instead, low concentrations of asimadoline reduced the activity of ICI204448. This demonstration of species-dependence in activation of native, not recombinant κ receptors may be explained by different mouse/human receptor structures affecting receptor expression and/or interactions with intracellular signalling pathways in native environments, to reveal differences in intrinsic efficacy between receptor agonists. These results have profound implications in drug design for κ and perhaps other receptors, in terms of recombinant-to-native receptor translation, species-dependency and possibly, a need to use human, therapeutically-relevant, not surrogate tissues.",6,1,30797,30797,Immune receptor; Cell signaling; Receptor; 5-HT1 receptor; Asimadoline; Receptor expression; Intrinsic activity; Signal transduction; Biology; Cell biology; Pharmacology,,"Acetamides/pharmacology; Animals; Drug Design; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism; Mice; Pyrrolidines/pharmacology; Receptors, Opioid, kappa/metabolism; Recombinant Proteins/metabolism; Signal Transduction; Species Specificity","Acetamides; Pyrrolidines; Receptors, Opioid, kappa; Recombinant Proteins; asimadoline",Medical Research Council (G0900805) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K006584/1) United Kingdom,https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/15914 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27492592 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01940963/document https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016NatSR...630797B/abstract https://www.nature.com/articles/srep30797.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/77041604 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01940963 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27492592/ https://www.nature.com/articles/srep30797 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/27492592 https://core.ac.uk/download/77041604.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep30797,27492592,10.1038/srep30797,2479907800,PMC4974614,0,003-126-380-048-447; 003-148-032-419-149; 003-991-031-736-66X; 004-547-012-506-08X; 004-847-302-771-441; 006-300-937-188-982; 008-101-001-793-000; 008-657-803-155-100; 008-851-828-510-497; 010-307-628-397-12X; 010-644-561-424-361; 010-689-259-696-971; 011-790-493-260-167; 014-705-914-383-326; 016-317-412-084-164; 019-491-715-104-735; 020-981-590-096-272; 023-357-780-928-703; 024-353-232-784-022; 024-566-969-609-21X; 025-236-632-551-360; 025-350-078-647-734; 026-595-471-545-875; 028-407-122-468-72X; 031-913-463-844-623; 032-035-648-597-438; 032-414-867-317-15X; 033-815-360-991-843; 038-231-202-446-05X; 038-512-630-407-891; 040-608-633-495-266; 041-801-494-368-750; 042-957-787-690-310; 044-610-456-186-224; 044-980-517-696-42X; 045-755-003-370-081; 048-232-026-824-265; 050-643-871-662-118; 050-959-404-422-183; 051-191-034-788-751; 052-373-401-799-967; 053-192-514-232-944; 055-357-132-717-490; 055-773-434-541-26X; 057-943-557-036-775; 058-565-611-383-016; 060-806-215-035-155; 061-888-831-084-24X; 062-190-902-999-917; 062-627-887-429-412; 067-765-270-871-013; 069-293-158-676-891; 069-396-027-987-181; 076-113-102-010-428; 083-762-572-106-380; 086-623-774-642-834; 086-643-255-018-018; 086-917-036-297-788; 088-002-421-479-42X; 091-807-096-488-491; 094-579-796-304-400; 095-172-857-136-132; 096-590-596-789-060; 099-006-537-018-42X; 099-073-326-135-52X; 109-547-267-839-027; 111-699-960-634-278; 114-635-779-748-541; 116-575-384-110-712; 123-189-322-899-891; 170-087-411-333-600; 190-717-794-758-882,10
266,003-717-278-212-145,Border control in a healthcare setting is not in the public's best interests.,2017-06-12,2017,journal article,"Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",17413850; 17413842,Oxford University Press,United Kingdom,JL Potter,"Medical Research Council [grant number MR/M014517/1].The past decade has witnessed a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment and populism, culminating in Brexit and the election of US President Donald Trump. Accompanying the xenophobic rhetoric of the UK media, a string of government policies have impeded access to healthcare for those not born in the UK.1 These include: the introduction of the National Health Service (NHS) surcharge for non-European Economic Area migrants who wish to stay in the UK for 6 months or longer; the introduction of upfront charging, due to be extended to primary care in the near future; and reports of identity checks at the door. In January this year, a formalized process that allows NHS Digital to pass individual demographic data, including a person's last known address, to the Home Office Immigration Enforcement Team was published.2 When patients hand over personal details in a healthcare setting there is an assumption that the confidentiality of these data will be protected. From its roots in the Hippocratic Oath to the current General Medical Council (GMC) guidance, confidentiality has long been a cornerstone of good medical practice. Allowing the Home Office access to this private space, even if it is only to obtain someone's name, violates the trust that is fundamental to effective health service provision. Access to healthcare is a human right.3,4 Furthermore, barriers to accessing care increase individual morbidity and mortality and threaten public health. However, the government, alongside the post 9/11 securitization of borders, argues that because of the strain undocumented migrants place on public services, it is in the public's best interests to identify and potentially deport these people.5 Using tuberculosis (TB) as an example, I will outline how these measures, rather than being in the public's best interest, put their health at risk. What is more, the economic justification is weak. Setting out the arguments There is clear evidence that the threat of deportation deters people from seeking help when they are unwell.6,7 Even when data are kept confidential, and there is no data exchange between health services and immigration authorities, the simple process of having to provide identification documents is enough to deter people from accessing healthcare.8 For TB, the longer the delay in diagnosis, the more unwell the patient becomes;9 the more likely they are to die;10 and the greater the risk of transmission in the community.11 This can be extended to other infectious diseases.12 Whilst NHS TB treatment is free for all, regardless of immigration status, routes to diagnosis are circuitous and awareness of health rights amongst migrants is poor.7 Furthermore, both upfront charges and identity checks can act as a barrier to people who are eligible for free care but do not have the required documentary evidence—such as the UK-born homeless population. Epidemiological data gathered through health systems are vital to our understanding of the causes and distribution of disease in societies.13 Some infectious diseases, such as TB, must be notified to public health authorities under law so that prompt actions can be taken to limit the spread of infection and safeguard public health. If healthcare workers become concerned about the potential harm that data sharing might do to their patients, the integrity of these valuable data sets will be compromised. One of the key strategies for tackling TB in the UK involves a screening programme for latent TB infection. Eligible patients (non-UK-born individuals who have moved to the UK recently from countries with an incidence of TB > 40/100 000) are identified in primary care. If the population to be screened is deterred from registering with a GP then attempts to eliminate TB via reducing the reservoir of latent infection will most likely fail and the government's £10 million pound investment will have been wasted. This concern extends to other vital public health strategies such as immunization14 and cancer screening.15 Whilst undocumented migrants are chargeable for services in secondary care, they are eligible for ‘immediately necessary’ care in primary care or accident and emergency departments. Using an economic model to analyse costs, a report from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights suggests that providing ‘regular preventive care, as opposed to providing only emergency care, is cost-saving for healthcare systems’.16 Conclusion The evidence presented here demonstrates how policies that generate barriers to healthcare access threaten not just the health of the individual but that of society as a whole. However, I urge us to move beyond the evidence and, as Paul Farmer has written, ‘return to the concept of social justice, which once inspired public health’.4 The political fight over control of our borders must be kept out of the health arena. Only by working together and taking a stand against policies which allow health for some but not all will we achieve this.Medical Research Council [grant number MR/M014517/1]",39,2,219,220,Business; Health care; Control (management); MEDLINE; Best interests; Mass screening; Public relations; Health policy,,Emigration and Immigration/legislation & jurisprudence; Health Policy; Humans; Latent Tuberculosis/diagnosis; Mass Screening; Undocumented Immigrants; United Kingdom,,Medical Research Council (MR/M014517/1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28605764 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28605764 https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/39/2/219/3866869 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28605764/ https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article-pdf/39/2/219/17702538/fdx051.pdf http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/24103,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdx051,28605764,10.1093/pubmed/fdx051,2626957258,,0,007-526-882-304-269; 009-163-105-534-257; 013-748-413-123-431; 032-308-371-956-039; 032-487-306-716-49X; 035-442-851-091-990; 053-362-251-030-628; 054-905-393-303-411; 061-467-027-319-233; 073-868-039-919-546; 131-271-125-612-989,9

Evidence suggests critical illness patient subgroups may exist that benefit from targeted physical rehabilitation interventions that could improve their recovery trajectory. We aim to identify critical illness patient subgroups that respond to physical rehabilitation and map recovery trajectories according to physical function and quality of life outcomes. Additionally, the utilisation of healthcare resources will be examined for subgroups identified. Methods and analysis This is an individual participant data meta-analysis protocol. A systematic literature review was conducted for randomised controlled trials that delivered additional physical rehabilitation for patients with critical illness during their acute hospital stay, assessed chronic disease burden, with a minimum follow-up period of 3 months measuring performance-based physical function and health-related quality of life outcomes. From 2178 records retrieved in the systematic literature review, four eligible trials were identified by two independent reviewers. Principal investigators of eligible trials were invited to contribute their data to this individual participant data meta-analysis. Risk of bias will be assessed (Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials). Participant and trial characteristics, interventions and outcomes data of included studies will be summarised. Meta-analyses will entail a one-stage model, which will account for the heterogeneity across and the clustering between studies. Multiple imputation using chained equations will be used to account for the missing data. Ethics and dissemination This individual participant data meta-analysis does not require ethical review as anonymised participant data will be used and no new data collected. Additionally, eligible trials were granted approval by institutional review boards or research ethics committees and informed consent was provided for participants. Data sharing agreements are in place permitting contribution of data. The study findings will be disseminated at conferences and through peer-reviewed publications.

Dove; Yaffa R. Rubinstein; Hugh Dawkins; Anna Kole; Pauline McCormack; Simon Woods; Olaf Riess; Franz Schaefer; Hanns Lochmüller; Bartha Maria Knoppers; Mats G. Hansson,"There is a growing international agreement on the need to provide greater access to research data and bio-specimen collections to optimize their long-term value and exploit their potential for health discovery and validation. This is especially evident for rare disease research. Currently, the rising value of data and bio-specimen collections does not correspond with an equal increase in data/sample-sharing and data/sample access. Contradictory legal and ethical frameworks across national borders are obstacles to effective sharing: more specifically, the absence of an integrated model proves to be a major logistical obstruction. The Charter intends to amend the obstacle by providing both the ethical foundations on which data sharing should be based, as well as a general Material and Data Transfer Agreement (MTA/DTA). This Charter is the result of a careful negotiation of different stakeholders' interest and is built on earlier consensus documents and position statements, which provided the general international legal framework. Further to this, the Charter provides tools that may help accelerate sharing. The Charter has been formulated to serve as an enabling tool for effective and transparent data and bio-specimen sharing and the general MTA/DTA constitutes a mechanism to ensure uniformity of access across projects and countries, and may be regarded as a consistent basic agreement for addressing data and material sharing globally. The Charter is forward looking in terms of emerging issues from the perspective of a multi-stakeholder group, and where possible, provides strategies that may address these issues.",23,6,721,728,Business; Exploit; Negotiation; Value (ethics); Obstacle; Charter; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Sample (statistics); Knowledge management,,Biological Specimen Banks/legislation & jurisprudence; Contracts; Europe; Information Dissemination/ethics; International Cooperation/legislation & jurisprudence,,Medical Research Council (MR/K000608/1) United Kingdom,https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/international-charter-of-principles-for-sharing-bio-specimens-and https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward_Dove/publication/266085358_International_Charter_of_principles_for_sharing_bio-specimens_and_data/links/558d6a8108ae15962d893780.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2014197 http://www.iss.it/binary/hibp/cont/EuropeanJHumanGenetics.pdf https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/65427 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27307116/ https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2014197.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27307116 https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/41914 https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/26957/ https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/206918 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/27307116 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:791288 http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:791288/FULLTEXT01.pdf http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:791288/FULLTEXT01,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ejhg.2014.197,25248399,10.1038/ejhg.2014.197,2076005227,PMC4795058,0,002-637-506-591-946; 005-969-320-324-014; 006-030-716-325-851; 013-132-720-839-514; 017-332-092-657-286; 019-538-368-158-59X; 021-634-645-906-237; 023-556-781-142-560; 024-169-216-614-605; 025-456-891-173-338; 032-372-220-884-53X; 039-507-873-188-515; 041-776-776-266-566; 043-517-053-250-92X; 045-236-610-023-378; 045-447-709-371-663; 049-660-434-829-003; 054-802-336-000-869; 055-439-851-374-761; 057-862-248-604-682; 065-042-982-606-048; 065-958-273-215-976; 075-465-734-221-082; 097-180-068-382-19X; 111-176-174-868-090; 123-686-430-945-848; 124-693-205-839-629; 132-894-596-984-663; 135-041-703-538-816; 155-902-760-527-758; 186-670-491-897-885,102

Cooper,"Many genetic causes of developmental delay and/or intellectual disability (DD/ID) are extremely rare, and robust discovery of these requires both large-scale DNA sequencing and data sharing. Here we describe a GeneMatcher collaboration which led to a cohort of 13 affected individuals harboring protein-altering variants, 11 of which are de novo, in MED13; the only inherited variant was transmitted to an affected child from an affected mother. All patients had intellectual disability and/or developmental delays, including speech delays or disorders. Other features that were reported in two or more patients include autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, optic nerve abnormalities, Duane anomaly, hypotonia, mild congenital heart abnormalities, and dysmorphisms. Six affected individuals had mutations that are predicted to truncate the MED13 protein, six had missense mutations, and one had an in-frame-deletion of one amino acid. Out of the seven non-truncating mutations, six clustered in two specific locations of the MED13 protein: an N-terminal and C-terminal region. The four N-terminal clustering mutations affect two adjacent amino acids that are known to be involved in MED13 ubiquitination and degradation, p.Thr326 and p.Pro327. MED13 is a component of the CDK8-kinase module that can reversibly bind Mediator, a multi-protein complex that is required for Polymerase II transcription initiation. Mutations in several other genes encoding subunits of Mediator have been previously shown to associate with DD/ID, including MED13L, a paralog of MED13. Thus, our findings add MED13 to the group of CDK8-kinase module-associated disease genes.",137,5,375,388,Gene; Autism spectrum disorder; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Hypotonia; Heart malformation; Human genetics; Genetics; Intellectual disability; Missense mutation; Biology,,"Adult; Amino Acid Sequence; Child; Child, Preschool; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8/genetics; Female; Humans; Male; Mediator Complex/genetics; Mutation, Missense; Neurodevelopmental Disorders/genetics; Sequence Deletion; Transcription Initiation, Genetic; Ubiquitination/genetics; United Kingdom","MED13 protein, human; MED13L protein, human; Mediator Complex; CDK8 protein, human; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8",NIEHS NIH HHS (K01 ES025435) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U01 HG007301) United States; National Human Genome Research Institute (UM1HG007301); Health Innovation Challenge Fund (HICF-1009-003); Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (Gravitation Grant 24.001.006); Wellcome Trust (WT098051) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00439-018-1887-y https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/191896 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00439-018-1887-y.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5973976 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29740699 https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/item/item_2586344_7/component/file_2603027/SnijdersBlok2018_Article_DeNovoMutationsInMED13ACompone.pdf https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29740699 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Acris.maastrichtuniversity.nl%3Apublications%2F3fe73f55-d30c-428d-b6dc-85e81a8a9866 https://khepri-node.dev.meta-infra.org/papers/de-novo-mutations-in-med13-a-component-of-the/29740699 https://core.ac.uk/display/159754572 https://knowledgeconnection.mainehealth.org/mmc/1674/ https://core.ac.uk/download/159754572.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00439-018-1887-y,29740699,10.1007/s00439-018-1887-y,2800384860,PMC5973976,0,000-299-742-465-317; 000-745-126-035-898; 002-747-756-323-765; 005-611-370-997-675; 006-376-492-449-510; 007-682-466-389-034; 008-821-218-976-225; 008-912-145-720-985; 008-930-024-186-439; 009-995-008-408-883; 011-390-745-373-377; 011-988-498-756-448; 021-343-413-124-033; 022-246-775-410-004; 027-962-030-524-698; 030-265-178-906-320; 030-873-238-865-41X; 034-889-237-805-767; 037-581-086-116-929; 039-245-218-272-457; 040-135-741-316-897; 041-167-695-675-014; 041-449-960-922-465; 042-321-935-447-029; 044-177-263-305-106; 044-518-451-045-295; 045-034-571-427-12X; 048-758-579-692-174; 059-202-574-741-323; 059-785-469-670-583; 060-285-586-460-432; 061-072-107-507-377; 062-485-958-386-114; 065-364-696-549-136; 065-525-077-824-631; 070-467-651-005-787; 076-167-148-813-270; 076-611-466-711-868; 078-128-982-656-458; 079-852-938-265-998; 087-479-100-871-756; 088-540-600-170-741; 097-437-576-421-651; 102-284-527-922-77X; 107-348-206-584-177; 126-368-122-664-759; 127-016-670-476-238; 129-384-859-362-21X; 130-121-617-100-285; 145-906-894-303-667; 168-368-524-038-981,29

Halliday; Andrew J. Millar,"A key step in the analysis of circadian data is to make an accurate estimate of the underlying period. There are many different techniques and algorithms for determining period, all with different assumptions and with differing levels of complexity. Choosing which algorithm, which implementation and which measures of accuracy to use can offer many pitfalls, especially for the non-expert. We have developed the BioDare system, an online service allowing data-sharing (including public dissemination), data-processing and analysis. Circadian experiments are the main focus of BioDare hence performing period analysis is a major feature of the system. Six methods have been incorporated into BioDare: Enright and Lomb-Scargle periodograms, FFT-NLLS, mFourfit, MESA and Spectrum Resampling. Here we review those six techniques, explain the principles behind each algorithm and evaluate their performance. In order to quantify the methods' accuracy, we examine the algorithms against artificial mathematical test signals and model-generated mRNA data. Our re-implementation of each method in Java allows meaningful comparisons of the computational complexity and computing time associated with each algorithm. Finally, we provide guidelines on which algorithms are most appropriate for which data types, and recommendations on experimental design to extract optimal data for analysis.",9,5,e96462,,Machine learning; Data processing; Data type; Resampling; Time series; Artificial intelligence; Data management; Computational complexity theory; Key (cryptography); Feature (machine learning); Bioinformatics; Biology,,"Algorithms; Circadian Rhythm/physiology; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Periodicity",,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/D019621/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/F005237/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/F005237) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/D019621) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/J009423) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/F005296/1) United Kingdom,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PLoSO...996462Z/abstract https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24809473 https://core.ac.uk/display/28977548 https://paperity.org/p/60422990/strengths-and-limitations-of-period-estimation-methods-for-circadian-data https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4014635/ https://doaj.org/article/7e7989542dd942ed95f33b0efa1e4878 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24809473 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/15466174/journal.pone.0096462.pdf https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096462 http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/strengths-and-limitations-of-period-estimation-methods-for-circadian-data(74f0ffe4-ccab-45b1-af92-635c14c22c52).html https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096462 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/strengths-and-limitations-of-period-estimation-methods-for-circadian-data(74f0ffe4-ccab-45b1-af92-635c14c22c52)/export.html https://core.ac.uk/download/28977548.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096462,24809473,10.1371/journal.pone.0096462,2042167665,PMC4014635,0,003-934-507-805-421; 005-522-943-176-782; 006-535-762-565-171; 007-484-610-089-11X; 008-811-889-877-915; 008-984-460-986-364; 009-547-197-683-761; 011-104-753-371-38X; 011-878-802-344-476; 021-142-533-182-843; 021-782-887-883-933; 023-005-123-946-718; 027-619-922-986-62X; 031-161-409-412-564; 031-430-554-783-938; 031-687-632-281-786; 035-754-723-817-913; 036-728-121-511-172; 037-101-767-015-917; 037-341-699-408-569; 043-667-632-154-370; 050-570-163-140-47X; 051-587-996-823-766; 059-136-274-594-146; 066-661-130-937-911; 072-068-444-091-20X; 073-722-190-111-134; 077-448-700-626-514; 079-894-858-780-645; 082-406-031-823-240; 086-766-851-383-417; 089-956-785-003-848; 090-301-325-172-032; 093-441-025-653-970; 095-676-303-083-218; 095-833-348-098-516; 099-837-349-416-487; 104-513-234-352-709; 106-783-461-335-207; 106-962-752-011-388; 109-913-184-560-191; 110-432-169-908-346; 111-303-482-572-004; 119-644-220-580-617; 129-454-052-938-215; 135-564-348-130-957; 156-816-415-149-771; 158-422-900-990-24X,166

This increased awareness has led to the realisation that existing legislation and regulation provides insufficient protection to individuals, groups, society, and the environment from AI harms. In response to this realisation, there has been a proliferation of principle-based ethics codes, guidelines and frameworks. However, it has become increasingly clear that a significant gap exists between the theory of AI ethics principles and the practical design of AI systems. In previous work, we analysed whether it is possible to close this gap between the ‘what’ and the ‘how’ of AI ethics through the use of tools and methods designed to help AI developers, engineers, and designers translate principles into practice. We concluded that this method of closure is currently ineffective as almost all existing translational tools and methods are either too flexible (and thus vulnerable to ethics washing) or too strict (unresponsive to context). This raised the question: if, even with technical guidance, AI ethics is challenging to embed in the process of algorithmic design, is the entire pro-ethical design endeavour rendered futile? And, if no, then how can AI ethics be made useful for AI practitioners? This is the question we seek to address here by exploring why principles and technical translational tools are still needed even if they are limited, and how these limitations can be potentially overcome by providing theoretical grounding of a concept that has been termed ‘Ethics as a Service.’",31,2,239,256,Business ethics; Closure (psychology); Legislation; Realisation; Context (language use); Service (systems architecture); Computer science; Process (engineering); Engineering ethics; Applied ethics,Applied ethics; Artificial Intelligence; Business ethics; Data ethics; Machine learning,,,Digital Catapult; Wellcome Trust,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2102.html#abs-2102-09364 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-021-09563-w https://philpapers.org/rec/MOREAA-18 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8550007 https://doi.org/10.1007/s11023-021-09563-w https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09364 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11023-021-09563-w.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09364,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11023-021-09563-w,34720418,10.1007/s11023-021-09563-w,3175297548,PMC8550007,0,000-711-422-372-922; 003-376-741-403-048; 005-960-359-438-034; 006-841-324-964-274; 007-402-375-456-490; 008-334-767-049-944; 010-080-114-914-00X; 015-104-603-173-99X; 017-355-214-052-94X; 019-041-386-067-401; 019-927-458-745-316; 021-871-270-907-637; 021-921-179-406-236; 026-980-570-150-300; 027-809-723-164-68X; 028-105-022-143-617; 028-257-651-127-735; 028-677-897-431-463; 037-658-231-717-847; 038-704-825-176-807; 042-816-707-154-771; 043-863-456-195-613; 043-877-426-516-41X; 048-201-560-991-15X; 053-557-719-817-646; 054-076-127-876-561; 056-893-737-083-078; 061-252-231-596-205; 071-413-130-992-767; 071-770-619-396-675; 073-270-475-032-988; 076-971-426-558-490; 078-101-702-873-838; 081-022-651-291-987; 085-789-835-198-719; 095-423-269-130-774; 099-766-981-018-583; 099-850-693-043-022; 105-356-751-715-15X; 106-712-652-032-948; 107-181-866-783-380; 109-901-599-216-167; 116-057-853-146-778; 116-393-158-701-648; 118-871-066-690-546; 120-554-951-037-681; 120-727-604-481-131; 130-914-953-234-311; 135-620-256-694-839; 144-613-171-506-852; 150-120-864-451-69X; 158-079-116-800-566; 168-108-621-947-22X; 173-718-377-832-672; 181-972-042-826-442,3

Penland; Weifeng Tang,"Aims To assess the dapagliflozin exposure-response relationship in Japanese and non-Japanese patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and investigate if a dose adjustment is required in Japanese patients. Materials and methods Data from two clinical studies were used to develop a non-linear mixed effects model describing the relationship between dapagliflozin exposure (area under the concentration curve) and response (24-hour urinary glucose excretion [UGE]) in Japanese and non-Japanese patients with T1DM. The effects of patient-level characteristics (covariates; identified using a stepwise procedure) on response was also assessed. Simulations were performed using median-normalized covariate values. Results Data from 84 patients were included. Average self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) at day 7, change from baseline in total insulin dose at day 7, and baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) all had a significant effect on 24-hours UGE, with SMBG being the most influential. Dapagliflozin systemic exposure for matching doses and baseline eGFR was similar between Japanese and non-Japanese patients; however, higher SMBG and a greater reduction in total insulin dose was observed in the Japanese population. When the significant covariates were included, the model fit the data well for both populations, and accurately predicted exposure-response in the Japanese and non-Japanese populations, in agreement with the observed data. Conclusions There was no difference in dapagliflozin exposure-response in Japanese and non-Japanese patients with T1DM once differences in renal function, glycaemic control and insulin dose reductions between studies were considered. Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended in Japanese patients with T1DM.",21,4,829,836,Excretion; Urology; Renal function; Dapagliflozin; Type 1 diabetes; SGLT2 Inhibitor; Dose adjustment; Exposure response; Medicine; Urinary system,SGLT2 inhibitor; dapagliflozin; exposure-response relationship; type 1 diabetes mellitus,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asians; Benzhydryl Compounds/administration & dosage; Blood Glucose/metabolism; Computer Simulation; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/drug therapy; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Glucosides/administration & dosage; Glycosuria/urine; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/administration & dosage; Insulin/administration & dosage; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Renal Elimination; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors/administration & dosage; United States; Young Adult",Benzhydryl Compounds; Blood Glucose; Glucosides; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; dapagliflozin,AstraZeneca,https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dom.13586 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dom.13586 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6590404 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30456904 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30456904/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dom.13586,30456904,10.1111/dom.13586,2900532906,PMC6590404,0,004-337-994-677-324; 004-491-162-772-519; 008-358-920-045-226; 009-950-826-686-050; 014-533-836-038-958; 018-341-390-054-345; 018-745-595-224-994; 024-993-153-200-75X; 027-340-293-184-57X; 036-629-087-752-314; 049-103-651-269-178; 050-754-331-527-144; 070-607-796-995-242; 073-865-261-101-880; 074-815-092-309-795; 078-852-365-790-798; 081-700-912-001-897; 115-898-628-196-63X; 118-469-025-159-550; 124-671-659-262-783,5

Madoff; Britta Lassmann,"Infectious disease outbreaks play an important role in global morbidity and mortality. Real-time epidemic forecasting provides an opportunity to predict geographic disease spread as well as case counts to better inform public health interventions when outbreaks occur. Challenges and recent advances in predictive modeling are discussed here. We identified data needs in the areas of epidemic surveillance, mobility, host and environmental susceptibility, pathogen transmissibility, population density, and healthcare capacity. Constraints in standardized case definitions and timely data sharing can limit the precision of predictive models. Resource-limited settings present particular challenges for accurate epidemic forecasting due to the lack of granular data available. Incorporating novel data streams into modeling efforts is an important consideration for the future as technology penetration continues to improve on a global level. Recent advances in machine-learning, increased collaboration between modelers, the use of stochastic semi-mechanistic models, real-time digital disease surveillance data, and open data sharing provide opportunities for refining forecasts for future epidemics. Epidemic forecasting using predictive modeling is an important tool for outbreak preparedness and response efforts. Despite the presence of some data gaps at present, opportunities and advancements in innovative data streams provide additional support for modeling future epidemics.",17,4,268,275,Risk analysis (engineering); Outbreak; Health care; Disease surveillance; Preparedness; Data sharing; Open data; Computer science; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Data stream mining,Disease modeling; Epidemic management/response; Infectious diseases; Surveillance,"Data Collection; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Forecasting; Humans; Machine Learning; Models, Statistical; Population Surveillance; Public Health",,Medical Research Council (MR/R015600/1) United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31433279/ https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/hs.2019.0022 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6708259/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6708259,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/hs.2019.0022,31433279,10.1089/hs.2019.0022,2969810948,PMC6708259,0,002-698-249-653-26X; 002-786-502-503-821; 003-383-325-452-540; 010-599-093-585-999; 011-165-350-917-658; 013-445-607-841-054; 013-532-951-566-018; 016-544-673-036-355; 016-574-855-358-571; 024-931-875-394-660; 027-705-664-743-203; 031-510-576-861-781; 034-456-148-741-825; 043-680-436-465-362; 045-079-721-119-827; 046-624-291-791-863; 049-843-022-228-780; 058-016-535-852-543; 062-487-345-898-052; 076-379-034-807-192; 080-429-443-811-966; 110-061-736-926-373; 120-171-787-308-807; 121-153-745-124-230,46

Barr; Maria Zambon,"The non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 have had consequences on the transmission of other respiratory viruses, most notably paediatric respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. At the beginning of 2020, lockdown measures in the southern hemisphere led to a winter season with a marked reduction in both infections. Intermittent lockdowns in the northern hemisphere also appeared to interrupt transmission during winter 2020/21. However, a number of southern and northern hemisphere countries have now seen delayed RSV peaks. We examine the implications of these unpredictable disease dynamics for health service delivery in Europe, such as paediatric hospital and intensive care bed space planning, or palivizumab prophylaxis. We discuss the challenges for RSV vaccine trials and influenza immunisation campaigns, and highlight the considerable research opportunities that have arisen with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Anderson; Silvano Adami; Jonathan D. Adachi; Glow Investigators,"Low body mass index (BMI) is a well-established risk factor for fracture in postmenopausal women. Height and obesity have also been associated with increased fracture risk at some sites. We investigated the relationships of weight, BMI, and height with incident clinical fracture in a practice-based cohort of postmenopausal women participating in the Global Longitudinal study of Osteoporosis in Women (GLOW). Data were collected at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 years. For hip, spine, wrist, pelvis, rib, upper arm/shoulder, clavicle, ankle, lower leg, and upper leg fractures, we modeled the time to incident self-reported fracture over a 3-year period using the Cox proportional hazards model and fitted the best linear or nonlinear models containing height, weight, and BMI. Of 52,939 women, 3628 (6.9%) reported an incident clinical fracture during the 3-year follow-up period. Linear BMI showed a significant inverse association with hip, clinical spine, and wrist fractures: adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) per increase of 5 kg/m(2) were 0.80 (0.71-0.90), 0.83 (0.76-0.92), and 0.88 (0.83-0.94), respectively (all p < 0.001). For ankle fractures, linear weight showed a significant positive association: adjusted HR per 5-kg increase 1.05 (1.02-1.07) (p < 0.001). For upper arm/shoulder and clavicle fractures, only linear height was significantly associated: adjusted HRs per 10-cm increase were 0.85 (0.75-0.97) (p = 0.02) and 0.73 (0.57-0.92) (p = 0.009), respectively. For pelvic and rib fractures, the best models were for nonlinear BMI or weight (p = 0.05 and 0.03, respectively), with inverse associations at low BMI/body weight and positive associations at high values. These data demonstrate that the relationships between fracture and weight, BMI, and height are site-specific. The different associations may be mediated, at least in part, by effects on bone mineral density, bone structure and geometry, and patterns of falling.",29,2,487,493,Surgery; Dentistry; Hazard ratio; Osteoporosis; Bone mineral; Ankle; Body mass index; Confidence interval; Proportional hazards model; Risk factor; Medicine,BMI; FRACTURES; OBESITY; OSTEOPOROSIS; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,"Age Factors; Aged; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Bone and Bones/metabolism; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Fractures, Bone/epidemiology; Humans; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Postmenopause/metabolism; Risk Factors",,Medical Research Council (MC_U147585824) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UP_A620_1014) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12011/1) United Kingdom; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG024827) United States,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jbmr.2051 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jbmr.2051 https://iris.univr.it/handle/11562/623959 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.atira.dk%3Apublications%2F86d3b155-a280-4c11-9922-8ea8771a34e8 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/362787/ http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23873741 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3nz282wv https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/cor_glow/16/ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbmr.2051/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4878680/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23873741/ https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/publications/448832 https://asbmr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jbmr.2051 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4878680/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jbmr.2051,23873741,10.1002/jbmr.2051,1572510157,PMC4878680,1,000-241-551-145-749; 001-239-287-703-847; 004-556-134-286-323; 004-640-236-570-474; 005-262-676-549-979; 008-959-487-598-690; 010-978-675-524-483; 013-191-601-784-987; 013-308-198-147-668; 013-335-403-377-707; 014-438-458-570-676; 017-814-883-127-996; 018-773-845-852-757; 019-751-398-981-301; 022-178-072-662-529; 023-838-208-787-521; 024-435-186-222-633; 025-197-423-774-497; 033-525-515-107-544; 034-638-756-724-057; 034-959-791-162-683; 035-652-853-892-463; 036-097-815-881-954; 040-893-384-157-156; 041-009-646-342-869; 042-846-854-622-149; 045-278-981-641-808; 051-743-823-624-55X; 052-038-707-101-869; 052-720-304-641-272; 057-559-870-094-465; 065-034-616-020-565; 068-507-274-556-787; 071-920-694-240-25X; 076-737-081-927-610; 076-857-077-319-870; 085-131-787-461-461; 089-214-726-989-392; 089-883-078-210-050; 090-827-224-074-480; 092-170-634-541-343; 098-579-712-585-133; 102-879-835-772-665; 130-449-402-634-377; 130-474-269-090-351; 145-251-696-977-703,154

We aim to develop a prognostic tool for identifying patients at high risk of asthma attacks in primary care by leveraging advances in machine learning. Methods and analysis Current prognostic tools use logistic regression to develop a risk scoring model for asthma attacks. We propose to build on this by systematically applying various well-known machine learning techniques to a large longitudinal deidentified primary care database, the Optimum Patient Care Research Database, and comparatively evaluate their performance with the existing logistic regression model and against each other. Machine learning algorithms vary in their predictive abilities based on the dataset and the approach to analysis employed. We will undertake feature selection, classification (both one-class and two-class classifiers) and performance evaluation. Patients who have had actively treated clinician-diagnosed asthma, aged 8–80 years and with 3 years of continuous data, from 2016 to 2018, will be selected. Risk factors will be obtained from the first year, while the next 2 years will form the outcome period, in which the primary endpoint will be the occurrence of an asthma attack.

This paper aims to assess compliance with the restrictions and identify attempts to continue to market tobacco products and perpetuate misperceptions of harm post legislation. Design, setting and intervention A prospective study of the introduction of standardised packaging of tobacco products to the UK. Participants and outcomes We analysed commercial sales data to assess whether the legally required changes in pack branding, size and name were implemented. To explore any adaptations to products and packaging we analysed sales data, monthly pack purchases of factory-made (FM) cigarettes and roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco, tobacco advertisements from retail trade magazines and articles on tobacco from commercial literature (retail trade, market analyst and tobacco company publications). Results One month after full implementation of the UK and European Union policies, 97% FM and 98% RYO was sold in compliant packaging. Nevertheless, tobacco companies made adaptations to tobacco products which enabled continued brand differentiation after the legislation came into force. For example, flavour names previously associated with low tar were systematically changed to colour names arguably facilitating continued misperceptions about the relative harms of products. Tobacco companies used the 1-year sell-through to their advantage by communicating brand name changes and providing financial incentives for retailers to buy large volumes of branded packs. In addition, tobacco companies continued to market their products to retailers and customers by innovating exemptions to the legislation, namely, filters, packaging edges, seals, multipack outers, RYO accessories, cigars and pipe tobacco. Conclusions Tobacco companies adapted to packaging restrictions by innovating their tobacco products and marketing activities. These findings should enable policy makers globally to close loopholes and increase the potential efficacy of standardised packaging policies.",9,9,1,11,Marketing; Market analysis; Legislation; Directive; Tobacco industry; Tobacco pipe; European union; Product (business); Intervention (law); Medicine,plain packs; standardised packaging; tobacco; tobacco industry,Commerce/legislation & jurisprudence; Longitudinal Studies; Marketing/methods; Product Packaging/legislation & jurisprudence; Prospective Studies; Tobacco Industry/legislation & jurisprudence; Tobacco Products/legislation & jurisprudence; United Kingdom,,Cancer Research UK (C27260/A23168) United Kingdom; British Heart Foundation United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K023195/1) United Kingdom,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/9/e028506.abstract?ct= https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31551373 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/9/e028506.full.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31551373/ https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/prospective-longitudinal-study-of-tobacco-company-adaptation-to-s https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/9/e028506 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551373,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028506,31551373,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-028506,2976062187,PMC6773294,0,004-084-709-331-445; 010-806-369-812-371; 011-779-261-285-667; 020-322-433-034-60X; 021-498-457-153-940; 024-469-428-037-998; 031-268-534-281-831; 036-176-041-316-745; 037-406-582-054-589; 041-688-402-953-345; 042-160-476-333-924; 051-561-225-654-575; 051-874-029-653-871; 058-519-044-829-781; 063-771-625-867-343; 093-813-075-382-800; 111-184-373-113-942; 111-349-008-407-777; 117-422-860-914-236; 123-826-443-877-962; 126-094-983-707-487; 133-363-895-943-187; 146-899-900-554-096; 152-946-315-098-794,16

The case for bringing together large amounts of image data from well-characterised healthy subjects and those with a range of common brain diseases across the life course is now compelling. This report follows a meeting of international experts from multiple disciplines, all interested in brain image biobanking. The meeting included neuroimaging experts (clinical and non-clinical), computer scientists, epidemiologists, clinicians, ethicists, and lawyers involved in creating brain image banks. The meeting followed a structured format to discuss current and emerging brain image banks; applications such as atlases; conceptual and statistical problems (e.g. defining 'normality'); legal, ethical and technological issues (e.g. consents, potential for data linkage, data security, harmonisation, data storage and enabling of research data sharing). We summarise the lessons learned from the experiences of a wide range of individual image banks, and provide practical recommendations to enhance creation, use and reuse of neuroimaging data. Our aim is to maximise the benefit of the image data, provided voluntarily by research participants and funded by many organisations, for human health. Our ultimate vision is of a federated network of brain image biobanks accessible for large studies of brain structure and function.",153,,399,409,Data security; Biobank; Life course approach; Multidisciplinary approach; Data science; Brain Structure and Function; Data sharing; Healthy subjects; Management science; Neuroimaging; Medicine,Brain image biobank; Data sharing; Neuroimaging,"Database Management Systems; Databases, Factual; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Information Storage and Retrieval; Neuroimaging",,NIBIB NIH HHS (P41 EB015922) United States; NIA NIH HHS (RF1 AG041915) United States; Medical Research Council (MR/M024903/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K026992/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G9409634) United Kingdom; NIBIB NIH HHS (U54 EB020403) United States; Medical Research Council (G0701120) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/N003403/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (100309/Z/12/Z) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M009106/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0701127) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_PC_17114) United Kingdom,https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/improving-data-availability-for-brain-image-biobanking-in-healthy https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28232121/ http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/186776/ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.02.030 https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/682348 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage153.html#ShenkinPNPMLMLM17 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/improving-data-availability-for-brain-image-biobanking-in-healthy-subjects-practicebased-suggestions-from-an-international-multidisciplinary-working-group(6d170be6-73ef-4946-bfda-fd64e1a872e1)/export.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28232121 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/31305964/1_s2.0_S1053811917301416_main.pdf https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/682348 https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/publications/682348 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01496342 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28232121 https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/publications/682348 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/98253 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5798604 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1566555/ https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01496342/document https://core.ac.uk/display/154414323 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/682348 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811917301416 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepub.eur.nl%3A98253 https://core.ac.uk/download/322479310.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.02.030,28232121,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.02.030,2588414084,PMC5798604,0,000-199-206-963-760; 000-807-288-268-732; 002-009-406-588-507; 002-547-341-418-715; 004-603-175-044-557; 004-606-768-942-348; 006-434-140-087-870; 006-565-786-489-81X; 006-675-164-480-973; 006-869-036-635-593; 008-081-401-770-101; 008-989-867-184-42X; 011-702-569-343-864; 011-833-525-323-212; 011-913-292-404-272; 012-184-532-439-298; 012-379-257-867-633; 013-321-476-911-707; 013-506-941-699-897; 013-549-812-638-473; 013-955-549-534-493; 014-050-827-791-765; 014-960-977-747-519; 015-162-975-636-049; 015-480-663-572-473; 015-753-913-218-719; 016-223-205-834-041; 016-237-096-150-851; 017-609-840-319-506; 018-972-413-519-557; 020-042-058-400-949; 020-545-229-948-795; 022-607-536-600-207; 024-435-790-872-982; 024-952-954-438-978; 025-720-392-069-341; 027-342-997-443-831; 030-478-757-760-003; 033-032-187-028-437; 034-770-970-200-64X; 034-871-335-869-275; 035-279-487-600-594; 036-252-630-279-534; 036-619-602-757-226; 036-736-413-728-699; 037-804-309-944-891; 038-763-735-508-783; 041-135-477-578-260; 042-084-701-327-490; 043-363-355-681-347; 044-287-109-446-709; 045-486-637-599-598; 047-528-922-085-153; 050-482-133-724-204; 050-549-525-823-221; 051-656-354-460-584; 052-425-025-955-058; 052-488-126-035-363; 053-150-125-815-614; 055-440-153-775-021; 057-390-865-016-584; 059-226-225-741-41X; 060-074-290-193-048; 061-291-248-631-101; 063-770-535-464-722; 063-967-258-316-973; 069-055-013-587-210; 069-841-009-097-022; 074-262-380-832-380; 075-695-570-044-676; 077-314-538-863-787; 079-243-524-744-565; 081-229-879-031-004; 090-420-653-439-754; 093-819-912-295-892; 094-894-300-540-144; 096-141-845-715-529; 100-700-729-325-84X; 102-670-947-124-753; 113-975-826-791-740; 117-242-680-122-567; 123-958-152-397-939; 126-525-901-142-905; 126-780-381-196-544; 140-830-367-735-505; 153-922-688-037-054,12

Salek; Steffen Neumann; Andrew R. Jones,"Mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the primary techniques used for large-scale analysis of small molecules in metabolomics studies. To date, there has been little data format standardization in this field, as different software packages export results in different formats represented in XML or plain text, making data sharing, database deposition, and reanalysis highly challenging. Working within the consortia of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative, Proteomics Standards Initiative, and the Metabolomics Society, we have created mzTab-M to act as a common output format from analytical approaches using MS on small molecules. The format has been developed over several years, with input from a wide range of stakeholders. mzTab-M is a simple tab-separated text format, but importantly, the structure is highly standardized through the design of a detailed specification document, tightly coupled to validation software, and a mandatory controlled vocabulary of terms to populate it. The format is able to represent final quantification values from analyses, as well as the evidence trail in terms of features measured directly from MS (e.g., LC-MS, GC-MS, DIMS, etc.) and different types of approaches used to identify molecules. mzTab-M allows for ambiguity in the identification of molecules to be communicated clearly to readers of the files (both people and software). There are several implementations of the format available, and we anticipate widespread adoption in the field.",91,5,3302,3310,Chemistry; Standardization; Information retrieval; Proteomics Standards Initiative; Data sharing; Plain text; Identification (information); XML; Formatted text; File format,,"Databases, Factual; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics/methods; Software",,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/M020282/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000771/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/K01997X/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/E025080/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/L024128/1) United Kingdom; NIGMS NIH HHS (R24 GM127667) United States,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30688441/ https://unipub.uni-graz.at/obvugrfodok/content/titleinfo/5834399?lang=en https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3033737/ https://bibliographie.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/100410 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6316418 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04310 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04310?src=recsys https://figshare.com/collections/mzTab-M_A_Data_Standard_for_Sharing_Quantitative_Results_in_Mass_Spectrometry_Metabolomics/4398566 https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/100410 https://graz.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/mztab-m-a-data-standard-for-sharing-quantitative-results-in-mass- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6660005 https://core.ac.uk/download/222792485.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04310,30688441,10.1021/acs.analchem.8b04310,2913028692,PMC6660005,0,000-737-855-307-38X; 001-724-833-860-436; 004-678-699-918-522; 007-661-635-121-360; 008-746-097-946-080; 011-547-067-492-90X; 012-770-059-004-038; 016-273-291-086-400; 016-566-535-787-756; 019-018-042-761-058; 021-376-102-143-203; 021-467-715-764-655; 021-965-942-944-092; 022-526-129-975-007; 023-315-513-687-671; 026-366-970-826-664; 031-990-926-958-360; 037-212-919-082-775; 040-472-471-845-971; 045-361-758-943-165; 049-012-654-002-459; 049-698-939-529-843; 051-548-594-606-353; 054-040-525-317-867; 056-552-829-431-53X; 056-790-779-670-48X; 058-425-654-816-948; 063-200-724-104-457; 067-824-037-829-713; 068-223-082-354-713; 070-462-022-251-464; 074-284-520-781-173; 083-477-107-025-224; 084-213-185-304-701; 098-016-413-464-72X; 125-747-231-124-608; 140-242-669-526-644; 151-618-495-710-215; 183-022-769-808-433,25

Barton; Roddy Walsh,"Genetic testing for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an established clinical technique, supported by 30 years of research into its genetic etiology. Although pathogenic variants are often detected in patients and used to identify at-risk relatives, the effectiveness of genetic testing has been hampered by ambiguous genetic associations (yielding uncertain and potentially false-positive results), difficulties in classifying variants, and uncertainty about genotype-negative patients. Recent case-control studies on rare variation, improved data sharing, and meta-analysis of case cohorts contributed to new insights into the genetic basis of HCM. In particular, although research into new genes and mechanisms remains essential, reassessment of Mendelian genetic associations in HCM argues that current clinical genetic testing should be limited to a small number of validated disease genes that yield informative and interpretable results. Accurate and consistent variant interpretation has benefited from new standardized variant interpretation guidelines and innovative approaches to improve classification. Most cases lacking a pathogenic variant are now believed to indicate non-Mendelian HCM, with more benign prognosis and minimal risk to relatives. Here, we discuss recent advances in the genetics of HCM and their application to clinical genetic testing together with practical issues regarding implementation. Although this review focuses on HCM, many of the issues discussed are also relevant to other inherited cardiac diseases.",9,8,0,0,Mendelian inheritance; Genetic association; Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Genetic testing; Disease gene; Genetic etiology; In patient; Clinical genetic; Genetics; Medicine,genetic association; genetic testing; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic/diagnosis; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Testing; Genetic Variation; Humans; Phenotype; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",,Department of Health United Kingdom,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.015473 https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.015473 https://flore.unifi.it/handle/2158/1194236 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2Fbb386719-2e9f-4368-98cd-52fafe3f4563 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7428545 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32306808 https://iris.unibs.it/handle/11379/545696?mode=full.1098 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7428545 https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.015473,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/jaha.119.015473,32306808,10.1161/jaha.119.015473,3017333828,PMC7428545,0,000-492-734-759-977; 000-717-476-454-306; 000-762-632-811-479; 000-973-212-371-980; 002-021-098-047-523; 002-044-821-059-972; 002-552-996-730-183; 002-799-945-203-660; 004-087-052-948-793; 004-732-404-891-559; 004-838-817-090-894; 005-377-674-977-777; 005-518-234-541-976; 006-059-783-217-913; 006-140-957-850-54X; 006-687-167-559-562; 007-133-883-085-910; 007-522-282-368-156; 008-520-914-506-631; 009-295-655-733-829; 009-319-831-733-144; 009-458-199-466-061; 009-977-142-156-462; 010-564-035-262-171; 010-565-125-292-141; 010-617-541-118-953; 010-635-713-938-093; 012-314-840-087-231; 012-387-393-625-444; 012-922-088-811-496; 013-023-192-120-051; 013-823-624-865-870; 013-965-140-491-773; 015-307-411-123-672; 016-390-947-487-841; 016-864-380-000-394; 017-824-157-458-984; 018-908-931-660-802; 019-091-659-381-662; 019-960-699-737-565; 020-145-056-523-963; 020-229-800-222-834; 020-958-762-890-355; 022-030-057-004-666; 022-634-211-378-672; 023-474-058-772-740; 024-153-217-086-22X; 026-496-588-020-761; 026-553-185-216-549; 027-586-334-428-64X; 028-467-284-590-474; 028-734-607-947-129; 029-010-876-360-425; 031-893-519-385-863; 032-321-971-529-598; 032-445-610-345-560; 033-496-623-158-365; 034-340-875-448-970; 034-964-211-457-60X; 036-708-717-657-190; 040-746-923-114-009; 046-485-913-624-529; 046-718-041-032-044; 049-110-230-748-555; 051-509-530-427-290; 052-098-325-011-459; 054-768-229-586-693; 054-916-609-067-379; 055-192-342-638-042; 055-517-740-043-135; 055-781-799-480-48X; 056-321-023-455-753; 056-322-731-748-682; 056-396-326-819-16X; 056-538-366-151-505; 056-548-858-728-859; 056-839-915-058-16X; 057-941-119-734-689; 058-405-026-334-317; 059-678-053-265-484; 059-831-145-484-156; 060-172-612-606-984; 061-920-672-578-935; 065-786-014-559-805; 065-872-906-538-306; 066-656-849-136-22X; 066-796-610-718-505; 066-800-373-112-727; 067-089-019-029-36X; 067-409-267-593-269; 067-708-825-335-003; 068-070-060-905-313; 068-428-011-551-604; 069-109-654-555-13X; 070-525-413-126-615; 071-316-611-367-634; 073-981-273-666-510; 075-161-117-865-197; 075-427-526-505-980; 076-407-698-109-237; 077-217-076-105-820; 080-756-836-305-640; 081-237-923-216-592; 081-250-845-859-248; 085-875-210-681-47X; 086-847-437-818-459; 087-253-166-237-289; 087-670-515-684-675; 090-445-300-916-026; 091-716-150-608-922; 092-130-054-078-165; 092-813-726-430-305; 093-430-294-211-552; 094-124-726-943-062; 096-008-000-717-028; 099-504-423-295-754; 100-391-398-400-350; 101-800-176-946-279; 101-913-842-085-919; 103-263-597-525-60X; 104-670-381-881-642; 104-902-170-821-789; 105-074-299-672-281; 105-365-688-796-456; 105-685-955-052-631; 106-840-282-923-837; 107-372-711-046-150; 107-966-592-707-486; 111-193-446-616-351; 117-417-456-926-458; 119-924-331-144-128; 121-809-545-400-615; 123-918-123-442-343; 125-451-933-842-003; 127-016-670-476-238; 127-586-092-245-52X; 128-211-643-908-461; 135-758-295-163-805; 151-458-525-404-455; 159-759-484-672-946; 166-258-785-640-399; 185-220-298-546-288,13

Methods This was a pragmatic, multicentre, three arm, parallel randomised controlled trial with simple randomisation. Treatment allocation was not blinded. Participants were adults with symptoms of depression (score ≥10 on nine item patient health questionnaire, PHQ-9) who were randomised to receive a commercially produced cCBT programme (“Beating the Blues”) or a free to use cCBT programme (MoodGYM) in addition to usual GP care. Participants were supported and encouraged to complete the programme via weekly telephone calls. Control participants were offered usual GP care, with no constraints on the range of treatments that could be accessed. The primary outcome was severity of depression assessed with the PHQ-9 at four months. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life (measured by SF-36) and psychological wellbeing (measured by CORE-OM) at four, 12, and 24 months and depression at 12 and 24 months. Study answer and limitations Participants offered commercial or free to use cCBT experienced no additional improvement in depression compared with usual GP care at four months (odds ratio 1.19 (95% confidence interval 0.75 to 1.88) for Beating the Blues v usual GP care; 0.98 (0.62 to 1.56) for MoodGYM v usual GP care). There was no evidence of an overall difference between either programme compared with usual GP care (0.99 (0.57 to 1.70) and 0.68 (0.42 to 1.10), respectively) at any time point. Commercially provided cCBT conferred no additional benefit over free to use cCBT or usual GP care at any follow-up point. Uptake and use of cCBT was low, despite regular telephone support. Nearly a quarter of participants (24%) had dropped out by four months. The study did not have enough power to detect small differences so these cannot be ruled out. Findings cannot be generalised to cCBT offered with a much higher level of guidance and support. What this study adds Supported cCBT does not substantially improve depression outcomes compared with usual GP care alone. In this study, neither a commercially available nor free to use computerised CBT intervention was superior to usual GP care.

Millar,"Synthetic biology aims to introduce engineering principles into biology, for example, the construction of biological devices by assembling previously-characterized, functional parts. This approach demands new resources for cataloging and sharing biological components and designs, in order to accelerate the design-build-test-learn cycle. We evaluated two free, open source software platforms for managing synthetic biology data: Joint Bioenergy Institute-Inventory of Composable Elements (JBEI-ICE) and SynBioHub. We analyzed the systems from the perspective of experimental biology research groups in academia, which seek to incorporate the repositories into their synthetic biology workflow. Here, we define the minimal requirements for a repository in this context and develop three usage scenarios, where we then examine the two platforms: (i) supporting the synthetic biology design-build-test-learn cycle, (ii) batch deposit of existing designs into the repository and (iii) discovery and reuse of designs from the repository. Our evaluation of JBEI-ICE and SynBioHub provides an insight into the current state of synthetic biology resources, might encourage their wider adoption and should guide future development to better meet the needs of this user group.",4,1,ysz016,,Software engineering; Data management; Workflow; Synthetic biology; Reuse; Cataloging; Data sharing; Context (language use); State (computer science),JBEI-ICE; SBOL; biological repositories; data management; data sharing; synthetic biology,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC6690502 https://academic.oup.com/synbio/article/4/1/ysz016/5520957 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31423466 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31423466/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/synbio/ysz016,31423466,10.1093/synbio/ysz016,2951620772,PMC6690502,0,001-843-174-127-717; 003-045-213-646-939; 003-951-789-139-811; 003-969-567-381-800; 005-031-129-065-459; 007-727-014-422-83X; 015-017-023-547-312; 024-764-815-400-12X; 025-994-350-971-212; 032-628-994-951-413; 039-374-157-055-838; 042-097-820-522-136; 051-078-370-924-455; 052-100-767-427-937; 052-752-337-370-612; 058-579-308-182-243; 064-844-016-310-719; 073-915-732-873-477; 076-572-676-024-91X; 077-308-254-709-269; 086-376-679-016-936; 108-816-627-691-772; 179-764-415-919-687,6

Standalone software such as our earlier Biological Rhythm Analysis Software Suite (BRASS) is widely used. Different parts of the community have settled on different software packages, sometimes for historical reasons. Recent advances in experimental techniques and available computing power have led to an almost exponential growth in the size of the experimental data sets being generated. This, together with the trend towards multinational, multidisciplinary projects and public data dissemination, has led to a requirement to be able to store and share these large data sets. BioDare (Biological Data repository) is an online system which encompasses data storage, data sharing, and processing and analysis. This chapter outlines the description of an experiment for BioDare, how to upload and share the experiment and associated data, and how to process and analyze the data.

Through basic research, remarkable progress has been made towards the development of targeted therapies. Patient identification, through registries or other means is essential for trial-readiness. The UK FSHD Patient Registry is a patient initiated registry that collects standardised and internationally agreed dataset of self-reported clinical details combined with professionally verified genetic information. It includes four additional questionnaires to capture patient reported outcomes related to pain, quality of life and scapular fixation. Between 2013 and 2015, 518 patients registered 243 males, 241 females with a mean age of 47.8 years. Most of the patients have FSHD type 1 (91.7 %), and weakness of the facial (59.2 %) was the most prevalent symptom at onset, followed by shoulder-girdle muscles (53.3 %) and distal (22.45 %) or proximal lower limb weakness (14.8 %). 85.57 % patients were ambulant or ambulant with assistance at the time of registration, 7.9 % report respiratory insufficiency. The registry has demonstrated utility with the recruitment of patients for a natural history study of infantile onset FSHD, and the longitudinal analysis of patient-related outcomes will provide much-needed baseline information to power future trials. The internationally agreed core dataset enables national registries to participate in a ""Global FSHD registry"".

Here we discuss Cochrane’s practice on data sharing.; ; Open science, as endorsed by the G7,2 includes sharing data, computer code, and materials. It is essential for reproducibility, collaboration, and innovation. We support the work of Cochrane, but are concerned that Cochrane is not sharing all its reviews’ data. These data should be fully accessible for reuse by third parties.; ; Cochrane, a non-profit private company3 and registered charity, produces and maintains systematic reviews in health and social care. Its work is undertaken by a global network of thousands of people,4 and its support largely comes from public funding.5 Most people producing Cochrane reviews are volunteers not specifically funded for this work,67 and Cochrane encourages “crowdsourcing” of work.8910; ; Cochrane editorial bases help volunteers obtain study reports and manually extract the wealth of data needed to generate systematic reviews.111213 Cochrane teams use RevMan software14 to produce files in standard format (XML), storing information on the studies, their methods, and results for publication in the Cochrane Library.; ; Benefits of sharing extracted data from trials and systematic reviews are well known, as are the costs of not sharing.13151617 Sharing maximises transparency, reliability of data extraction, and syntheses. It improves access to data—saving time and money—and opens new avenues of inquiry.18 Sharing is associated with increased citations,19 more publications,20 and reuse for new purposes.16; ; Structured data from Cochrane should be fully accessible for download, reuse, and review (box 1).

Biobanking gives rise to ethical challenges, such as informed consent, benefit sharing, confidentiality, ownership, commercialization and public participation which are harder to navigate in LMIC settings due to disparities in research infrastructure and capacity.  This paper summarizes presentations on Biobank related case studies from two countries, with a focus on challenges in the regulatory and governance framework and suggestions on how to mitigate them.   Methods: Two case studies of Biobanks from LMICs have been used . The case studies were presented at the 2018 Global Forum on Bioethics in Research (GFBR) meeting on the “Ethics of data sharing and Biobanking in health research”. Results: The case studies show that an integrated, well-regulated platform for human biological materials and data ensures good quality of human biological materials, saves resources and promotes mutual collaboration of work among researchers. National regulatory bodies are required to generate Biobanking guidelines and policies to facilitate guidance to the rapidly changing landscape of science. Discussion: In general, LMICs have weaker research regulatory infrastructure and governance mechanisms for Biobanks than high-income countries. This has increased the fear of exploitation i.e. unfair distribution of risks and benefits. Establishment of Biobanks and producing effective scientific outcomes based on the Biobanking resources is difficult without a proper legislative, regulatory and governance framework. Conclusion: These two case studies from different LMICs settings show that although in both settings there is strong awareness of the scientific and population health value of Biobanks and strong commitment to their establishment, regulatory and ethical guidance show gaps that need to be addressed.",4,,171,,Biobank; Business; Bioethics; Public participation; Population health; Data sharing; Biorepository; Corporate governance; Knowledge management; Confidentiality,Biobanking; Biobanks; Biological materials; Data sharing; Governance; LMICs,,,Medical Research Council; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; National Institutes of Health; Wellcome Trust,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-171/v1/xml https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32954012 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-171 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7479498 https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR101847,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15442.1,32954012,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15442.1; 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15442.2,2986083783,PMC7479498,0,016-614-412-652-257; 017-797-698-182-414; 023-097-073-292-349; 023-796-029-087-981; 024-189-703-242-165; 025-307-969-921-06X; 029-318-164-249-893; 039-823-986-871-016; 077-117-554-195-456; 087-466-915-331-459; 095-586-015-547-357; 096-830-515-465-217; 098-134-529-196-12X; 121-056-662-154-253,6

The government has published a ‘National AI Strategy’, but it is unclear how effective this will be given doubts about levels of public trust. One key concern is the UK’s apparent ‘side-lining’ of the law. A series of events were convened to investigate critical legal perspectives on the issues, culminating in an expert workshop addressing five sectors. Participants discussed AI in the context of wider trends towards automated decision-making (ADM). A recent proliferation in legal actions is expected to continue. The discussions illuminated the various ways in which individual examples connect systematically to developments in governance and broader ‘AI-related decision-making’, particularly due to chronic problems with transparency and awareness. This provides a fresh and current insight into the perspectives of key groups advancing criticisms relevant to policy in this area. Policymakers’ neglect of the law and legal processes is contributing to quality issues with recent practical ADM implementation in the UK. Strong signals are now required to switch back from the vicious cycle of increasing mistrust to an approach capable of generating public trust. Suggestions are summarised for consideration by policymakers.",,,1,35,Public policy; Government; Political science; Neglect; Public trust; Quality (business); Context (language use); Transparency (behavior); Corporate governance; Public relations,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13600869.2021.1999075 https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/179687/ https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/legal-contestation-of-artificial-intelligence-related-decision-ma,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13600869.2021.1999075,,10.1080/13600869.2021.1999075,3209108780,,0,013-115-153-832-10X; 014-707-084-094-435; 023-063-388-078-229; 024-929-723-859-593; 033-003-504-208-464; 038-819-088-709-334; 042-626-506-855-566; 042-697-724-238-492; 049-083-183-101-984; 049-282-693-993-355; 056-256-664-382-154; 059-490-912-767-323; 060-493-471-461-669; 060-801-248-128-021; 063-432-677-340-141; 068-102-610-268-843; 086-125-171-464-483; 092-387-126-666-374; 092-948-478-375-308; 094-581-471-765-72X; 100-602-451-110-916; 105-741-325-360-449; 108-061-075-809-871; 113-166-007-149-439; 118-714-132-349-874; 125-197-456-663-879; 137-455-886-112-588; 147-286-935-075-495; 147-656-978-199-629; 149-673-344-865-578; 156-263-641-578-737; 166-766-153-979-942; 172-222-123-979-257; 183-981-742-054-292,0

The literature has identified a range of factors that are important for shaping public responses and in particular has noted that public support for research conducted through data linkage or data sharing is contingent on a number of conditions being met. In order to examine the relative importance of these conditions a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was conducted via an online questionnaire among members of Ipsos MORI's online panel in Scotland. The survey was completed by 1,004 respondents. Overall the two most influential factors shaping respondents' preferences are: the type of data being linked; and, how profits are managed and shared. The type of data being linked is roughly twice as important as who the researchers are. There were slight differences across age groups and between genders and slight differences when comparing respondents with and without long term health conditions. The most notable differences between respondents were found when comparing respondents according to employment and working sector. This study provides much needed evidence regarding the relative importance of various conditions which may be essential for securing and sustaining public support for data-linkage in health research. This may be useful for indicating which factors to focus on in future public engagement and has important implications for the design and delivery of research and public engagement activities. The continuously evolving nature of the field means it will be necessary to revisit the key conditions for public support on an ongoing basis and to examine the contexts and circumstances in which these might change.",3,1,429,,Private sector; Psychology; Marketing; Order (exchange); Public engagement; MEDLINE; Data sharing; Data Linkage; Discrete choice experiment; Computer-assisted web interviewing,,,,Medical Research Council (MR/K007017/1) United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32935004/ https://ijpds.org/article/view/429 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/public-preferences-regarding-data-linkage-for-health-research-a-d https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/254087 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7299474 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/public-preferences-regarding-data-linkage-for-health-research-a-discrete-choice-experiment(1e865168-134a-45db-941f-b0961e86862e).html https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/254087 https://core.ac.uk/download/322480881.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v3i1.429,32935004,10.23889/ijpds.v3i1.429,2810500495,PMC7299474,0,007-406-314-592-593; 009-806-618-674-542; 022-462-083-682-339; 038-309-113-387-411; 043-279-124-924-936; 062-720-464-027-725; 068-207-068-268-026; 071-827-673-101-799; 085-320-250-288-390; 089-419-489-410-998; 099-519-625-413-714; 154-598-931-851-377; 162-725-859-796-180,11

The premise is that if supply is limited to just a few major suppliers the risk of supply disruption is increased, although in reality it depends on many more factors that can be complicated to measure. In addition, there is a wide range of possible methods for measuring supply diversity or concentration, some involving the use of complicated formulas, which can easily become bewildering to the non-statistician. Often the intricacies of their use, the data inputs and sources, and the resulting indices, are not fully understood with the consequent risk of misinformed decisions being based upon them. This paper examines a selection of the available indicators, discusses their limitations and illustrates how a simple index, such as concentration ratio, can be as informative as more complicated approaches. Further, it uses the trends in supply diversity for five minerals (fluorspar, lithium, coal, copper and nickel), taken at decadal intervals over the past century, to demonstrate that a snapshot index taken at a single point in time does not accurately determine whether the level of supply concentration is a cause for concern.",58,,202,218,Risk analysis (engineering); Criticality; Premise; Single point; Supply disruption; Key factors; Computer science,,,,Natural Environment Research Council,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030142071730274X https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030142071730274X https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jrpoli/v58y2018icp202-218.html https://core.ac.uk/download/158368509.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resourpol.2018.05.007,,10.1016/j.resourpol.2018.05.007,2806557871,,0,011-785-562-723-211; 021-709-381-325-853; 026-079-862-320-568; 027-159-330-840-104; 033-261-450-302-093; 040-510-250-163-285; 045-600-873-889-470; 049-526-682-465-117; 074-214-671-912-165; 080-112-126-006-458; 092-957-064-174-551; 094-185-104-052-037; 095-757-046-132-772; 100-786-769-812-458; 153-989-330-109-814; 164-047-074-920-324,22

Hunter; Ian R Hall,"Abstract Background Concern about health misinformation is longstanding, especially on the Internet. Methods Using agent-based models, we considered the effects of such misinformation on a norovirus outbreak, and some methods for countering the possible impacts of “good” and “bad” health advice. The work explicitly models spread of physical disease and information (both online and offline) as two separate but interacting processes. The models have multiple stochastic elements; repeat model runs were made to identify parameter values that most consistently produced the desired target baseline scenario. Next, parameters were found that most consistently led to a scenario when outbreak severity was clearly made worse by circulating poor quality disease prevention advice. Strategies to counter “fake” health news were tested. Results Reducing bad advice to 30% of total information or making at least 30% of people fully resistant to believing in and sharing bad health advice were effective thresholds to counteract the negative impacts of bad advice during a norovirus outbreak.

Foster,"In Thailand’s northwestern Tak province, contextual conditions along the border with Myanmar pose difficulties for TB control among migrant populations. Incomplete surveillance data, migrant patient mobility, and loss to follow-up make it difficult to estimate the TB burden and implement effective TB control measures. This multi-methods study examined tuberculosis, tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus co-infection, and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment accessibility for migrants and refugees in Tak province, health system response, and public health surveillance. In this study we conducted 13 interviews with key informants working in public health or TB treatment provision to elicit information on TB treatment availability and TB surveillance practices. In addition we organized 15 focus group discussions with refugee and migrant TB, TB/HIV, and MDR-TB patients and non-patients to discuss treatment access. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis and created treatment availability maps with Google maps. The study identified surveillance, treatment, and funding gaps. Migrant TB cases are underreported in the provincial statistics due to jurisdictional interpretations and resource barriers. Our results suggest that TB/HIV and MDR-TB treatment options are limited for migrants and a heavy reliance on donor funding may lead to potential funding gaps for migrant TB services. We identified several opportunities that positively contribute to TB control in Tak province: improved diagnostics, comprehensive care, and collaboration through data sharing, planning, and patient referrals. The various organizations providing TB treatment to migrant and refugee populations along the border and the Tak Provincial Public Health Office are highly collaborative which offers a strong foundation for future TB control initiatives. Our findings suggest the need to enhance the surveillance system to include all migrant TB patients who seek treatment in Tak province and support efforts by stakeholders on both sides of the border to continue to share data and engage in collaborative planning on TB, TB/HIV, and MDR-TB treatment provision for migrant populations.",17,1,29,29,Health administration; Public health; Health informatics; Refugee; Public health surveillance; Tuberculosis; Nursing research; Traditional medicine; Focus group; Medicine; Environmental health,MDR-TB; Migrants; Surveillance; TB/HIV; Treatment; Tuberculosis,"Adult; Coinfection/epidemiology; Cooperative Behavior; Female; Focus Groups; HIV Infections/epidemiology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myanmar/epidemiology; Refugees/statistics & numerical data; Thailand/epidemiology; Transients and Migrants/statistics & numerical data; Tuberculosis/epidemiology; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant/prevention & control",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28302127 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12913-017-2113-7.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12913-016-1954-9 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28086877 https://core.ac.uk/display/74274992 https://ruor.uottawa.ca/bitstream/10393/35705/1/12913_2016_Article_1954.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5237139 https://www.tropmedres.ac/publications/671343 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5356356 https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-016-1954-9 https://www.ruor.uottawa.ca/handle/10393/35705 https://paperity.org/p/79046574/treating-the-invisible-gaps-and-opportunities-for-enhanced-tb-control-along-the-thailand https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/671343,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-016-1954-9,28302127; 28086877,10.1186/s12913-016-1954-9; 10.1186/s12913-017-2113-7,2576008228,PMC5356356; PMC5237139,0,000-613-660-639-056; 001-548-256-235-429; 006-673-575-960-067; 012-488-942-935-30X; 013-228-353-813-617; 017-906-209-667-104; 019-432-204-100-118; 019-815-386-801-035; 031-049-972-505-09X; 041-838-055-081-01X; 043-198-270-933-537; 056-708-541-969-128; 067-224-704-311-901; 074-293-445-490-548; 077-343-158-158-86X; 161-188-657-138-545; 162-039-151-981-778; 178-692-142-287-605,12

H. Ecker; Stephan Lewandowsky,"Abstract It is well known that information that is initially thought to be correct but then revealed to be false, often continues to influence human judgement and decision making despite people being aware of the retraction. Yet little research has examined the underlying neural substrates of this phenomenon, which is known as the ‘continued influence effect of misinformation’ (CIEM). It remains unclear how the human brain processes critical information that retracts prior claims. To address this question in further detail, 26 healthy adults underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while listening to brief narratives which either involved a retraction of prior information or not. Following each narrative, subjects’ comprehension of the narrative, including their inclination to rely on retracted information, was probed. As expected, it was found that retracted information continued to affect participants’ narrative-related reasoning. In addition, the fMRI data indicated that the continued influence of retracted information may be due to a breakdown of narrative-level integration and coherence-building mechanisms implemented by the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus.",106,,216,224,Psychology; Active listening; Cognitive psychology; Narrative; Judgement; Misinformation; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Precuneus; Affect (psychology); Comprehension,Continued influence effect; Memory updating; Misinformation,Adolescent; Adult; Brain/physiology; Brain Mapping; Communication; Comprehension; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Young Adult,,Medical Research Council (G0700238) United Kingdom,https://osf.io/346pn/ https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/145140269/Exploring_the_neural_substrates_of_misinformation_processing_Manuscript.pdf https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/exploring-the-neural-substrates-of-misinformation-processing https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28987910 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/exploring-the-neural-substrates-of-misinformation-processing https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393217303718 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/exploring-the-neural-substrates-of-misinformation-processing(aff2da0c-021a-46be-a092-79610e396778).html https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/exploring-the-neural-substrates-of-misinformation-processing(aff2da0c-021a-46be-a092-79610e396778).html https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/exploring-the-neural-substrates-of-misinformation-processing(51a6805b-beb4-4134-9b42-8c0f2c518a9d).html https://core.ac.uk/download/151188246.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.003,28987910,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2017.10.003,2761889019,,0,000-090-458-316-333; 000-125-181-498-310; 001-966-007-773-64X; 002-034-769-416-645; 002-117-015-908-153; 003-704-353-801-095; 006-503-138-311-606; 008-338-894-902-336; 009-250-173-050-145; 010-629-061-233-301; 010-874-392-105-688; 011-238-026-793-635; 011-333-377-182-698; 012-749-501-153-823; 013-681-793-911-857; 013-843-659-683-231; 016-595-483-982-092; 018-778-540-276-018; 023-830-510-953-731; 026-800-177-248-503; 031-136-752-436-374; 032-171-645-795-590; 036-015-547-485-354; 039-828-399-385-390; 047-551-606-954-308; 048-602-931-031-746; 049-361-278-531-650; 051-907-706-428-742; 052-185-220-519-876; 053-459-201-895-587; 055-752-529-152-360; 059-740-023-861-001; 061-008-544-092-150; 066-608-905-207-154; 070-715-820-485-444; 080-985-689-631-479; 081-864-272-222-325; 091-331-440-548-019; 093-095-667-582-167; 102-278-067-148-427; 111-259-688-205-239; 114-728-792-322-759; 115-087-071-547-412; 116-923-764-496-248; 117-692-847-595-015; 120-990-900-682-649; 127-868-046-533-796; 138-424-397-048-92X; 150-100-531-200-579; 170-215-158-792-814; 170-511-578-648-743; 170-760-323-431-232; 180-270-997-152-935; 185-583-304-881-019,40

Buckley; Smita Salunke; Karen C Thompson; Gerri Baer; Darren Fegley; Mark A. Turner,"A public workshop entitled ""Challenges and strategies to facilitate formulation development of pediatric drug products"" focused on current status and gaps as well as recommendations for risk-based strategies to support the development of pediatric age-appropriate drug products. Representatives from industry, academia, and regulatory agencies discussed the issues within plenary, panel, and case-study breakout sessions. By enabling practical and meaningful discussion between scientists representing the diversity of involved disciplines (formulators, nonclinical scientists, clinicians, and regulators) and geographies (eg, US, EU), the Excipients Safety workshop session was successful in providing specific and key recommendations for defining paths forward. Leveraging orthogonal sources of data (eg. food industry, agro science), collaborative data sharing, and increased awareness of the existing sources such as the Safety and Toxicity of Excipients for Paediatrics (STEP) database will be important to address the gap in excipients knowledge needed for risk assessment. The importance of defining risk-based approaches to safety assessments for excipients vital to pediatric formulations was emphasized, as was the need for meaningful stakeholder (eg, patient, caregiver) engagement.",536,2,563,569,Risk assessment; Process management; Stakeholder; Session (web analytics); Data sharing; Pediatric drug; Medicine,Excipients; Formulation development; Pediatric; Safety assessment,Animals; Child; Drug Design; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Excipients/chemistry; Humans; Risk Assessment,Excipients,Intramural FDA HHS (FD999999) United States; Medical Research Council (MC_G1100158) United Kingdom,https://core.ac.uk/display/131170738 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5771984 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517317306415 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10046591/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517317306415 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5771984 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28729174/ https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3010759/ https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201802222349708784 https://core.ac.uk/download/131170738.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2017.07.042,28729174,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2017.07.042,2735707002,PMC5771984,0,002-365-564-587-56X; 003-975-008-365-960; 009-080-823-848-062; 010-486-424-425-850; 020-408-870-887-712; 022-568-963-998-222; 023-240-609-712-196; 038-207-014-303-182; 038-219-788-777-435; 038-887-399-402-65X; 038-944-629-622-403; 050-126-578-259-420; 077-255-840-955-781; 103-574-624-468-099; 106-906-751-395-846,15

H. Ecker; Stephan Lewandowsky,"Abstract Upon receiving a correction, initially presented misinformation often continues to influence people's judgment and reasoning. Whereas some researchers believe that this so-called continued influence effect of misinformation (CIEM) simply arises from the insufficient encoding and integration of corrective claims, others assume that it arises from a competition between the correct information and the initial misinformation in memory. To examine these possibilities, we conducted two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. In each study, participants were asked to (a) read a series of brief news reports that contained confirmations or corrections of prior information and (b) evaluate whether subsequently presented memory probes matched the reports' correct facts rather than the initial misinformation. Both studies revealed that following correction-containing news reports, participants struggled to refute mismatching memory probes, especially when they referred to initial misinformation (as opposed to mismatching probes with novel information). We found little evidence, however, that the encoding of confirmations and corrections produced systematic neural processing differences indicative of distinct encoding strategies. Instead, we discovered that following corrections, participants exhibited increased activity in the left angular gyrus and the bilateral precuneus in response to mismatching memory probes that contained prior misinformation, compared to novel mismatch probes. These findings favour the notion that people's susceptibility to the CIEM arises from the concurrent retention of both correct and incorrect information in memory.",193,,46,56,Encoding (memory); Neural correlates of consciousness; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Misinformation; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Precuneus; Left angular gyrus; Neural processing; Prior information,,Adolescent; Adult; Brain/physiology; Communication; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory/physiology; Young Adult,,Medical Research Council (G0700238) United Kingdom,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.03.014 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/keeping-track-of-alternative-facts-the-neural-correlates-of-proce https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/186876691/Keeping_Track_of_Alternative_Facts_Manuscript.pdf https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201902258878391700 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919301879 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage193.html#GordonQBEL19 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30872047 https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/keeping-track-of-alternative-facts-the-neural-correlates-of-proce,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.03.014,30872047,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.03.014,2921762243,,0,000-090-458-316-333; 000-125-181-498-310; 000-344-890-213-242; 002-034-769-416-645; 002-519-483-601-146; 002-610-063-008-757; 002-999-391-059-623; 003-251-712-767-767; 003-704-353-801-095; 003-862-912-108-312; 005-944-470-910-720; 006-503-138-311-606; 007-611-758-596-977; 008-338-894-902-336; 008-776-743-763-092; 010-275-209-659-152; 010-629-061-233-301; 010-779-916-040-147; 010-874-392-105-688; 011-333-377-182-698; 011-424-453-426-054; 012-749-501-153-823; 013-681-793-911-857; 013-843-659-683-231; 017-862-602-803-086; 018-851-897-635-966; 022-246-385-962-575; 022-643-058-467-381; 023-830-510-953-731; 025-156-289-323-474; 025-271-659-994-35X; 026-487-116-350-338; 027-109-545-168-399; 030-488-659-255-723; 030-849-957-127-616; 031-080-720-277-356; 031-136-752-436-374; 032-961-482-723-985; 033-111-137-599-501; 035-806-535-278-264; 036-582-167-898-609; 039-159-754-482-043; 039-828-399-385-390; 044-040-519-785-346; 044-725-477-148-50X; 047-551-606-954-308; 051-568-253-483-947; 051-907-706-428-742; 052-185-220-519-876; 053-459-201-895-587; 054-194-823-893-098; 055-314-004-809-999; 055-977-709-408-543; 056-938-462-750-324; 059-740-023-861-001; 059-925-170-699-906; 063-992-337-646-22X; 066-481-690-591-236; 066-608-905-207-154; 067-971-032-875-964; 081-915-288-004-418; 082-579-905-173-994; 082-745-313-973-69X; 086-401-314-376-519; 088-702-417-633-364; 091-331-440-548-019; 094-404-005-408-154; 096-357-634-855-428; 098-578-934-179-785; 110-078-759-679-61X; 110-671-025-667-203; 114-728-792-322-759; 115-087-071-547-412; 120-990-900-682-649; 123-398-041-900-72X; 127-918-822-577-576; 130-252-032-471-881; 148-286-105-181-498; 150-100-531-200-579; 162-313-651-880-42X; 170-215-158-792-814; 170-511-578-648-743; 181-375-773-024-026,12

As part of such efforts, the posting of data online is often portrayed as commonly beneficial: individual scientists accrue greater prominence while at the same time fostering communal knowledge. Yet, how scientists in non-Western research settings assess such calls for openness has been the subject of little empirical study. Based on extended fieldwork with biochemistry laboratories in sub-Sahara Africa, this paper examines a variety of reasons why scientists opt for closure over openness with regard to their own data. We argue that the heterogeneity of research environments calls into question many of the presumptions made as part of open data. Inequalities in research environments can mean that moves towards sharing create binds and dilemmas. These observations suggest that those promoting openness must critically examine current research governance and funding systems that continue to perpetuate di...",34,3-4,207,224,Empirical research; Variety (cybernetics); Sociology; Closure (psychology); Data sharing; Open data; Corporate governance; Public relations; Inequality; Openness to experience,,,,Leverhulme Trust,https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/promet/v34y2016i3-4p207-224.html https://www.scienceopen.com/hosted-document?doi=10.1080/08109028.2017.1325142 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08109028.2017.1325142 https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/25196,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08109028.2017.1325142,,10.1080/08109028.2017.1325142,2594945426,,0,000-522-581-657-13X; 000-785-692-812-344; 001-302-506-567-486; 003-032-712-535-464; 006-007-079-033-104; 006-425-128-281-246; 009-373-310-180-940; 010-527-516-552-564; 016-225-198-578-80X; 023-097-073-292-349; 024-681-845-609-852; 026-822-799-343-422; 028-031-533-669-566; 032-334-241-931-131; 036-138-099-943-445; 038-824-642-263-293; 039-696-705-772-937; 042-349-628-331-282; 042-862-818-162-640; 044-047-602-252-93X; 044-230-020-749-669; 045-821-757-333-028; 046-977-743-302-236; 047-004-742-743-385; 052-429-406-625-691; 060-415-090-794-386; 060-713-609-759-751; 091-182-490-204-656; 107-349-646-706-013; 109-074-428-462-404; 118-085-022-435-430; 130-938-054-665-683; 133-351-443-524-047; 133-735-783-927-320; 142-053-376-671-178; 145-534-673-773-02X,5

At the same time, twenty-first century states are increasingly concerned that this data could also be used for purposes of bioterrorism. There is thus a tension between the desire to promote the sharing of data, as encapsulated by the Open Data movement, and the desire to prevent this data from ‘falling into the wrong hands’ as represented by ‘dual use’ policies. Both frameworks posit a moral duty for life sciences researchers with respect to how they should make their data available. However, Open data and dual use concerns are rarely discussed in concert and their implementation can present scientists with potentially conflicting ethical requirements. Discussion Both dual use and Open data policies frame scientific data and data dissemination in particular, though different, ways. As such they contain implicit models for how data is translated. Both approaches are limited by a focus on abstract conceptions of data and data sharing. This works to impede consensus-building between the two ethical frameworks. As an alternative, this paper proposes that an ethics of responsible management of scientific data should be based on a more nuanced understanding of the everyday data practices of life scientists. Responsibility for these ‘micromovements’ of data must consider the needs and duties of scientists as individuals and as collectively-organised groups. Summary Researchers in the life sciences are faced with conflicting ethical responsibilities to share data as widely as possible, but prevent it being used for bioterrorist purposes. In order to reconcile the responsibilities posed by the Open Data and dual use frameworks, approaches should focus more on the everyday practices of laboratory scientists and less on abstract conceptions of data.",17,1,29,29,Frame (artificial intelligence); Philosophy of medicine; Sociology; Data management; Order (exchange); Element (criminal law); Data sharing; Open data; Management science; Engineering ethics; DUAL (cognitive architecture),,"Biological Science Disciplines/ethics; Biomedical Research/ethics; Bioterrorism; Dual Use Research/ethics; Ethics, Research; Genomics/ethics; Humans; Information Dissemination; Moral Obligations; Policy; Research Personnel/ethics; Social Responsibility",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12910-016-0112-6.pdf https://0-bmcmedethics-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6 https://philpapers.org/rec/BEZBSA https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6/fulltext.html https://core.ac.uk/display/81859672 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4869374 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27184750 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/656454,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6,27184750,10.1186/s12910-016-0112-6,2402858054,PMC4869374,0,000-785-692-812-344; 009-810-264-928-761; 013-141-915-399-509; 016-287-922-284-196; 019-538-368-158-59X; 021-016-082-052-03X; 023-954-389-252-259; 025-456-891-173-338; 027-120-308-689-470; 031-056-350-637-069; 032-125-141-715-991; 033-037-502-441-508; 039-719-395-430-673; 039-751-847-356-313; 041-229-127-618-629; 041-819-258-177-042; 042-306-349-866-073; 047-986-375-658-765; 052-639-816-234-621; 058-690-726-137-395; 060-193-688-777-651; 060-840-197-607-218; 062-444-616-254-321; 065-061-784-496-187; 076-836-849-618-369; 077-371-414-506-455; 079-295-007-196-358; 081-428-370-569-495; 083-147-550-827-377; 088-158-288-448-544; 102-308-210-932-64X; 103-239-470-212-024; 108-346-321-679-793; 112-676-267-621-641; 115-030-911-770-610; 117-536-577-693-672; 123-235-929-805-286; 140-507-931-893-361; 145-534-673-773-02X; 151-382-146-166-137; 167-078-567-551-863; 186-670-491-897-885; 188-270-297-190-317; 190-982-665-367-153; 199-761-904-006-899,3

West; Go Yoshizawa; Anna Middleton,"Public trust is central to the collection of genomic and health data and the sustainability of genomic research. To merit trust, those involved in collecting and sharing data need to demonstrate they are trustworthy. However, it is unclear what measures are most likely to demonstrate this. We analyse the ‘Your DNA, Your Say’ online survey of public perspectives on genomic data sharing including responses from 36,268 individuals across 22 low-, middle- and high-income countries, gathered in 15 languages. We examine how participants perceived the relative value of measures to demonstrate the trustworthiness of those using donated DNA and/or medical information. We examine between-country variation and present a consolidated ranking of measures. Providing transparent information about who will benefit from data access was the most important measure to increase trust, endorsed by more than 50% of participants across 20 of 22 countries. It was followed by the option to withdraw data and transparency about who is using data and why. Variation was found for the importance of measures, notably information about sanctions for misuse of data—endorsed by 5% in India but almost 60% in Japan. A clustering analysis suggests alignment between some countries in the assessment of specific measures, such as the UK and Canada, Spain and Mexico and Portugal and Brazil. China and Russia are less closely aligned with other countries in terms of the value of the measures presented. Our findings highlight the importance of transparency about data use and about the goals and potential benefits associated with data sharing, including to whom such benefits accrue. They show that members of the public value knowing what benefits accrue from the use of data. The study highlights the importance of locally sensitive measures to increase trust as genomic data sharing continues globally.",13,1,1,12,Business; Marketing; Ranking; Relative value; Public trust; Sanctions; Public value; Data sharing; Transparency (behavior); Data access,,,,Wellcome Trust (206194) United Kingdom,https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/81507016-89c1-4ab4-bbd2-8e6934f14c29 https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/demonstrating-trustworthiness-when-collecting-and-sharing-genomic http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1574863 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13073-021-00903-0 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/145748 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34034801 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/145748/1/145748%20-%20Demonstrating%20trustworthiness%20when%20collecting%20and%20sharing%20genomic%20data.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13073-021-00903-0.pdf https://repository.globethics.net/handle/20.500.12424/4076816 https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-021-00903-0 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13073-021-00903-0/figures/4 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/85a2e27f-09c0-38ea-b180-9c32b76c9e3c/ https://eprints.utas.edu.au/37613/ https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03346023 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8147072 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34034801,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13073-021-00903-0,34034801,10.1186/s13073-021-00903-0,3164102793,PMC8147072,0,001-505-930-572-954; 002-233-715-333-627; 003-866-096-267-347; 004-297-420-977-295; 005-168-044-166-864; 006-991-949-353-784; 009-385-547-866-383; 023-698-315-722-430; 025-456-891-173-338; 028-777-616-341-751; 030-305-706-347-985; 032-394-109-268-293; 033-518-993-294-246; 036-138-700-226-851; 037-246-066-578-757; 042-558-635-197-000; 043-674-663-213-033; 047-632-315-687-283; 048-894-355-893-950; 051-885-200-969-600; 053-611-874-344-310; 066-971-101-246-437; 067-873-374-340-653; 072-868-735-218-085; 082-786-814-709-177; 110-581-998-093-091; 111-389-890-923-942; 115-518-669-480-656; 116-557-269-826-070; 118-909-273-885-291; 135-750-746-451-261; 168-355-737-867-836,17

Abrams; Polly Clayden; Marta Boffito; Saye Khoo; Helen Rees; Amandine Cournil; Willem D F Venter; Celicia Serenata; Matthew Chersich,"INTRODUCTION To adequately ascertain drug safety and efficacy, drug trials need to include participants from all groups likely to receive the medication following approval. Pregnant women, however, are mostly excluded from trials, and women participating are often required to use highly effective contraception and taken off study product (even off study) if they conceive. There is little commercial incentive for including pregnant women in clinical trials, even when preclinical animal and human pharmacokinetic and safety data appear reassuring. With this conservative approach, large numbers of pregnant women are exposed to drug postlicensing with little known about drug safety and efficacy, and little done to systematically monitor outcomes of pregnancy exposure. DISCUSSION The article focuses on antiretrovirals for treating and preventing HIV, and presents potential approaches which could extend to other therapeutic areas, to obtaining adequate and timely data to inform use of these drugs in this population. Most importantly the pregnancy risk profile of investigational agents can be systematically stratified from low to high risk, based on guidelines from regulatory bodies. This stratification can determine the progress through preclinical work with animals and non-pregnant women to opportunistic studies among women who become pregnant on a clinical trial or within routine clinical treatment. Stratification can include pregnant women in clinical trials, concurrent with Phase II/III trials in non-pregnant adults, and ultimately to postmarketing surveillance for outcomes in pregnant women and their infants. Each step can be enabled by clear criteria from international and local regulatory bodies on progression through study phases, standardized protocols for collecting relevant data, collaborative data sharing, pregnancy outcomes surveillance systems supported by committed funding for these endeavours. CONCLUSIONS A formalized step-wise approach to including pregnant women in antiretroviral drug research should become the new norm. Systematic implementation of this approach would yield more timely and higher quality pregnancy dosing, safety and efficacy data. Through more vigorous action, regulatory bodies could responsibly overcome reluctance to include pregnant women in drug trials. Funders, researchers and programme implementers need to be galvanized to progressively include pregnant women in research - the use of newer, more effective drugs in women is at stake (349).",22,9,e25372,,Intensive care medicine; Postmarketing surveillance; Dosing; Pregnancy; Dolutegravir; Drug; Population; Incentive; Clinical trial; Medicine,"

Billings; Julie MacInnes; Rasa Mikelyte; Elizabeth Welch; Kath Checkland,"With innovation in service delivery increasingly viewed as crucial to the long-term sustainability of health systems, NHS England launched an ambitious new model of care (Vanguard) programme in 2015. Supported by a £350 million transformation fund, 50 Vanguard sites were to act as pilots for innovation in service delivery, to move quickly to change the way that services were delivered, breaking down barriers between sectors and improving the coordination and delivery of care. As part of a national evaluation of the Vanguard programme, we conducted an evidence synthesis to assess the nature and quality of locally commissioned evaluations. With access to a secure, online hub used by the Vanguard and other integrated care initiatives, two researchers retrieved any documents from a locally commissioned evaluation for inclusion. All identified documents were downloaded and logged, and details of the evaluators, questions, methodological approaches and limitations in design and/or reporting were extracted. As included evaluations varied in nature and type, a narrative synthesis was undertaken. We identified a total of 115 separate reports relating to the locally commissioned evaluations. Five prominent issues relating to evaluation conduct were identified across included reports: use of logic models, number and type of evaluation questions posed, data sharing and information governance, methodological challenges and evaluation reporting in general. A combination of resource, data and time constraints means that evaluations often attempted to but did not fully address the wide range of questions posed by individual Vanguards. Significant investment was made in independent local evaluations of the Vanguard programme by NHS England. This synthesis represents the only comprehensive attempt to capture methodological learning and may serve as a key resource for researchers and policy-makers seeking to understand investigating large-scale system change, both within the NHS and internationally.

Kayler; Lucy E Selman,"A living-donor kidney transplant (LDKT) is one of the best treatments for kidney failure. The UK's LDKT activity falls behind that of many other countries, and there is evidence of socioeconomic inequity in access. We aimed to develop a UK-specific multicomponent intervention to support eligible individuals to access a LDKT. The intervention was designed to support those who are socioeconomically-deprived and currently disadvantaged, by targeting mediators of inequity identified in earlier work. We identified three existing interventions in the literature which target these mediators: a) the Norway model (healthcare practitioners contact patients' family with information about kidney donation), b) a home education model, and c) a Transplant candidate advocate model. We undertook intervention development using the Person-Based Approach (PBA). We performed in-depth qualitative interviews with people with advanced kidney disease (n = 13), their family members (n = 4), and renal and transplant healthcare practitioners (n = 15), analysed using thematic analysis. We investigated participant views on each proposed intervention component. We drafted intervention resources and revised these in light of comments from qualitative 'think-aloud' interviews. Four general themes were identified: i) Perceived cultural and societal norms; ii) Influence of family on decision-making; iii) Resource limitation, and iv) Evidence of effectiveness. For each intervention discussed, we identified three themes: for the Norway model: i) Overcoming communication barriers and assumptions; ii) Request from an official third party, and iii) Risk of coercion; for the home education model: i) Intragroup dynamics; ii) Avoidance of hospital, and iii) Burdens on participants; and for the transplant candidate advocates model: i) Vested interest of advocates; ii) Time commitment, and iii) Risk of misinformation. We used these results to develop a multicomponent intervention which comprises components from existing interventions that have been adapted to increase acceptability and engagement in a UK population. This will be evaluated in a future randomised controlled trial.",16,6,e0253667,,Socioeconomic status; Psychology; Health care; Randomized controlled trial; Psychological intervention; Misinformation; Intervention (counseling); Population; Family medicine; Thematic analysis,,"Adult; Aged; Donor Selection; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Living Donors; Male; Middle Aged; Tissue and Organ Procurement; United Kingdom",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (214554/Z/18/Z) United Kingdom,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253667 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253667 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PLoSO..1653667B/abstract https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34170946/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34170946 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8232417 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/development-of-an-intervention-to-improve-access-to-living-donor-,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253667,34170946,10.1371/journal.pone.0253667,3177190867,PMC8232417,0,003-214-680-623-976; 004-579-794-524-691; 006-704-608-214-677; 009-299-623-546-736; 009-627-096-122-615; 013-038-057-145-08X; 013-233-473-918-292; 013-774-640-206-084; 015-443-842-273-003; 015-770-263-993-477; 015-869-339-671-029; 017-319-937-236-381; 017-527-638-142-728; 020-354-711-510-378; 020-850-747-133-087; 021-241-368-546-052; 024-519-428-170-054; 024-739-222-758-295; 027-681-112-631-648; 028-015-749-931-72X; 028-531-437-545-417; 029-596-824-221-192; 037-550-015-414-716; 038-485-298-392-198; 039-129-281-805-158; 041-641-826-368-328; 042-182-195-219-516; 043-238-613-105-80X; 044-584-607-455-991; 053-062-438-124-013; 061-930-181-039-813; 071-976-696-758-75X; 077-336-583-472-301; 080-477-969-183-577; 092-248-240-361-355; 095-008-639-184-115; 100-931-774-603-501; 106-979-116-070-708; 112-435-799-092-325; 121-068-142-522-188; 124-486-859-257-562; 133-662-921-684-220; 158-820-258-676-360; 162-959-148-644-342; 167-381-051-372-09X; 177-850-060-420-817,0

These systems pose many unique design challenges which have received considerable attention within HCI, including the engagement of users. However, less attention has been paid to the use of personal devices in public health. Integrating self-reported data within the context of clinical care suggests the need to design interfaces to support data management, sense-making, risk-assessment, feedback and patient-provider relationships. This paper reports on a qualitative design study for the clinical interface of a mobile application for the self-report of psychological wellbeing and depression during pregnancy. We examine the design tensions which arise in managing the expectations and informational needs of pregnant women, midwives, clinical psychologists, GPs and other health professionals with respect to a broad spectrum of wellbeing. We discuss strategies for managing these tensions in the design of technologies required to balance personal information with public health.",135,,102373,102373,Mental health; Public health; Psychology; Data management; Personally identifiable information; Data sharing; Context (language use); Broad spectrum; Public relations; Mobile technology,Data sharing; Disclosure; Engagement; Mental health; Midwifery; Perinatal depression; Pregnancy; Self report; Wellbeing,,,National Institute for Health Research; Science Foundation Ireland,https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/handle/10356/148916 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6959837/ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.102373 https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/148916/2/Personal%20information%20and%20public%20health_%20Design%20tensions%20in%20sharing%20and%20monitoring%20wellbeing%20in%20pregnancy.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32127731 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijmms/ijmms135.html#DohertyBBMCD20 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581919301326 https://www.lenus.ie/handle/10147/630392 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32127731/ https://www.rti.org/publication/personal-information-and-public-health https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1071581919301326,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.102373,32127731,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.102373,2987657081,PMC6959837,0,001-588-230-162-133; 002-038-700-802-773; 002-429-022-456-063; 003-299-792-163-762; 003-812-460-319-286; 004-998-239-544-34X; 005-362-205-395-30X; 006-000-974-427-853; 006-472-224-487-393; 007-029-556-050-710; 007-116-210-880-587; 007-561-080-234-098; 008-069-295-892-903; 008-435-983-807-888; 008-855-465-457-815; 008-973-621-379-271; 009-199-452-901-714; 010-937-057-625-622; 010-961-279-503-428; 014-240-780-188-543; 015-419-717-029-28X; 018-515-651-168-496; 018-552-066-929-795; 019-203-267-570-150; 020-184-606-784-933; 020-328-182-359-617; 021-355-200-509-739; 022-103-430-954-833; 022-963-937-864-765; 023-127-857-050-844; 024-564-245-981-594; 026-941-120-040-276; 027-533-933-018-408; 027-823-571-062-561; 028-203-359-318-418; 029-795-835-405-116; 030-345-693-835-707; 030-906-906-682-845; 031-128-752-232-283; 031-222-502-049-823; 032-250-052-179-974; 033-026-720-535-891; 033-402-595-592-817; 035-587-647-815-522; 036-734-972-915-395; 036-904-945-566-176; 037-615-169-430-502; 038-113-017-827-03X; 038-936-648-396-544; 041-157-801-686-026; 041-972-747-319-997; 042-325-703-272-192; 043-999-759-005-744; 046-211-229-895-025; 049-359-337-851-599; 049-932-055-432-918; 050-425-872-689-966; 050-691-373-292-720; 052-084-726-849-343; 053-094-842-885-136; 053-195-870-021-311; 054-152-699-097-880; 054-268-945-285-620; 056-644-855-459-745; 056-674-463-235-977; 058-045-934-219-537; 058-669-537-936-79X; 059-134-790-619-697; 061-058-310-258-803; 062-015-936-029-38X; 064-193-228-537-070; 064-393-321-285-089; 068-058-918-056-403; 068-818-914-212-594; 072-852-061-973-618; 073-495-303-107-151; 076-095-984-502-793; 076-393-135-236-692; 077-285-708-491-809; 077-396-822-656-234; 079-336-558-020-445; 079-443-177-342-145; 080-130-769-354-949; 080-156-200-061-960; 081-157-650-514-913; 083-253-390-266-994; 085-705-320-798-255; 086-644-582-102-967; 086-868-382-140-478; 087-190-010-213-875; 087-530-003-857-777; 090-987-796-439-185; 091-013-310-617-561; 093-603-942-030-796; 094-306-114-858-016; 096-392-291-064-467; 097-175-016-192-910; 098-233-204-596-41X; 098-950-277-295-601; 100-143-638-004-283; 101-834-870-287-360; 102-269-848-041-548; 103-280-560-262-281; 112-235-012-863-784; 113-996-564-180-634; 114-140-860-480-410; 119-751-488-057-919; 120-563-936-873-205; 120-650-464-487-781; 124-104-242-662-692; 125-953-451-982-564; 126-837-036-102-695; 127-660-723-014-991; 135-643-539-175-088; 137-545-841-550-698; 141-232-566-563-108; 146-948-664-597-892; 149-183-015-286-629; 150-168-789-378-156; 151-039-351-577-658; 152-006-051-960-917; 153-782-424-295-410; 155-165-807-538-319; 155-880-485-399-24X; 156-227-812-945-426; 163-196-530-511-552; 164-071-409-252-269; 165-626-359-350-524; 166-283-386-907-249; 178-210-679-344-660; 183-890-228-132-24X; 185-015-110-347-20X; 192-616-195-427-301,4

Sunnerhagen; Marian C. Brady,"Stroke survivors experience complex combinations of impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. The essential components of stroke rehabilitation remain elusive. Determining efficacy in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is challenging; there is no commonly agreed primary outcome measure for rehabilitation trials. Clinical guidelines depend on proof of efficacy in RCTs and meta-analyses. However, diverse trial aims, differing methods, inconsistent data collection, and use of multiple assessment tools hinder comparability across trials. Consistent data collection in acute stroke trials has facilitated meta-analyses to inform trial design and clinical practice. With few exceptions, inconsistent data collection has hindered similar progress in stroke rehabilitation research. There is an urgent need for the routine collection of a core dataset of common variables in rehabilitation trials. The European Stroke Organisation Outcomes Working Group, the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Common Data Elements project, and the Collaborative Stroke Audit and Research project have called for consistency in data collection in stroke trials. Standardizing data collection can decrease study start up times, facilitate data sharing, and inform clinical guidelines. Although achieving consensus on which outcome measures to use in stroke rehabilitation trials is a considerable task, perhaps a feasible starting point is to achieve consistency in the collection of data on demography, stroke severity, and stroke onset to inclusion times. Longer term goals could include the development of a consensus process to establish the core dataset.

A few research studies have considered the effect that sharing biometric data has on those individuals sharing this data. However, little is known regarding the social impact of sharing this data in real-time and online. In this study, we investigate whether there is value in sharing heart rate data within social applications and whether sharing this data influences the behavior of those seeing this data. We do so by conducting a study where the heart rate data of runners competing in a 5-km road race is shared in real-time with 140 online spectators. We collect rich quantitative data of user interaction though server logs, and a qualitative data set through interviews and online users' comments. We then compare and contrast the behavior of online spectators who are presented with heart rate data together with contextual data, and those who are only presented with contextual data, for example, location. We also examine whether this difference is dependent on the social relation between the athletes and the spectators. Results indicate that spectators who are presented with the runners' heart rate data support the athletes more and rate the presented system more positively. These effects are dependent on the social tie between the athletes and spectators. This is one of the first studies to carry out an empirical investigation in the wild on the effects of sharing heart rate data in an online social context. In this light, in addition to supporting earlier literature, the outcomes present new insights and research directions within the sporting context.",105,,56,67,Internet privacy; Social environment; Social relation; Psychology; Context (language use); Athletes; Crowd psychology; Crowdsourcing; Contextual design; Qualitative property,,,,UK Digital Economy Programme; UK Research Council,https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/biometric-data-sharing-in-the-wild-investigating-the-effects-on-o https://core.ac.uk/display/83920447 https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/227955933/bio.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijmms/ijmms105.html#CurmiFW17 https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/biometric-data-sharing-in-the-wild-investigating-the-effects-on-o https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/85966/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581917300484 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581917300484 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.03.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.03.008,,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2017.03.008,2607045250,,0,004-121-710-253-202; 007-116-210-880-587; 007-605-137-401-283; 016-265-835-130-255; 017-363-913-765-025; 018-448-510-233-189; 020-961-072-515-934; 021-902-790-186-65X; 025-009-968-722-071; 026-600-128-563-463; 027-885-466-347-534; 029-719-911-497-282; 032-222-766-260-151; 037-572-927-816-416; 038-658-408-896-50X; 038-981-724-576-567; 041-446-263-825-308; 042-778-872-883-471; 050-368-036-025-429; 050-864-654-392-915; 053-289-143-427-590; 058-696-401-379-73X; 066-989-773-101-578; 071-066-918-176-016; 074-412-811-135-415; 075-717-059-601-61X; 075-786-488-521-553; 078-106-229-576-047; 083-339-325-154-328; 090-550-391-761-713; 092-019-619-543-20X; 098-041-340-325-327; 098-303-664-904-197; 101-046-488-861-846; 102-690-026-939-139; 106-730-328-601-917; 108-421-464-789-575; 112-143-766-626-285; 114-643-414-511-496; 119-976-654-280-663; 122-146-535-656-766; 130-667-629-171-341; 148-434-640-575-95X; 163-148-199-358-810; 163-706-379-731-057; 173-173-387-654-18X,9
716,010-098-461-609-566,Demonstrably doing accountability in the Internet of Things,2018-12-24,2018,journal article,International Journal of Law and Information Technology,09670769; 14643693,Oxford University Press (OUP),United Kingdom,Lachlan Urquhart; Tom Lodge; Andy Crabtree,"This paper explores the importance of accountability to data protection, and how it can be built into the Internet of Things (IoT). The need to build accountability into the IoT is motivated by the opaque nature of distributed data flows, inadequate consent mechanisms, and lack of interfaces enabling end-user control over the behaviours of internet-enabled devices. The lack of accountability precludes meaningful engagement by end-users with their personal data and poses a key challenge to creating user trust in the IoT and the reciprocal development of the digital economy. The EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) seeks to remedy this particular problem by mandating that a rapidly developing technological ecosystem be made accountable. In doing so it foregrounds new responsibilities for data controllers, including data protection by design and default, and new data subject rights such as the right to data portability. While GDPR is ‘technologically neutral’, it is nevertheless anticipated that realising the vision will turn upon effective technological development. Accordingly, this paper examines the notion of accountability, how it has been translated into systems design recommendations for the IoT, and how the IoT Databox puts key data protection principles into practice.",27,1,1,27,Internet privacy; Business; Key (cryptography); Digital economy; Accountability; Privacy engineering; Edge computing; General Data Protection Regulation; Systems design; Data Protection Act 1998,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/78865742/eay015.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180107168U/abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07168 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/demonstrably-doing-accountability-in-the-internet-of-things https://academic.oup.com/ijlit/article/27/1/1/5259368 https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/78865742/eay015.pdf https://doi.org/10.1093/ijlit/eay015 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1801.html#abs-1801-07168 https://core.ac.uk/download/286810144.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ijlit/eay015,,10.1093/ijlit/eay015,2963716342,,0,,11

Kazarian; Francis Martin; Julian Moger; Nicholas Stone; Josep Sulé-Suso,"Vibrational spectroscopies, based on infrared absorption and/or Raman scattering provide a detailed fingerprint of a material, based on the chemical content. Diagnostic and prognostic tools based on these technologies have the potential to revolutionise our clinical systems leading to improved patient outcome, more efficient public services and significant economic savings. However, despite these strong drivers, there are many fundamental scientific and technological challenges which have limited the implementation of this technology in the clinical arena, although recent years have seen significant progress in addressing these challenges. This review examines (i) the state of the art of clinical applications of infrared absorption and Raman spectroscopy, and (ii) the outstanding challenges, and progress towards translation, highlighting specific examples in the areas of in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro applications. In addition, the requirements of instrumentation suitable for use in the clinic, strategies for pre-processing and statistical analysis in clinical spectroscopy and data sharing protocols, will be discussed. Emerging consensus recommendations are presented, and the future perspectives of the field are assessed, particularly in the context of national and international collaborative research initiatives, such as the UK EPSRC Clinical Infrared and Raman Spectroscopy Network, the EU COST Action Raman4Clinics, and the International Society for Clinical Spectroscopy.",143,8,1735,1757,Instrumentation (computer programming);

Kerr,"Issues of balancing data accessibility with ethical considerations and governance of a genomics research biobank, Generation Scotland, are explored within the evolving policy landscape of the past ten years. During this time data sharing and open data access have become increasingly important topics in biomedical research. Decisions around data access are influenced by local arrangements for governance and practices such as linkage to health records, and the global through policies for biobanking and the sharing of data with large-scale biomedical research data resources and consortia. We use a literature review of policy relevant documents which apply to the conduct of biobanks in two areas: support for open access and the protection of data subjects and researchers managing a bioresource. We present examples of decision making within a biobank based upon observations of the Generation Scotland Access Committee. We reflect upon how the drive towards open access raises ethical dilemmas for established biorepositories containing data and samples from human subjects. Despite much discussion in science policy literature about standardisation, the contextual aspects of biobanking are often overlooked. Using our engagement with GS we demonstrate the importance of local arrangements in the creation of a responsive ethical approach to biorepository governance. We argue that governance decisions regarding access to the biobank are intertwined with considerations about maintenance and viability at the local level. We show that in addition to the focus upon ever more universal and standardised practices, the local expertise gained in the management of such repositories must be supported. A commitment to open access in genomics research has found almost universal backing in science and health policy circles, but repositories of data and samples from human subjects may have to operate under managed access, to protect privacy, align with participant consent and ensure that the resource can be managed in a sustainable way. Data access committees need to be reflexive and flexible, to cope with changing technology and opportunities and threats from the wider data sharing environment. To understand these interactions also involves nurturing what is particular about the biobank in its local context.",18,1,80,80,Biobank; Business; Research ethics; Data sharing; Science policy; Open data; Biorepository; Health policy; Data access; Knowledge management,Biobank; Data access; Genomics; Informed consent; Research ethics,"Biological Specimen Banks/ethics; Biomedical Research/ethics; Ethics Committees, Research; Genomics/ethics; Health Policy/legislation & jurisprudence; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Informed Consent/ethics; Social Responsibility",,Medical Research Council (MC_PC_U127561128) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (100597/2/12/2) United Kingdom; Chief Scientist Office (CZD/16/6) United Kingdom; Scottish Funding Council (HR03006) International,https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/26024 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5745812 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29282045 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/50118767/Heeney_Kerr_BMC_2017_BalancingLocalUniversalMaintaining_AccessGenomicsBiobank.pdf https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/balancing-the-local-and-the-universal-in-maintaining-ethical-acce https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-017-0240-7 https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/50118767/Heeney_Kerr_BMC_2017_BalancingLocalUniversalMaintaining_AccessGenomicsBiobank.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12910-017-0240-7.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29282045 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-017-0240-7 https://0-bmcmedethics-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/s12910-017-0240-7 https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/26024 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/3ed50571-d2b6-3700-8715-69e5ecd308d7/ https://philpapers.org/rec/HEEBTL https://core.ac.uk/download/144580356.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-017-0240-7,29282045,10.1186/s12910-017-0240-7,2950703225,PMC5745812,0,000-236-837-467-384; 002-087-618-927-631; 002-637-506-591-946; 006-258-632-472-484; 006-620-743-546-174; 011-474-589-098-251; 012-333-954-300-700; 013-284-710-153-327; 013-461-167-051-365; 013-509-386-926-088; 016-513-542-264-372; 018-474-031-363-591; 019-538-368-158-59X; 021-026-755-886-653; 022-526-129-975-007; 023-028-822-539-62X; 023-334-264-262-667; 026-084-691-737-081; 028-671-218-915-70X; 028-740-121-270-032; 029-222-023-047-36X; 034-870-373-652-953; 036-966-807-133-173; 037-372-625-724-827; 041-564-618-204-429; 042-274-379-407-00X; 042-481-154-822-503; 051-300-902-326-638; 052-384-233-522-507; 052-829-595-203-537; 052-853-150-237-953; 061-206-077-132-885; 063-136-993-708-909; 070-462-022-251-464; 072-920-250-384-590; 075-465-734-221-082; 077-753-711-165-064; 079-509-090-064-188; 080-596-755-380-606; 087-215-287-319-080; 091-182-490-204-656; 092-302-509-105-202; 094-381-625-194-127; 095-703-223-066-478; 099-481-636-147-238; 106-379-338-515-902; 109-895-401-678-262; 112-837-002-663-496; 138-878-406-832-705; 152-823-403-948-461; 165-817-868-647-600; 188-270-297-190-317,17

Chitty,"Objective; To explore womens attidues to NIPT and determine factors influencing their decisions around uptake of NIPT.; ; Method; We conducted qualitative interviews to assess knowledge, attitude and deliberation amongst women offered NIPT in a public health service. In total, 45 women took part in telephone interviews (79% participation rate).; ; Results; Most women could recount the key aspects of NIPT discussed during pre-test counselling but had variable knowledge about Down syndrome. Analysis of women's attitudes towards undergoing NIPT revealed three dominant factorsthey considered when reflecting on the test: 1) how NIPT compared to alternative testing options; 2) reflections on coping; and 3) moral or religious values. Exploring the deliberative process revealed the different paths women take when making decisions. For some it was an extension of the decision to have Down syndrome screening; some considered it early on following the booking-in appointment; others made step-wise decisions about NIPT when it became relevant to them.; ; Conclusion; Our findings support the importance of personalised counselling whereby women and their partners have the opportunity to reflect on the implications of the test results in the context of their own lives and values. Our data highlight the influence of personal circumstances on decision making. This article is protected by copyright.

These aspects of the epidemiology of T2D have not been reliably clarified in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), highlighting the need for context-specific epidemiological studies with the statistical resolution to inform potential preventative and therapeutic strategies. Therefore, as part of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa (H3Africa) initiative, we designed a multi-site study comprising case collections and population-based surveys at 11 sites in eight countries across SSA. The goal is to recruit up to 6000 T2D participants and 6000 control participants. We will collect questionnaire data, biophysical measurements and biological samples for chronic disease traits, risk factors and genetic data on all study participants. Through integrating epidemiological and genomic techniques, the study provides a framework for assessing the burden, spectrum and environmental and genetic risk factors for T2D and its complications across SSA. With established mechanisms for fieldwork, data and sample collection and management, data-sharing and consent for re-approaching participants, the study will be a resource for future research studies, including longitudinal studies, prospective case ascertainment of incident disease and interventional studies.",1,,e5,,Epidemiology; Etiology; Demography; Resource (biology); Disease; MEDLINE; Population; Sample collection; Genetic predisposition; Medicine; Environmental health,Epidemiology; H3Africa; genetics; sub-Saharan Africa; type 2 diabetes,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0901756) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K013491/1) United Kingdom,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S2054420015000068 http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S2054420015000068 https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/publications/813109 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29276615/ https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/global-health-epidemiology-and-genomics/article/h3africa-multicentre-study-of-the-prevalence-and-environmental-and-genetic-determinants-of-type-2-diabetes-in-subsaharan-africa-study-protocol/8CD71C540825BED644203954A7851431 https://core.ac.uk/display/145317836 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4646037/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5732581 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29276615 https://core.ac.uk/download/145317836.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/gheg.2015.6,29276615,10.1017/gheg.2015.6,2294079108,PMC5732581,0,007-730-712-196-101; 009-258-366-752-211; 012-705-304-601-039; 016-797-036-404-077; 018-561-169-282-490; 018-975-553-348-677; 019-772-776-125-610; 020-750-046-308-464; 021-601-811-804-455; 029-586-570-951-988; 029-797-522-583-885; 030-644-932-997-683; 030-977-943-353-176; 040-890-015-951-502; 052-322-297-207-668; 056-151-460-845-89X; 081-279-502-295-347; 085-137-426-097-358; 089-850-402-246-258; 104-326-493-247-889; 118-110-031-651-970; 121-634-818-297-202; 152-313-615-159-27X; 199-730-487-763-618,9

Tonkin; Rachael Gooberman-Hill,"Introduction Over 160 000 people with severe hip or knee pain caused by osteoarthritis undergo total hip (THR) or knee replacement (TKR) surgery each year in the UK within the National Health Service (NHS), and this number is expected to increase. Innovative approaches to evaluating surgical outcomes will be needed to respond to the increasing burden of joint replacement surgery. The Sensor Platform for Healthcare in a Residential Environment, Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration (SPHERE-IRC) have developed a system of sensors that can monitor the health-related behaviours of people living at home. The system includes sensors for the home environment (measuring temperature, humidity, room occupancy, water and electricity usage), a wristband body-worn activity monitor and silhouette (body outline) sensors. The aim of HEmiSPHERE (Hip and knEe study of a Sensor Platform of HEalthcare in a Residential Environment) is to (1) determine the accuracy and feasibility of the sensory data as it compares with conventional assessment of health outcomes after surgery using patient self-reported questionnaires, and (2) to explore how the SPHERE system is useful for everyday clinical decision-making. Methods and analysis A feasibility study recruiting and installing the SPHERE system in the homes of up to 30 NHS adult patients as they undergo a THR or TKR. Through a mixed-methods design, the SPHERE system will monitor and record continuous measurements of daily behaviour.

Series A, Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",1364503x,Royal Society of London,United Kingdom,Paul Townend; Jie Xu; Jim Austin,"The 2011 e-Science All Hands Meeting (AHM) marked the tenth annual gathering of technologists and scientists first brought together by the UK e-Science Programme—the £250 million research venture funded by the UK Research Councils. In the decade since the founding of this programme in 2001, e-science research has evolved from fundamental research focused on computational grids into work involving research from a wide variety of domains, such as bioinformatics, computing, astronomy, physics and medicine. The AHM community is now multinational, interdisciplinary and dynamic, and has recently moved towards addressing the issues and challenges raised by the increasing emergence of cloud computing in daily life. This continuing popularity and success has been highlighted by AHM 2011, hosted at the University of York by the EPSRC White Rose Grid e-Science Centre and attended by over 200 delegates. This Theme Issue provides a snapshot of the community's vibrant diversity, featuring the best papers presented at the conference, peer-reviewed for this issue, written by researchers from many different countries and backgrounds.; ; The first paper in this issue, ‘The application of cloud computing to scientific workflows: a study of cost and performance’ by Berriman et al. [1], discusses a key factor in the use of cloud computing—is it economically beneficial for scientists to use a third-party cloud provider? Following this, Turilli et al. [2], writing in ‘Flexible services for the support of research’, focus on the adoption of the cloud by higher education institutions and address both flexible on-demand access to storage resources and scalability across a heterogeneous set of cloud infrastructures.; ; Turner et al. [3] write of their experiences in developing secure virtual research environments to integrate multidisciplinary research in ‘Secure data sharing across portals: experiences from OneVRE’. Next, Tablan et al. [4] present ‘GATECloud.net: a platform for large-scale, open-source text processing on the cloud’, a paper discussing the authors' cloud-based platform's ability to perform large-scale data-intensive natural language processing experiments by harnessing the computing power of the Amazon Cloud. Additionally, the paper includes a cost–benefit analysis and usage evaluation.; ; Moving away from the cloud, Yang et al. [5] discuss philosophical issues concerning data quality, identify actual user needs on data quality, review current standards and specifications, and propose an integrated model for data quality in the field of Earth observation in ‘An integrated view of data quality in Earth observation’. Service orientation is another interest of the AHM community, and Weeks et al. [6] present a developmental overview of the CARMEN virtual laboratory platform for integrating scientific code through a service-oriented infrastructure in ‘The CARMEN software as a service infrastructure’.; ; In ‘Enhancing research publications using Rich Interactive Narratives’, Takeda et al. [7] describe a mechanism that provides an interactive framework for research publications in the fields of archaeology and chemistry. Following this, Colling et al. [8] discuss the highly important work of the UK's gridPP project in providing the grid infrastructure needed by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in the paper ‘Processing LHC data in the UK’.; ; Returning to the cloud, the work undertaken within the RAPPORT project to investigate the running of a group of multi-domain scientific applications on cloud resources is presented by Cohen et al. [9] in ‘RAPPORT: running scientific high-performance computing applications on the cloud’. Djemame et al. [10] then present their approach to risk management as applied to cloud computing, with a particular emphasis on legal issues, in the paper ‘Legal issues in clouds: towards a risk inventory’.; ; In ‘Developing cloud applications using e-Science Central’, Hiden et al. [11] present an overview of the e-Science Central (e-SC) cloud processing system and its application to a number of e-science projects. Finally, Suresh et al. [12] discuss how cloud computing has the potential for enabling a new technique for using queuing theory to meet specified response-time targets against fluctuating event arrival rates in their paper ‘Scalable and responsive event processing in the cloud’.; ; As can be seen from the above descriptions, the variety, scope and standard of submissions to AHM 2011 was very high; in order to help focus the conference, we are indebted to the Conference Programme Committee, featuring 36 international experts and leaders in their respective fields. Owing to space constraints, many high-quality pieces of research presented at the conference cannot be published in this Theme Issue, but we are confident that the whole body of work presented at the conference will help to continue to drive e-science and digital research both in the UK and abroad.",371,1983,20120082,20120082,Complex event processing; Data mining; Software as a service; Workflow; Data science; Service-orientation; Virtual Laboratory; Data sharing; e-Science; Cloud computing,,,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000984/1) United Kingdom,https://paperity.org/p/48497555/e-science-towards-the-cloud-infrastructures-applications-and-research https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsta.2012.0082 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012RSPTA.37120082T/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538292/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3538292 https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2012.0082,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2012.0082,23230160,10.1098/rsta.2012.0082,2019958170,PMC3538292,0,001-258-357-195-635; 016-279-225-223-726; 016-639-237-698-039; 020-267-222-042-766; 026-467-409-586-215; 026-501-196-474-450; 027-580-611-453-441; 028-116-581-266-385; 073-175-026-564-756; 113-385-235-776-581; 116-286-231-130-308; 151-354-134-284-859,0

Despite this, it goes undiagnosed and untreated in many women attending antenatal care. Smartphones could help support the prompt identification of antenatal depression in this setting. In addition, these devices enable the implementation of ecological momentary assessment techniques, which could be used to assess how mood is experienced during pregnancy. With this study, we; will assess the feasibility of using a bespoke mobile; application (app) running on participants’ own handsets for; the longitudinal (6 months) monitoring of antenatal mood; and screening of depression. Methods and analysis We will use a randomised controlled study design to compare two types of assessment strategies: retrospective + momentary (consisting of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale plus five momentary and two contextual questions),; and retrospective (consisting of the Edinburgh Postnatal; Depression Scale only). We will assess the impact that these strategies have on participant adherence to a prespecified sampling protocol, dropout rates and timeliness of data completion. We will evaluate differences in acceptance of the technology through a short quantitative survey and open-ended questions. We will also assess the potential effect that momentary assessments could have on retrospective data. We will attempt to identify any patterns in app usage through the analysis of log data.

Accurate public health messaging is essential to counter this, but education may also have a role. Early in the outbreak, The London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine partnered with FutureLearn to develop a massive open online course (MOOC) on COVID-19. Our approach was grounded in social constructivism, supporting participation, sharing uncertainties, and encouraging discussion. The first run of the course included over 200,000 participants from 184 countries, with over 88,000 comments at the end of the three-week run. Many participants supported each other’s learning in their responses and further questions. Our experience suggests that open education, and supporting the development of communities of learners, can complement traditional messaging, providing a sustainable approach to countering the spread of misinformation.",5,,105,,Public health; Psychology; Misinformation; Massive open online course; Open education; 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Public relations; Pandemic; Social constructivism,COVID-19; MOOC; education; infodemic,,,Department of Health & Social Care; Wellcome Trust,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-105 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4662936/ https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-105/v1/xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15973.2,34853816,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15973.2,3028762622,PMC8602955,0,013-444-492-765-519; 023-815-648-344-01X; 051-879-891-598-94X; 056-006-599-468-848; 102-075-128-289-398; 106-480-048-307-255; 111-631-194-906-762; 120-188-212-674-372; 133-482-531-004-025,1

L. Namburete; Aris T. Papageorghiou; J. Alison Noble,"Fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers exquisite images of the developing brain but is not suitable for second-trimester anomaly screening, for which ultrasound (US) is employed. Although expert sonographers are adept at reading US images, MR images which closely resemble anatomical images are much easier for non-experts to interpret. Thus in this article we propose to generate MR-like images directly from clinical US images. In medical image analysis such a capability is potentially useful as well, for instance for automatic US-MRI registration and fusion. The proposed model is end-to-end trainable and self-supervised without any external annotations. Specifically, based on an assumption that the US and MRI data share a similar anatomical latent space, we first utilise a network to extract the shared latent features, which are then used for MRI synthesis. Since paired data is unavailable for our study (and rare in practice), pixel-level constraints are infeasible to apply. We instead propose to enforce the distributions to be statistically indistinguishable, by adversarial learning in both the image domain and feature space. To regularise the anatomical structures between US and MRI during synthesis, we further propose an adversarial structural constraint. A new cross-modal attention technique is proposed to utilise non-local spatial information, by encouraging multi-modal knowledge fusion and propagation. We extend the approach to consider the case where 3D auxiliary information (e.g., 3D neighbours and a 3D location index) from volumetric data is also available, and show that this improves image synthesis. The proposed approach is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively with comparison to real fetal MR images and other approaches to synthesis, demonstrating its feasibility of synthesising realistic MR images.",39,12,4413,4424,Image (mathematics); Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Artificial intelligence; Spatial analysis; Pattern recognition; Fetal brain; Medical imaging; Computer science; Computed tomography; Neuroimaging; Feature vector; Image processing,,"Brain/diagnostic imaging; Fetus/diagnostic imaging; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neuroimaging; Ultrasonography",,Department of Health United Kingdom,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9174648/ https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8ce5a71a-4246-4d4f-a635-e2b70552c015 https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2008.08698/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833630 http://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2020.3018560 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2008.html#abs-2008-08698 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32833630 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32833630/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tmi.2020.3018560,32833630,10.1109/tmi.2020.3018560,3080245421,,1,000-257-098-197-44X; 000-612-975-556-453; 001-196-563-904-18X; 002-192-454-260-563; 005-583-146-865-63X; 007-550-312-217-85X; 008-885-213-776-34X; 009-832-929-678-080; 012-709-609-486-711; 014-927-022-282-056; 017-261-220-995-031; 019-552-627-458-353; 020-224-227-050-706; 020-437-556-498-957; 020-581-531-289-338; 028-083-030-361-409; 032-706-413-590-05X; 033-618-533-652-565; 036-061-046-281-051; 038-870-426-053-184; 039-933-184-572-951; 040-281-799-028-850; 041-635-971-816-114; 041-869-455-086-17X; 050-763-041-479-118; 053-879-776-611-603; 068-234-243-944-612; 082-616-033-122-806; 084-959-211-095-861; 100-487-446-115-770; 107-438-086-107-526; 115-936-661-250-487; 127-936-963-662-204; 132-371-993-080-833; 140-599-781-560-30X; 153-166-760-984-822; 155-338-218-673-080; 165-346-671-460-887; 166-593-301-710-660; 170-768-674-435-776; 173-122-154-695-896,5

Agrawal,"KDM4B is a lysine-specific demethylase with a preferential activity on H3K9 tri/di-methylation (H3K9me3/2)-modified histones. H3K9 tri/di-demethylation is an important epigenetic mechanism responsible for silencing of gene expression in animal development and cancer. However, the role of KDM4B on human development is still poorly characterized. Through international data sharing, we gathered a cohort of nine individuals with mono-allelic de novo or inherited variants in KDM4B. All individuals presented with dysmorphic features and global developmental delay (GDD) with language and motor skills most affected. Three individuals had a history of seizures, and four had anomalies on brain imaging ranging from agenesis of the corpus callosum with hydrocephalus to cystic formations, abnormal hippocampi, and polymicrogyria. In mice, lysine demethylase 4B is expressed during brain development with high levels in the hippocampus, a region important for learning and memory. To understand how KDM4B variants can lead to GDD in humans, we assessed the effect of KDM4B disruption on brain anatomy and behavior through an in vivo heterozygous mouse model (Kdm4b+/-), focusing on neuroanatomical changes. In mutant mice, the total brain volume was significantly reduced with decreased size of the hippocampal dentate gyrus, partial agenesis of the corpus callosum, and ventriculomegaly. This report demonstrates that variants in KDM4B are associated with GDD/ intellectual disability and neuroanatomical defects. Our findings suggest that KDM4B variation leads to a chromatinopathy, broadening the spectrum of this group of Mendelian disorders caused by alterations in epigenetic machinery.",107,6,1170,1177,Neuroscience; Ventriculomegaly; Dentate gyrus; Corpus callosum; Polymicrogyria; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Global developmental delay; Agenesis of the corpus callosum; Brain size; Biology,JMJD2B; KDM4B; agenesis of the corpus callosum; dysmorphic hippocampi; global developmental delay; heterozygous variant; intellectual disability; neurodevelopmental disorder,"Animals; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Developmental Disabilities/genetics; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Genetic Variation; Heterozygote; Hippocampus/diagnostic imaging; Histones/metabolism; Humans; Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Methylation; Mice; Nervous System Malformations/genetics; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Seizures/genetics; Signal Transduction","Histones; Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases; KDM4B protein, human; Kdm4b protein, mouse",Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NIAMS NIH HHS (R01 AR068429) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (T32 HD098061) United States,https://repub.eur.nl/pub/132482 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7820620 https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/heterozygous-variants-in-kdm4b-lead-to-global-developmental-delay-and-neuroanatomical-defects(0c9079ab-8c8a-47e1-a8e9-f4de7953c77f).html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929720303980 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33232677 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002929720303980 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/132482/RePub-132482-OA.pdf https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(20)30398-0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7820620 https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/heterozygous-variants-in-kdm4b-lead-to-global-developmental-delay https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepub.eur.nl%3A132482 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33232677/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.11.001,33232677,10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.11.001,3108111879,PMC7820620,0,001-239-072-768-811; 003-551-990-570-408; 005-128-052-234-04X; 005-795-084-097-122; 011-816-643-174-639; 011-871-143-501-295; 012-638-323-649-794; 015-228-381-161-516; 018-691-830-128-265; 020-462-369-658-868; 027-755-688-639-991; 029-029-944-327-804; 029-147-383-366-463; 041-129-740-930-209; 046-710-001-310-277; 056-981-316-256-145; 058-724-258-383-87X; 058-934-257-677-767; 060-292-650-319-261; 063-151-655-479-264; 067-762-857-451-751; 077-218-984-775-20X; 078-128-982-656-458; 083-305-358-566-390; 090-306-320-514-016; 095-023-578-114-492; 109-373-973-732-764; 128-058-683-476-570; 129-262-727-271-273; 143-712-620-207-098; 182-314-065-138-29X,2

Sheppard,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether medRxiv data availability statements describe open or closed data-that is, whether the data used in the study is openly available without restriction-and to examine if this changes on publication based on journal data-sharing policy. Additionally, to examine whether data availability statements are sufficient to capture code availability declarations. DESIGN: Observational study, following a pre-registered protocol, of preprints posted on the medRxiv repository between 25th June 2019 and 1st May 2020 and their published counterparts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Distribution of preprinted data availability statements across nine categories, determined by a prespecified classification system. Change in the percentage of data availability statements describing open data between the preprinted and published versions of the same record, stratified by journal sharing policy. Number of code availability declarations reported in the full-text preprint which were not captured in the corresponding data availability statement. RESULTS: 3938 medRxiv preprints with an applicable data availability statement were included in our sample, of which 911 (23.1%) were categorized as describing open data. 379 (9.6%) preprints were subsequently published, and of these published articles, only 155 contained an applicable data availability statement. Similar to the preprint stage, a minority (59 (38.1%)) of these published data availability statements described open data. Of the 151 records eligible for the comparison between preprinted and published stages, 57 (37.7%) were published in journals which mandated open data sharing. Data availability statements more frequently described open data on publication when the journal mandated data sharing (open at preprint: 33.3%, open at publication: 61.4%) compared to when the journal did not mandate data sharing (open at preprint: 20.2%, open at publication: 22.3%). CONCLUSION: Requiring that authors submit a data availability statement is a good first step, but is insufficient to ensure data availability. Strict editorial policies that mandate data sharing (where appropriate) as a condition of publication appear to be effective in making research data available. We would strongly encourage all journal editors to examine whether their data availability policies are sufficiently stringent and consistently enforced.",16,5,e0250887,,Actuarial science; Bibliometrics; Mandate; Statement (computer science); Data sharing; Protocol (science); Open data; Descriptive statistics; Computer science; Sample (statistics),,"Data Accuracy; Editorial Policies; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Peer Review, Research/methods; Policy; Preprints as Topic/trends",,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR; https://www.nihr.ac.uk/) Doctoral Research Fellowship,https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/a-descriptive-analysis-of-the-data-availability-statements-accomp http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PLoSO..1650887M/abstract https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0250887 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33983972 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33983972 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8118451,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250887,33983972,10.1371/journal.pone.0250887,3161322225,PMC8118451,0,001-929-737-519-085; 002-390-431-067-872; 002-918-579-989-446; 004-293-615-740-10X; 005-777-962-570-173; 007-785-082-576-932; 009-343-800-599-958; 012-366-320-030-754; 012-565-178-658-47X; 015-889-547-854-004; 016-592-102-975-339; 017-708-762-398-483; 018-016-853-344-316; 020-401-040-234-921; 021-147-736-518-151; 021-533-545-870-449; 022-526-129-975-007; 024-741-301-131-75X; 024-817-680-126-560; 026-125-810-364-184; 031-150-089-915-272; 033-874-164-708-457; 034-863-830-389-236; 035-434-138-239-312; 037-127-244-323-019; 038-121-472-280-515; 040-668-028-497-954; 043-885-560-209-568; 046-008-795-335-90X; 053-522-264-439-06X; 055-917-845-410-619; 057-225-340-135-442; 058-960-804-221-136; 059-402-420-924-609; 061-070-992-838-128; 070-462-022-251-464; 072-622-243-836-83X; 075-526-993-947-503; 085-778-468-419-634; 098-641-944-717-89X; 112-536-150-062-933; 114-251-883-659-335; 132-898-707-520-430; 135-541-995-666-588; 141-562-203-874-638; 147-740-455-718-938; 150-325-162-873-23X; 168-219-282-598-29X; 181-834-834-935-836,1

The impact will be localized access to basic research information in various Global South languages to integrate with existing community efforts for establishing the same. Although Wikidata development in this direction seems inevitable, the cultural and social exchange required to establish global multilingual research partnerships could begin now with support rather than later as a second phase effort for including the developing world. Wikipedia and Wikidata are established forums with an existing active userbase for multilingual research collaboration, but the research practices there still are immature.

Baker; Jane Kaye; Sharon F. Terry,"Introduction: Individuals have a moral claim to be involved in the governance of their personal data. Individuals’ rights include privacy, autonomy, and the ability to choose for themselves how they want to manage risk, consistent with their own personal values and life situations. The Fair Information Practices principles (FIPPs) offer a framework for governance. Privacy-enhancing technology that complies with applicable law and FIPPs offers a dynamic governance tool for enabling the fair and open use of individual’s personal data. Perceptions of Risk: Any governance model must protect against the risks posed by data misuse. Individual perceptions of risks are a subjective function involving individuals’ values toward self, family, and society, their perceptions of trust, and their cognitive decision-making skills. The HIPAA Privacy Rule Puts Some Governance in the Hands of Individuals: Individual privacy protections and individuals’ right to choose are codified in the HIPAA Privacy Rule, which attempts to strike a balance between the dual goals of information flow and privacy protection. The choices most commonly given individuals regarding the use of their health information are binary (“yes” or “no”) and immutable. Recent federal recommendations and law recognize the need for granular, dynamic choices. Building a Governance Framework Based in Trust: Avoiding Surprises: Individuals expect that they will govern the use of their own health and genomic data. Failure to build and maintain individuals’ trust increases the likelihood that they will refuse to grant permission to access or use their data. The “no surprises principle” asserts that an individual’s personal information should never be collected, used, transmitted, or disclosed in a way that would surprise the individual were she to learn about it. Fair Information Practices Principles: The FIPPs provide a powerful framework for enabling data sharing and use, while maintaining trust. We introduce the eight FIPPs adopted by the Department of Health and Human Services, and provide examples of their interpretation and implementation. Reducing Risk through Consumer Engagement: Privacy risk and health risk can be reduced by giving consumers control, autonomy, and transparency, and by engaging them in managing their own health. Explicit “consent” may not always be necessary – the FIPPs offer multiple ways to engender trust and avoid surprises. Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly (PEER) We describe the Platform for Engaging Everyone Responsibly (PEER), a technology solution that enables individuals to govern the access to and use of their health information, within an environment that espouses the FIPPs and “no surprises.” Conclusion: Fair and effective governance recognizes the individual’s moral claim to maintain control over the contribution and use of their health and genomic information. Maintaining individuals’ trust in an environment of transparency is essential to assuring continuing access to their data for safe and effective health care and biomedical knowledge advancement.",4,2,1207,1207,Privacy policy; Information privacy; FTC Fair Information Practice; Personally identifiable information; Political science; Human services; Health information technology; Transparency (behavior); Corporate governance; Public relations,Participant governance; health information technology; patient involvement; privacy,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://egems.academyhealth.org/articles/10.13063/2327-9214.1207/print/ http://www.geneticalliance.org/sites/default/files/bibliography/PrivacyFairnessandRespectforIndividuals.pdf https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/256998 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27141520/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27141520 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/27141520 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/619930,http://dx.doi.org/10.13063/2327-9214.1207,27141520,10.13063/2327-9214.1207,2441546371,PMC4827784,0,029-127-585-826-714; 085-389-252-044-889; 090-882-461-758-589; 108-612-771-361-765; 121-404-897-374-064; 144-416-562-287-260; 152-799-218-016-956,23

G. Elia; Nicolas Städler; Oriana Ciani; Rod S Taylor; Sylwia Bujkiewicz,"Abstract Background Progression free survival (PFS) and tumour response (TR) have been investigated as surrogate endpoints for overall survival (OS) in advanced colorectal cancer (aCRC), however their validity has been shown to be suboptimal. In recent years, meta-analytic methods allowing for use of multiple surrogate endpoints jointly have been proposed. Our aim was to assess if PFS and TR used jointly as surrogate endpoints to OS improve their predictive value. Methods Data were obtained from a systematic review of randomised controlled trials investigating effectiveness of pharmacological therapies in aCRC, including systemic chemotherapies, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapies and anti-angiogenic agents. Multivariate meta-analysis was used to model the association patterns between treatment effects on the surrogate endpoints (TR, PFS) and the final outcome (OS). Results Analysis of 33 trials reporting treatment effects on all three outcomes showed reasonably strong association between treatment effects on PFS and OS, however the association parameters were obtained with a large uncertainty. A weak surrogate relationship was noted between the treatment effects on TR and OS. Modelling the two surrogate endpoints, TR and PFS, jointly as predictors of treatment effect on OS gave no marked improvement to surrogate association patterns. Modest improvement in the precision of the predicted treatment effects on the final outcome was noted in studies investigating anti-angiogenic therapy, however it was likely due to chance. Conclusion The joint use of two surrogate endpoints did not lead to marked improvement in the association between treatment effects on surrogate and final endpoints in advanced colorectal cancer.",64,,101665,,Internal medicine; Surrogate endpoint; Oncology; Progression-free survival; Treatment effect; Advanced colorectal cancer; Predictive value; Overall survival; Tumour response; Medicine,Advanced colorectal cancer; Multivariate meta-analysis; Surrogate endpoints,Biomarkers; Colorectal Neoplasms/mortality; Humans; Progression-Free Survival; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Survival Rate; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Treatment Outcome,Biomarkers,Medical Research Council (MR/L009854/1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31911395 https://leicester.figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Combining_tumour_response_and_progression_free_survival_as_surrogate_endpoints_for_overall_survival_in_advanced_colorectal_cancer/11407200 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877782119301754 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877782119301754,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2019.101665,31911395,10.1016/j.canep.2019.101665,2997294948,,0,005-466-503-030-890; 011-278-013-939-603; 013-690-923-146-570; 016-069-093-689-683; 018-355-744-374-459; 023-761-656-791-396; 027-323-638-811-459; 029-233-359-269-963; 030-005-291-027-271; 034-260-852-435-018; 034-858-175-136-825; 042-799-797-240-259; 056-513-159-268-160; 057-552-198-880-342; 064-073-779-013-146; 064-102-034-225-275; 066-240-349-172-778; 066-752-064-643-192; 072-556-139-408-250; 075-861-040-862-058; 082-666-253-542-023; 090-276-024-473-614; 090-460-004-972-58X; 097-360-515-964-254; 113-086-974-032-017; 113-606-731-043-535; 117-045-080-044-11X; 132-931-449-115-417; 148-517-136-453-818; 156-490-597-315-066,3

Tully; Kyle Bozentko; Sarah Clement; Amanda Hunn; Lamiece Hassan; Ruth Norris; Malcolm Oswald; Niels Peek,"Background: The secondary use of health data for research raises complex questions of privacy and governance. Such questions are ill-suited to opinion polling where citizens must choose quickly between multiple-choice answers based on little information. Objective: The aim of this project was to extend knowledge about what control informed citizens would seek over the use of health records for research after participating in a deliberative process using citizens’ juries. Methods: Two 3-day citizens’ juries, of 17 citizens each, were convened to reflect UK national demographics from 355 eligible applicants. Each jury addressed the mission “To what extent should patients control access to patient records for secondary use?” Jurors heard from and questioned 5 expert witnesses (chosen either to inform the jury, or to argue for and against the secondary use of data), interspersed with structured opportunities to deliberate among themselves, including discussion and role-play. Jurors voted on a series of questions associated with the jury mission, giving their rationale. Individual views were polled using questionnaires at the beginning and at end of the process. Results: At the end of the process, 33 out of 34 jurors voted in support of the secondary use of data for research, with 24 wanting individuals to be able to opt out, 6 favoring opt in, and 3 voting that all records should be available without any consent process. When considering who should get access to data, both juries had very similar rationales. Both thought that public benefit was a key justification for access. Jury 1 was more strongly supportive of sharing patient records for public benefit, whereas jury 2 was more cautious and sought to give patients more control. Many jurors changed their opinion about who should get access to health records: 17 people became more willing to support wider information sharing of health data for public benefit, whereas 2 moved toward more patient control over patient records. Conclusions: The findings highlight that, when informed of both risks and opportunities associated with data sharing, citizens believe an individual’s right to privacy should not prevent research that can benefit the general public. The juries also concluded that patients should be notified of any such scheme and have the right to opt out if they so choose. Many jurors changed their minds about this complex policy question when they became more informed. Many, but not all, jurors became less skeptical about health data sharing, as they became better informed of its benefits and risks.

In addition, we identify a number of ethico-legal issues that require careful consideration, including returning data to family members, mitigating against unintended consequences, and ensuring appropriate governance.

In this paper, we analyse these new guidelines in the context of recent scholarly debates and technological concerns. They foray into the less-trodden areas of bias and non-discrimination, the significance of advertising, the nature of “solely” automated decisions, impacts upon groups and the inference of special categories of data—at times, appearing more to be making or extending rules than to be interpreting them. At the same time, they provide only partial clarity – and perhaps even some extra confusion – around both the much discussed “right to an explanation” and the apparent prohibition on significant automated decisions concerning children. The Working Party appears to feel less mandated to adjudicate in these conflicts between the recitals and the enacting articles than to explore altogether new avenues. Nevertheless, the directions they choose to explore are particularly important ones for the future governance of machine learning and artificial intelligence in Europe and beyond.",34,2,398,404,Profiling (information science); Political science; Data governance; Adjudication; Inference; CLARITY; General Data Protection Regulation; Corporate governance; Public relations; Data Protection Act 1998,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) centre CREATe; EPSRC Digital Economy Hub Horizon at the University of Nottingham,https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/257348 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/clsr/clsr34.html#VealeE18 https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/257348/909000D8-6E33-440A-AE8C-A81CBF484400.pdf https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10046182/ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2017.12.002 https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/257348 https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3071679 https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/clarity-surprises-and-further-questions-in-the-article-29-working https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026736491730376X https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/clarity-surprises-and-further-questions-in-the-article-29-working-party-draft-guidance-on-automated-decisionmaking-and-profiling(20cea362-82c2-41ac-b83a-3502939f4f80).html https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/62844/ https://core.ac.uk/download/145658086.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2017.12.002,,10.1016/j.clsr.2017.12.002,2769968138,,0,,46

Zahedi; Sally Spendiff; Dan Cox; Andreas Roos; Hanns Lochmüller,"Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of rare disorders that cause fatigable muscle weakness due to defective signal transmission at the neuromuscular junction, a specialized synapse between peripheral motor neurons and their target muscle fibers. There are now over 30 causative genes that have been reported for CMS. Of these, there are 10 that are associated with a limb-girdle pattern of muscle weakness and are thus classed as LG-CMS. Next-generation sequencing and advanced methods of data sharing are likely to uncover further genes that are associated with similar clinical phenotypes, contributing to better diagnosis and effective treatment of LG-CMS patients. This review highlights clinical and pathological hallmarks of LG-CMS in relation to the underlying genetic defects and pathways. Tailored animal and cell models are essential to elucidate the exact function and pathomechanisms at the neuromuscular synapse that underlie LG-CMS.

Although up to 45% of cases are primarily or partly due to cerebrovascular disease, little is known of these mechanisms or treatments because most dementia research still focuses on pure Alzheimer's disease. An improved understanding of the vascular contributions to neurodegeneration and dementia, particularly by small vessel disease, is hampered by imprecise data, including the incidence and prevalence of symptomatic and clinically “silent” cerebrovascular disease, long-term outcomes (cognitive, stroke, or functional), and risk factors. New large collaborative studies with long follow-up are expensive and time consuming, yet substantial data to advance the field are available. In an initiative funded by the Joint Programme for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, 55 international experts surveyed and assessed available data, starting with European cohorts, to promote data sharing to advance understanding of how vascular disease affects brain structure and function, optimize methods for cerebrovascular disease in neurodegeneration research, and focus future research on gaps in knowledge. Here, we summarize the results and recommendations from this initiative. We identified data from over 90 studies, including over 660,000 participants, many being additional to neurodegeneration data initiatives. The enthusiastic response means that cohorts from North America, Australasia, and the Asia Pacific Region are included, creating a truly global, collaborative, data sharing platform, linked to major national dementia initiatives. Furthermore, the revised World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases version 11 should facilitate recognition of vascular-related brain damage by creating one category for all cerebrovascular disease presentations and thus accelerate identification of targets for dementia prevention.",12,12,1235,1249,Epidemiology; Health care; Disease; Dementia; Data sharing; Cognitive decline; Health policy; Medicine; Gerontology; Developmental cognitive neuroscience,"Cerebrovascular disease; Dementia; Neurodegeneration, Cohorts, Survey; Small vessel disease","Aged; Cerebrovascular Disorders/complications; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Dementia, Vascular; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Neurodegenerative Diseases/etiology; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires",,NINDS NIH HHS (R01 NS017950) United States; Medical Research Council (G1001354) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M013111/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G1001245) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K026992/1) United Kingdom; CIHR Canada; Medical Research Council (G0701120) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G1002605) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0500247) United Kingdom; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG010129) United States,https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/ws/files/8050612/6402308.pdf https://alzheimersanddementiajournal.com/article/S1552-5260(16)30064-4/addons https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/344935 https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/metacohorts-for-the-study-of-vascular-disease-and-its-contributio https://www.dementiasplatform.uk/publications/metacohorts-for-the-study-of-vascular-disease-and-its-contribution-to-cognitive-decline-and-neurodegeneration-an-initiative-of-the-joint-programme-for-neurodegenerative-disease-research https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F167929 http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/id/eprint/37284 https://snucm.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/metacohorts-for-the-study-of-vascular-disease-and-its-contributio https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/portal/files/8050612/6402308.pdf https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/530cdd5f-f8b3-4020-835b-b798019c28ee http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1552526016300644 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27490018 https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.004 https://lilloa.univ-lille.fr/handle/20.500.12210/16647 https://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/44317/ https://ucdavis.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/metacohorts-for-the-study-of-vascular-disease-and-its-contributio https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/230941 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/167929 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1514600/ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.004 https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/GIN/hal-01382655 http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1514600/ https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01382655 https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/797282 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1552526016300644 https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/797447/Metacohorts%2020160623.pdf http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/134632/ https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/metacohorts-for-the-study-of-vascular-disease-and-its-contributio https://www.alzheimersanddementia.com/article/S1552-5260(16)30064-4/fulltext https://okayama.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/metacohorts-for-the-study-of-vascular-disease-and-its-contributio https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01382655/document,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.004,27490018,10.1016/j.jalz.2016.06.004,2516094476,PMC5399602,0,001-011-946-276-148; 001-400-302-641-954; 002-628-558-488-989; 005-784-145-412-736; 006-109-301-676-723; 006-248-778-963-711; 006-804-568-836-268; 008-756-437-672-194; 010-300-179-955-859; 010-853-248-855-65X; 011-712-319-008-253; 012-475-228-106-843; 013-487-547-470-516; 013-900-981-493-856; 014-171-811-684-624; 014-651-825-205-359; 018-038-134-040-727; 021-537-851-138-078; 022-079-323-607-636; 022-137-241-971-939; 022-562-841-613-489; 023-744-005-169-080; 024-445-407-564-354; 029-413-535-459-183; 031-607-083-289-95X; 032-202-006-944-202; 032-881-601-436-373; 034-928-043-420-585; 036-030-832-068-459; 036-720-393-513-618; 040-658-133-083-99X; 044-010-489-797-276; 044-588-632-694-490; 046-718-041-032-044; 047-923-703-059-000; 049-046-398-519-226; 049-634-861-166-911; 050-152-639-387-047; 051-054-918-894-751; 055-904-218-385-503; 060-339-524-427-46X; 060-394-375-283-192; 060-665-248-955-728; 061-212-281-575-043; 065-621-053-199-552; 066-731-245-158-695; 069-334-870-913-764; 069-532-478-604-438; 074-887-470-115-481; 075-674-890-005-710; 075-879-777-864-07X; 077-467-857-734-648; 078-424-747-763-620; 079-623-380-178-625; 080-817-190-120-001; 093-337-737-971-942; 102-231-663-804-541; 105-312-931-311-81X; 160-943-128-766-976; 171-384-335-920-586,57

We explored how public health practitioners engaged with the licensing system following this change, and what helped or hindered their efforts. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 public health actors, audio-recorded, and analysed using an inductive framework approach. Many interviewees viewed the new objective as synonymous with reducing population-level alcohol consumption; however, this view was not always shared by licensing actors, some of whom did not accept public health as a legitimate goal of licensing, or prioritised economic development instead. Some interviewees were surprised that the public health evidence they presented to licensing boards did not result in their hoped-for outcomes; they reported that licensing officials did not always understand or value health data or statistical evidence. While some tried to give ""impartial"" advice to licensing boards, this was not always easy; others were clear that their role was one of ""winning hearts and minds"" through relationship-building with licensing actors over time. Notwithstanding the introduction of the public health objective, there remain significant, and political, challenges in orienting local premises licensing boards towards decisions to reduce the availability of alcohol in Scotland.",14,3,221,,Public health; Business; Health promotion; Qualitative research; Perception; Value (ethics); Licensure; Health data; Public relations; Politics,alcohol; availability; licensing; outlet density; public involvement,Adult; Alcohol Drinking/prevention & control; Alcoholic Beverages/standards; Female; Health Promotion/methods; Humans; Licensure/legislation & jurisprudence; Male; Middle Aged; Public Health/legislation & jurisprudence; Qualitative Research; Scotland,,Chief Scientist Office (SPHSU13) United Kingdom; British Heart Foundation United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K023195/1) United Kingdom; Chief Scientist Office (SPHSU15) United Kingdom; Department of Health United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12017/13) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12017/15) United Kingdom; Chief Scientist Office (SCAF/15/02) United Kingdom,https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/25093/1/ijerph-14-00221.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28241512 https://doaj.org/article/c24b353c62174ede9c0033ec018969c1 https://core.ac.uk/display/89350040 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/137449/ http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28241512 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20173213910?q=(similar%3a20103323896) https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/25093 https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/14/3/221/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/14/3/221 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/3553949/ https://core.ac.uk/download/80696915.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph14030221,28241512,10.3390/ijerph14030221,2590335710,PMC5369057,0,004-075-803-459-600; 004-155-362-173-534; 005-098-455-211-411; 005-668-763-025-102; 006-416-387-812-916; 006-783-751-063-638; 008-373-743-891-776; 008-766-124-904-993; 010-842-566-955-740; 013-333-312-247-617; 013-893-447-980-408; 014-970-844-802-165; 017-375-655-751-330; 017-379-046-419-795; 017-789-128-155-078; 018-546-356-056-266; 018-784-097-339-977; 019-632-965-300-68X; 021-034-279-318-064; 025-304-163-832-419; 026-113-116-874-346; 026-311-653-099-258; 028-923-245-216-021; 031-644-541-210-587; 033-776-709-420-535; 037-897-949-455-696; 038-101-487-950-392; 052-094-049-882-136; 056-037-870-055-787; 057-395-131-153-355; 059-000-253-047-01X; 059-544-147-171-119; 064-323-466-749-071; 064-527-389-584-553; 065-891-600-755-539; 070-209-275-391-319; 073-236-171-492-775; 075-256-496-989-510; 076-045-538-637-326; 091-587-161-607-353; 105-012-889-794-840; 118-062-265-568-99X; 119-755-820-884-667; 121-157-621-251-105; 121-656-522-591-987; 129-277-365-535-578; 151-041-798-065-002; 172-951-998-103-75X; 186-816-093-779-065; 194-940-885-228-307,11

This paper examines how acceptance of data sharing pertains to the perceived similarities and differences between DNA and other forms of personal data. It explores the perceptions of representative publics from the USA, Canada, the UK and Australia (n = 8967) towards the donation of DNA and health data. Fifty-two percent of this public held ‘exceptionalist’ views about genetics (i.e., believed DNA is different or ‘special’ compared to other types of medical information). This group was more likely to be familiar with or have had personal experience with genomics and to perceive DNA information as having personal as well as clinical and scientific value. Those with personal experience with genetics and genetic exceptionalist views were nearly six times more likely to be willing to donate their anonymous DNA and medical information for research than other respondents. Perceived harms from re-identification did not appear to dissuade publics from being willing to participate in research. The interplay between exceptionalist views about genetics and the personal, scientific and clinical value attributed to data would be a valuable focus for future research.",28,4,424,434,Sociology; Genomics; Donation; Value (ethics); Publics; Genetic exceptionalism; Data sharing; Public relations; Medical genetics; Scale (social sciences),,"Adult; Australia; Canada; Female; Genetic Privacy/psychology; Genetic Testing/ethics; Genome, Human; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Information Dissemination; Male; Middle Aged; Public Opinion; United Kingdom; United States",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (206194) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (Wellcome) (206194) International,https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/members-of-the-public-in-the-usa-uk-canada-and-australia-expressing-genetic-exceptionalism-say-they-are-more-willing-to-donate-genomic-data(a5375663-bedd-4e23-ac90-80831c5bff74).html https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/members-of-the-public-in-the-usa-uk-canada-and-australia-expressi https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31784701 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080803 https://eprints.utas.edu.au/32937/ http://oars.uos.ac.uk/1110/ https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/247704 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-019-0550-y https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/313500 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-019-0550-y.pdf http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1374874 https://lup.lub.lu.se/record/7e388c7f-5b42-401d-a859-d4924913bb5b http://ecite.utas.edu.au/136364/1/136364%20-%20Members%20of%20the%20public%20in%20the%20USA%2C%20UK%2C%20Canada%20and%20Australia.pdf http://ecite.utas.edu.au/136364,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41431-019-0550-y,31784701,10.1038/s41431-019-0550-y,2990454706,PMC7080803,0,001-610-630-749-994; 003-254-173-107-586; 003-361-281-809-829; 005-168-044-166-864; 007-406-314-592-593; 010-082-886-718-163; 015-590-559-932-35X; 016-743-775-117-289; 019-372-152-115-163; 020-357-128-942-898; 032-961-071-116-005; 034-680-483-652-252; 035-484-567-766-220; 036-148-257-435-606; 045-348-481-855-683; 045-436-781-828-775; 046-980-265-749-187; 047-632-315-687-283; 054-317-832-665-289; 055-622-564-448-604; 060-592-324-416-634; 071-061-771-305-086; 078-226-711-242-05X; 079-077-975-355-592; 085-320-250-288-390; 090-014-087-990-803; 091-573-323-843-838; 092-452-769-097-572; 097-541-776-603-863; 097-769-161-064-796; 109-895-401-678-262; 112-395-992-022-659; 115-518-669-480-656; 120-841-592-242-879; 128-297-713-860-169; 135-750-746-451-261; 145-432-090-648-860; 167-275-555-617-549,13

Greville-Harris; Jennifer Bostock; Amy Din; Cynthia A. Graham; George Lewith; Christina Liossi; Tim O'Riordan; Peter D White; Lucy Yardley; Felicity L. Bishop,"BACKGROUND: According to established ethical principles and guidelines, patients in clinical trials should be fully informed about the interventions they might receive. However, information about placebo-controlled clinical trials typically focuses on the new intervention being tested and provides limited and at times misleading information about placebos. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to create an informative, scientifically accurate, and engaging website that could be used to improve understanding of placebo effects among patients who might be considering taking part in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. METHODS: Our approach drew on evidence-, theory-, and person-based intervention development. We used existing evidence and theory about placebo effects to develop content that was scientifically accurate. We used existing evidence and theory of health behavior to ensure our content would be communicated persuasively, to an audience who might currently be ignorant or misinformed about placebo effects. A qualitative 'think aloud' study was conducted in which 10 participants viewed prototypes of the website and spoke their thoughts out loud in the presence of a researcher. RESULTS: The website provides information about 10 key topics and uses text, evidence summaries, quizzes, audio clips of patients' stories, and a short film to convey key messages. Comments from participants in the think aloud study highlighted occasional misunderstandings and off-putting/confusing features. These were addressed by modifying elements of content, style, and navigation to improve participants' experiences of using the website. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an evidence-based website that incorporates theory-based techniques to inform members of the public about placebos and placebo effects. Qualitative research ensured our website was engaging and convincing for our target audience who might not perceive a need to learn about placebo effects. Before using the website in clinical trials, it is necessary to test its effects on key outcomes including patients' knowledge and capacity for making informed choices about placebos.",5,2,e106,,Qualitative research; Psychological intervention; Test (assessment); Intervention (counseling); Target audience; Clinical trial; Informed consent; Medicine; Applied psychology; Social psychology; Think aloud protocol,consumer health information; health attitudes; informed consent; placebo effect; qualitative research,,,Arthritis Research UK (20113) United Kingdom; Versus Arthritis (20113) United Kingdom,https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/391101/ http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/32891/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4920960 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27288271/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/27288271 https://www.researchprotocols.org/2016/2/e106/ https://core.ac.uk/download/195284059.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/resprot.5627,27288271,10.2196/resprot.5627,2340654226,PMC4920960,0,001-480-187-856-409; 001-670-602-984-131; 002-975-624-225-877; 003-817-497-378-397; 003-991-211-174-115; 009-299-623-546-736; 009-747-174-928-89X; 010-851-528-983-18X; 011-272-227-576-855; 012-223-925-673-420; 014-023-123-255-055; 015-469-694-266-797; 017-023-626-405-261; 018-068-899-731-674; 019-854-333-654-90X; 022-667-428-391-182; 026-825-796-212-092; 032-738-177-766-119; 034-302-776-009-086; 035-230-974-518-603; 036-265-997-436-48X; 038-893-970-941-304; 039-702-220-248-457; 040-848-353-650-703; 041-162-494-946-911; 044-053-768-186-240; 044-091-597-952-701; 044-671-441-200-520; 044-927-387-913-082; 046-643-289-327-15X; 048-282-937-956-66X; 051-491-519-244-562; 055-415-090-101-278; 058-150-190-728-439; 059-800-633-626-780; 062-320-296-214-675; 066-647-165-698-171; 069-215-662-485-177; 072-643-878-798-796; 074-658-104-159-67X; 077-336-583-472-301; 081-155-610-461-715; 083-365-184-008-157; 084-910-395-989-925; 086-873-720-909-988; 088-215-720-918-217; 095-369-273-336-340; 099-120-818-090-355; 100-451-089-997-474; 113-246-601-846-384; 114-060-653-082-233; 116-830-374-696-305; 132-254-222-580-132; 135-805-472-691-377; 138-935-519-519-481; 170-173-474-903-210,3

We propose an original concept of introducing hologram modulators to allow the use of generative models to interpret complex-valued frequency data directly. This new mechanism enables the pre-trained learning model to generate frequency samples with variations in the underlying generative features. To achieve an object-based hologram generation, we also develop a new generative model, named the channeled variational autoencoder (CVAE). The pre-trained CVAE can then interpret and learn the hidden structure of input holograms. It is thus able to generate holograms through the learning of the disentangled latent representations, which can allow us to specify each disentangled feature for a specific object. Additionally, we propose a new technique called hologram super-resolution (HSR) to super-resolve a low-resolution hologram input to a super-resolution hologram output. Combining the proposed CVAE and HSR, we successfully develop a new approach to generate super-resolved, complex-amplitude holograms for 3D scenes.",29,17,27373,27395,Autoencoder; Deep learning; Optics; Artificial intelligence; Generative model; Holography; Computer vision; Feature (machine learning); Computer science; Artificial neural network; Object (computer science); Holographic display,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/319379 https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?doi=10.1364/OE.418803,http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/oe.418803,34615155,10.1364/oe.418803,3138436933,,0,001-207-246-241-088; 003-755-866-281-558; 007-873-639-743-305; 019-721-907-384-621; 023-612-850-131-448; 023-855-038-918-000; 025-384-948-751-89X; 029-386-249-273-467; 040-500-780-414-708; 047-711-337-323-013; 048-230-625-183-00X; 054-308-934-742-519; 055-309-554-406-67X; 060-528-093-833-898; 081-153-181-463-579; 086-126-846-467-020; 098-885-480-505-792; 127-936-963-662-204; 145-806-182-489-485; 166-726-742-166-601,2

Lawrie; Ryota Hashimoto; Paul M. Thompson; Jenny Turner,"The profile of brain structural abnormalities in schizophrenia is still not fully understood, despite decades of research using brain scans. To validate a prospective meta-analysis approach to analyzing multicenter neuroimaging data, we analyzed brain MRI scans from 2028 schizophrenia patients and 2540 healthy controls, assessed with standardized methods at 15 centers worldwide. We identified subcortical brain volumes that differentiated patients from controls, and ranked them according to their effect sizes. Compared with healthy controls, patients with schizophrenia had smaller hippocampus (Cohen's d=-0.46), amygdala (d=-0.31), thalamus (d=-0.31), accumbens (d=-0.25) and intracranial volumes (d=-0.12), as well as larger pallidum (d=0.21) and lateral ventricle volumes (d=0.37). Putamen and pallidum volume augmentations were positively associated with duration of illness and hippocampal deficits scaled with the proportion of unmedicated patients. Worldwide cooperative analyses of brain imaging data support a profile of subcortical abnormalities in schizophrenia, which is consistent with that based on traditional meta-analytic approaches. This first ENIGMA Schizophrenia Working Group study validates that collaborative data analyses can readily be used across brain phenotypes and disorders and encourages analysis and data sharing efforts to further our understanding of severe mental illness.",21,4,585,553,Psychiatry; Psychology; Neuroscience; Schizophrenia (object-oriented programming); Brain size; Psychology; Neuroscience; Voxel-based morphometry; Bipolar disorder; Dementia; Putamen; Brain mapping; Neuroimaging; Brain size; Schizophrenia,,"Adult; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging; Prospective Studies; Schizophrenia/genetics",,Wellcome Trust (104036) United Kingdom; NIBIB NIH HHS (R01 EB006841) United States; Medical Research Council (MR/K026992/1) United Kingdom; NIBIB NIH HHS (U54 EB020403) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR000153) United States; NIBIB NIH HHS (R01 EB020407) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (U01 MH097435) United States; NIBIB NIH HHS (P41 EB015922) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (P20 GM103472) United States; NIBIB NIH HHS (R01 EB005846) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (R01 MH094524) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (R01 MH101111) United States; NCRR NIH HHS (P41 RR014075) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR001414) United States; NCRR NIH HHS (U24 RR021992) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (K23 MH085096) United States,https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/erratum-subcortical-brain-volume-abnormalities-in-2028-individual-2 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8w0330x1 https://scholars.uthscsa.edu/en/publications/erratum-subcortical-brain-volume-abnormalities-in-2028-individual https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/erratum-subcortical-brain-volume-abnormalities-in-2028-individual https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/erratum-subcortical-brain-volume-abnormalities-in-2028-individual https://escholarship.org/content/qt8w0330x1/qt8w0330x1.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/195282913.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mp.2015.63,26283641; 26033243,10.1038/mp.2015.63; 10.1038/mp.2015.118,2596331123; 1876943069,PMC4668237; PMC5751698,0,000-020-954-303-423; 001-438-082-480-59X; 002-704-273-884-955; 002-999-803-928-11X; 005-068-000-072-681; 005-131-933-907-790; 005-195-799-578-473; 005-829-204-411-474; 006-329-657-849-714; 008-803-753-225-176; 009-722-437-428-336; 014-194-971-683-366; 015-248-051-706-809; 021-524-438-869-050; 021-599-519-881-429; 022-281-330-770-182; 023-474-746-156-343; 025-773-945-516-834; 026-151-818-377-077; 026-953-428-860-80X; 031-818-054-450-257; 031-873-134-206-467; 032-276-961-938-996; 033-329-826-035-295; 033-563-086-414-067; 033-908-332-743-976; 034-194-799-337-490; 035-408-710-879-945; 038-193-280-047-172; 040-682-268-697-761; 045-416-413-742-937; 046-455-614-649-470; 046-536-522-640-844; 047-075-900-570-503; 050-037-272-259-538; 050-564-480-922-343; 052-801-633-348-303; 052-982-098-697-346; 062-477-813-645-939; 063-961-301-104-478; 071-976-157-796-503; 073-021-552-596-385; 074-876-129-097-941; 077-572-663-660-294; 086-421-525-007-56X; 087-709-452-850-896; 088-031-225-339-457; 089-939-498-751-216; 091-388-073-208-625; 094-224-811-628-487; 103-501-622-471-465; 105-916-070-671-123; 108-076-534-859-870; 108-083-853-256-132; 119-808-104-792-24X; 132-275-072-577-159; 133-555-709-883-86X; 139-792-302-706-295; 140-824-129-460-584; 140-854-233-957-061; 142-514-068-234-311; 165-750-888-206-825; 175-893-540-120-466,732

A data commons must establish legally interoperability between datasets to ensure researchers can aggregate and reuse them. This is usually achieved by establishing a shared governance structure. Unfortunately, governance often takes years to negotiate and involves a trade-off between data inclusion and data availability. It can also be difficult for repositories to modify governance structures in response to changing scientific priorities, data sharing practices, or legal frameworks. This problem has been laid bare by the sudden shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper proposes a rapid and flexible strategy for scientific repositories to achieve legal interoperability: the policy-aware data lake. This strategy draws on technical concepts of modularity, metadata, and data lakes. Datasets are treated as independent modules, which can be subject to distinctive legal requirements. Each module must, however, be described using standard legal metadata. This allows legally compatible datasets to be rapidly combined and made available on a just-in-time basis to certain researchers for certain purposes. Global scientific repositories increasingly need such flexibility to manage scientific, organizational, and legal complexity, and to improve their responsiveness to global pandemics.",7,1,lsaa065,,Data governance; Interoperability; Data science; Data sharing; Flexibility (engineering); Corporate governance; Computer science; Commons; Big data; Metadata,big data; data commons; data governance; data sharing; legal interoperability; modularity,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33005429 https://academic.oup.com/jlb/article/7/1/lsaa065/5894236 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33005429 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33005429/ https://doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa065 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7454728,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jlb/lsaa065,33005429,10.1093/jlb/lsaa065,3060958463,PMC7454728,0,,2

Kiel,"Osteoporosis-related fractures are undertreated, due in part to misinformation about recommended approaches to patient care and discrepancies among treatment guidelines. To help bridge this gap and improve patient outcomes, the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research assembled a multistakeholder coalition to develop clinical recommendations for the optimal prevention of secondary fractureamong people aged 65 years and older with a hip or vertebral fracture. The coalition developed 13 recommendations (7 primary and 6 secondary) strongly supported by the empirical literature. The coalition recommends increased communication with patients regarding fracture risk, mortality and morbidity outcomes, and fracture risk reduction. Risk assessment (including fall history) should occur at regular intervals with referral to physical and/or occupational therapy as appropriate. Oral, intravenous, andsubcutaneous pharmacotherapies are efficaciousandcanreduce risk of future fracture.Patientsneededucation,however, about thebenefitsandrisks of both treatment and not receiving treatment. Oral bisphosphonates alendronate and risedronate are first-line options and are generally well tolerated; otherwise, intravenous zoledronic acid and subcutaneous denosumab can be considered. Anabolic agents are expensive butmay be beneficial for selected patients at high risk.Optimal duration of pharmacotherapy is unknown but because the risk for second fractures is highest in the earlypost-fractureperiod,prompt treatment is recommended.Adequate dietary or supplemental vitaminDand calciumintake shouldbe assured. Individuals beingtreatedfor osteoporosis shouldbe reevaluated for fracture risk routinely, includingvia patienteducationabout osteoporosisandfracturesandmonitoringfor adverse treatment effects.Patients shouldbestronglyencouraged to avoid tobacco, consume alcohol inmoderation atmost, and engage in regular exercise and fall prevention strategies. Finally, referral to endocrinologists or other osteoporosis specialists may be warranted for individuals who experience repeated fracture or bone loss and those with complicating comorbidities (eg, hyperparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease).

Nichols,"Methodological research rarely generates a broad interest, yet our work on the validity of cluster inference methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) created intense discussion on both the minutia of our approach and its implications for the discipline. In the present work, we take on various critiques of our work and further explore the limitations of our original work. We address issues about the particular event-related designs we used, considering multiple event types and randomization of events between subjects. We consider the lack of validity found with one-sample permutation (sign flipping) tests, investigating a number of approaches to improve the false positive control of this widely used procedure. We found that the combination of a two-sided test and cleaning the data using ICA FIX resulted in nominal false positive rates for all data sets, meaning that data cleaning is not only important for resting state fMRI, but also for task fMRI. Finally, we discuss the implications of our work on the fMRI literature as a whole, estimating that at least 10% of the fMRI studies have used the most problematic cluster inference method (p = .01 cluster defining threshold), and how individual studies can be interpreted in light of our findings. These additional results underscore our original conclusions, on the importance of data sharing and thorough evaluation of statistical methods on realistic null data.",40,7,2017,2032,Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Communication noise; Null (SQL); Inference; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Data sharing; Event (probability theory); Computer science; False positive paradox; Resting state fMRI,ICA FIX; cluster inference; false positives; functional magnetic resonance imaging; permutation; physiological noise,Artifacts; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Brain Mapping/methods; Cluster Analysis; Electricity/adverse effects; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods,,NIBIB NIH HHS (R01 EB015611) United States; Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse International; Center for Industrial Information Technology (CENIIT) International; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NIH HHS (S10 OD023696) United States; Wellcome Trust (100309/Z/12/Z) United Kingdom; Linköping University International; Swedish research council (2013-5229 and 2017-04889) International,https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03185 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180403185E/abstract http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1256136 https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/935147 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6445744 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30318709/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24350 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30318709 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hbm.24350 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03185 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/935147,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24350,30318709,10.1002/hbm.24350,2796214606,PMC6445744,0,000-244-909-623-738; 000-335-587-086-354; 000-989-131-923-604; 001-095-523-465-917; 001-158-483-600-664; 001-447-139-179-963; 002-508-279-413-929; 002-913-768-964-579; 003-568-872-953-281; 006-009-212-742-962; 006-803-438-163-208; 006-925-557-331-177; 007-587-854-884-605; 008-350-629-356-372; 009-531-378-283-656; 010-537-745-678-143; 011-128-800-132-493; 011-400-407-504-254; 011-543-929-020-220; 013-805-498-966-347; 013-846-901-078-632; 016-849-046-643-25X; 017-113-368-940-606; 018-347-086-009-563; 020-394-341-495-452; 020-631-487-740-656; 021-165-058-917-389; 021-408-578-279-302; 022-643-058-467-381; 023-219-963-793-930; 024-967-906-654-352; 025-507-377-576-967; 027-805-155-907-546; 030-488-659-255-723; 030-595-995-361-027; 032-896-346-001-699; 037-600-013-760-933; 041-664-053-286-575; 045-543-154-359-133; 047-305-918-670-538; 047-715-162-071-86X; 048-200-979-720-282; 050-671-715-707-490; 053-672-306-505-509; 053-693-591-617-675; 055-031-712-810-990; 060-058-189-796-792; 061-087-736-877-09X; 066-445-575-317-719; 072-532-178-096-177; 079-971-804-809-920; 082-325-971-692-282; 082-706-498-272-66X; 087-502-173-806-341; 087-741-722-529-032; 094-404-005-408-154; 095-876-903-619-676; 101-852-297-286-312; 102-670-947-124-753; 108-889-251-960-299; 110-488-118-441-259; 113-388-364-377-644; 116-252-525-556-579; 161-367-926-807-027; 163-802-641-669-579; 178-692-806-074-937; 182-720-635-384-593,44

Participant-centric initiatives (PCI) are defined as ""tools, programs, and projects that empower participants to engage in the research process"" using digital technologies and have the potential to provide a number of benefits to both participants and researchers, including the promotion of public trust in medical research, improved quality of research, increased recruitment and retention, and improved health care delivery. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this scoping review is to describe the extent and range of PCIs across the United Kingdom, United States, and Japan that are designed to facilitate medical research. METHODS: The methodological framework described by Levac et al will be applied to this scoping review. We will search electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing, and Allied Health Literature and CiNii), grey literature sources, Internet search engines (Google and Bing), and hand search key journals and reference lists of relevant articles. All digital tools and programs will be eligible for inclusion if there is a description of key features and functions that fall within the parameters of a PCI. Only those that play a role in medical research will be included. RESULTS: Preliminary searches conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE retrieved 1820 and 2322 results, respectively. The scoping review will be completed by January 2018. CONCLUSIONS: The scoping review will be the first to map the extent and range of PCIs currently available across the United Kingdom, United States, and Japan, and will be the first review to contribute to a better understanding of what PCIs patients may benefit from. Researchers and practitioners will be able to use information in this review as a guide for patients and also as a guide for the development of future tools and programs. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.",6,12,e245,,Medical research; Psychology; Health care; Patient participation; Research participant; MEDLINE; Data sharing; Protocol (science); Medical education; Grey literature,data sharing; digital technology; dynamic consent; patient empowerment; patient engagement; patient participation; patient public involvement; research participant,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://core.ac.uk/display/145643096 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1285709-participant-centric-initiatives-and-medical-research--scoping-review-protocol https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/811000 https://www.researchprotocols.org/2017/12/e245 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5743923 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5743923 https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/publications/811000 https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/items/891d9a24-4c86-4fdd-9079-cd8d4eba4251/1/ https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/file/891d9a24-4c86-4fdd-9079-cd8d4eba4251/1/Participant-centric initiatives - 2017 - Coathup et al.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29233800/ https://www.researchprotocols.org/article/citations/7407,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/resprot.7407,29233800,10.2196/resprot.7407,2773905952,PMC5743923,0,001-029-395-950-954; 001-399-080-329-598; 002-378-823-460-356; 004-613-862-207-388; 005-460-370-362-498; 006-306-535-190-681; 010-222-991-684-139; 010-963-478-093-707; 011-780-619-035-83X; 012-772-391-316-155; 013-699-594-985-621; 017-300-737-144-757; 017-332-092-657-286; 026-835-529-925-425; 036-148-257-435-606; 059-011-618-819-240; 072-105-898-593-423; 076-117-492-776-557; 087-059-521-906-418; 127-245-670-262-773; 130-726-254-532-485; 135-805-472-691-377; 136-147-602-351-86X; 136-602-474-381-694,2

Jones; Darren L. Roberts; Anne Lützen; Anders Lundby; Jesper Worm; Bo Falck Hansen; Andrew G Renehan,"Epidemiological and laboratory studies raise the possibility of a link between clinically prescribed insulin analogues and increased cancer risk. Accordingly, there is a regulatory mandate for cancer-related pre-clinical safety evaluation during insulin analogue development, but currently, there is no standardized framework for such in vitro evaluation. We tested human insulin; the super-mitogenic insulin, X10 and insulin-like growth factor I, in four cancer cell lines with a range of insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)/IR (insulin receptor) ratios (HCT 116, HT-29, COLO 205 and MCF7) and related these to IGF-IR and IR expression in 17 human adenocarcinomas. All cell types were IR-A isoform dominant. We determined IGF-IR/IR signalling pathway endpoints in dose- and time-varying experiments, and performed mitogenic dose–response equivalent assays to derive EC50 values, and correlated these with IGF-IR/IR ratios. We superimposed relative EC50 values onto data from the literature in a meta-analysis. The IGF-IR/IR ratios varied from <1 to 12 in the selected cell lines; similar pattern ranges were observed in human adenocarcinomas. The three ligands demonstrated differential IR/IGF-IR and Akt phosphorylation, which correlated with cell-specific IGF-IR/IR ratios. Mitogenic profiles of X10 mimicked those for insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and correlated with IGF-IR/IR ratios. The meta-analysis, adding data from five additional studies, supported the hypothesis that ligand mitogenic potency, relative to human insulin, increases with increasing cell-specific IGF-IR/IR ratio. This study established a framework for the in vitro evaluation of cancer-relevant bioassays for comparisons of insulin analogues, and specifically consolidated earlier studies that determination of the cell-specific IGF-IR/IR ratio is crucial for the interpretation of ranking relative biological activities.",36,9,1040,1050,Insulin receptor; Internal medicine; Endocrinology; Receptor; In vitro; Growth factor; Insulin; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Signal transduction; Biology; EC50,,"Adenocarcinoma/pathology; Apoptosis/genetics; Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology; Cell Line, Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms/epidemiology; Female; HCT116 Cells; HT29 Cells; Humans; Insulin/analogs & derivatives; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/biosynthesis; MCF-7 Cells; Phosphorylation; Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism; Receptor, IGF Type 1/genetics; Receptor, Insulin/biosynthesis; Signal Transduction","IGF1 protein, human; Insulin; Protein Isoforms; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Receptor, IGF Type 1; Receptor, Insulin; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt",Medical Research Council (MC_PC_13042) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K006665/1) United Kingdom,https://paperity.org/p/73762031/a-framework-for-the-in-vitro-evaluation-of-cancer-relevant-molecular-characteristics-and http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4552242 https://www.science-open.com/document_file/45424a42-ba3f-48e8-99cb-7e136d169b92/PubMedCentral/45424a42-ba3f-48e8-99cb-7e136d169b92.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4552242/ https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-framework-for-the-in-vitro-evaluation-of-cancerrelevant-molecular-characteristics-and-mitogenic-potency-of-insulin-analogues(61520b6e-ba74-47e0-8db7-0553d27f79a8).html https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:270758 https://christie.openrepository.com/handle/10541/558712 https://academic.oup.com/carcin/article/36/9/1040/474434,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/carcin/bgv071,26026165,10.1093/carcin/bgv071,2117591489,PMC4552242,2,002-771-984-019-300; 008-910-012-069-165; 008-973-304-894-819; 009-290-698-839-786; 010-983-938-942-166; 011-036-215-198-194; 014-975-983-420-194; 015-390-728-498-675; 015-735-483-183-966; 017-054-194-428-815; 018-008-765-346-776; 019-944-262-651-128; 024-413-935-612-667; 024-638-689-329-977; 024-802-869-795-870; 025-366-581-495-869; 026-666-920-969-469; 027-271-451-227-859; 027-997-807-168-961; 028-963-491-966-107; 030-040-442-848-610; 032-347-758-198-625; 033-261-439-589-003; 035-727-209-010-697; 040-664-545-324-404; 041-775-842-314-307; 044-646-927-040-251; 045-827-237-477-711; 049-618-794-332-800; 052-863-345-415-587; 053-750-018-277-506; 054-995-212-428-197; 062-885-651-272-350; 064-519-441-822-943; 066-786-730-643-457; 084-693-334-105-913; 088-230-126-103-950; 088-866-443-930-216; 094-490-013-985-078; 099-357-676-129-773; 109-000-851-435-225; 118-281-092-789-435; 124-692-620-625-148; 134-767-846-884-448; 145-687-444-881-673; 165-296-284-618-24X,12

This paper describes in situ meteorological forcing and evaluation data, and; bias-corrected reanalysis forcing data, for cold regions' modelling at 10; sites. The long-term datasets (one maritime, one arctic, three boreal, and; five mid-latitude alpine) are the reference sites chosen for evaluating; models participating in the Earth System Model-Snow Model Intercomparison; Project. Periods covered by the in situ data vary between 7 and 20 years of hourly meteorological data, with evaluation data (snow depth, snow; water equivalent, albedo, soil temperature, and surface temperature); available at varying temporal intervals. Thirty-year (1980–2010) time series; have been extracted from a global gridded surface meteorology dataset; (Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3) for the grid cells containing the; reference sites, interpolated to 1 h time steps and bias-corrected.; Although the correction was applied to all sites, it was most important for; mountain sites hundreds of metres higher than the grid elevations and for; which uncorrected air temperatures were too high and snowfall amounts too; low. The discussion considers the importance of data sharing to the; identification of errors and how the publication of these datasets; contributes to good practice, consistency, and reproducibility in; geosciences. The Supplement provides information on instrumentation,; an estimate of the percentages of missing values, and gap-filling methods at; each site. It is hoped that these datasets will be used as benchmarks for; future model development and that their ease of use and availability will; help model developers quantify model uncertainties and reduce model errors.; The data are published in the repository PANGAEA and are available at;  https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.897575 .",11,2,865,880,Meteorology; Grid; Snow; Forcing (mathematics); Data sharing; Environmental science; Arctic; Earth system science; Albedo; Missing data,,,,Natural Environment Research Council,https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/meteorological-and-evaluation-datasets-for-snow-modelling-at-ten- https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/meteorological-and-evaluation-datasets-for-snow-modelling-at-10-reference-sites-description-of-in-situ-and-biascorrected-reanalysis-data(df60a060-98e3-4aa4-b58c-de15f50238f3).html https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/11/865/2019/essd-11-865-2019-discussion.html http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ESSD...11..865M/abstract https://www.earth-syst-sci-data-discuss.net/essd-2019-12/ https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/11/865/2019/essd-11-865-2019.pdf https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/wsl/islandora/object/wsl%3A20203/ https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/11/865/2019/essd-11-865-2019-metrics.html https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/11/865/2019/ https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/95013119/80584218._Cecile._PFV.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/224804327.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-11-865-2019,,10.5194/essd-11-865-2019,2912584414,,0,000-410-783-897-813; 002-334-198-161-873; 003-685-090-246-171; 011-219-541-349-930; 011-728-155-176-686; 014-475-705-606-545; 014-820-953-555-470; 015-426-050-716-422; 020-690-167-269-180; 023-354-499-827-739; 027-984-284-102-740; 028-708-660-513-734; 029-441-217-862-055; 034-004-828-999-849; 035-681-817-935-692; 042-801-427-008-321; 042-907-642-283-962; 044-872-364-274-518; 046-307-206-286-899; 049-898-881-273-510; 061-500-116-137-310; 062-688-945-326-956; 068-633-697-818-977; 069-542-809-694-095; 075-705-691-810-10X; 084-390-146-635-396; 096-925-748-173-161; 099-005-131-825-091; 103-395-853-608-40X; 105-040-776-125-307; 106-307-227-642-527; 110-553-101-446-06X; 118-679-135-207-627; 133-316-049-433-223; 136-334-982-258-731; 137-306-772-742-961; 147-606-163-114-596; 165-597-118-808-493; 169-030-989-346-026; 178-348-684-531-382; 191-803-050-078-558,17

As this reality approaches, questions on the importance of public trust arise. The success of genomic medicine initiatives is influenced by the public’s trust and willingness to engage. Specific social actors influential in the public's trust have been identified by the “Your DNA, Your Say” study, including doctors, researchers, and governments. This paper aims to identify and examine which specific social actors, if any, in Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) are the most trustworthy and influential to engage the public in genomic medicine research. Methods: Using data from the ‘Your DNA, Your Say’ study, logistic regression models and Pearson’s chi-square tests were conducted to explore trust in social actors across Canada and the UK. Results: The results demonstrate Canada and the UK significantly differ in public trust and willingness to donate. Non-profit researchers, domestic doctors, and personal doctors were identified to be the most influential and trustworthy social actors in Canada and the UK. Conclusions: The comparative results indicate that both countries would benefit from engaging the public through doctors and non-profit researchers. The UK could additionally support public trust by engaging with the public through the National Health Service. However, the results suggest that whilst public trust is significant, it may be neither necessary nor sufficient in influencing willingness to donate. Future research could do well to investigate how the importance of public trust compares in countries with lower public trust.",6,,124,,Logistic regression; Trustworthiness; Political science; Public trust; Disease; Data sharing; National health service; Genomic medicine; Personalized medicine; Public relations; Internet privacy; Political science; Public trust; Data sharing; Genomic medicine; Personalized medicine,Canada; United Kingdom; data sharing; genomic medicine; genomics; personalised medicine; personalized medicine; public trust,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-124/v1/xml https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8215560 https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR364491 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-124 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-124/v2/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16831.2,34235273,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16831.2,3163239123; 3178871943,PMC8215560,0,002-233-715-333-627; 003-669-879-701-397; 006-870-294-856-338; 006-991-949-353-784; 008-387-625-827-965; 008-393-874-259-429; 010-069-651-197-985; 011-164-146-144-323; 013-049-925-680-431; 016-605-977-557-201; 030-305-706-347-985; 036-138-700-226-851; 042-558-635-197-000; 048-571-723-650-076; 050-335-822-156-230; 051-835-687-175-072; 051-885-200-969-600; 054-268-565-502-005; 058-373-877-315-161; 060-361-195-577-432; 061-542-787-935-028; 064-534-417-580-572; 084-278-244-981-225; 088-360-660-662-782; 113-637-801-125-520; 115-518-669-480-656; 122-325-601-542-972; 123-185-302-096-110; 162-725-859-796-180; 166-069-251-031-940,0

Pursuing a strategy of evidence-based decision-making and using tools such as Health Technology Assessment (HTA), can help address issues relating to both affordability and equity when allocating resources. Three BRICS and Global South countries, China, India and South Africa have committed to strengthening HTA capacity and developing their domestic HTA systems, with the goal of getting evidence translated into policy. Through assessing and comparing the HTA journey of each country it may be possible to identify common problems and shareable insights. OBJECTIVES: This collaborative paper aimed to share knowledge on strengthening HTA systems to enable enhanced evidence-based decision-making in the Global South by: Identifying common barriers and enablers in three BRICS countries in the Global South; and Exploring how South-South collaboration can strengthen HTA capacity and utilisation for better healthcare decision-making. METHODS: A descriptive and explorative comparative analysis was conducted comprising a Within-Case analysis to produce a narrative of the HTA journey in each country and an Across-Case analysis to explore both knowledge that could be shared and any potential knowledge gaps. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that China, India and South Africa share many barriers to strengthening and developing HTA systems such as: (1) Minimal HTA expertise; (2) Weak health data infrastructure; (3) Rising healthcare costs; (4) Fragmented healthcare systems; and (5) Significant growth in non-communicable diseases. Stakeholder engagement and institutionalisation of HTA were identified as two conducive factors for strengthening HTA systems. CONCLUSION: China, India and South Africa have all committed to establishing robust HTA systems to inform evidence-based priority setting and have experienced similar challenges.

Thera; Dominic P. Kwiatkowski; Michael Parker; Ogobara K. Doumbo,"Background: Obtaining informed consent for participation in genomic research in low-income settings presents specific ethical issues requiring attention. These include the challenges that arise when providing information about unfamiliar and technical research methods, the implications of complicated infrastructure and data sharing requirements, and the potential consequences of future research with samples and data. This study investigated researchers’ and participants’ parents’ experiences of a consent process and understandings of a genome-wide association study of malaria involving children aged five and under in Mali. It aimed to inform best practices in recruiting participants into genomic research. Methods: A qualitative rapid ethical assessment was undertaken. Fifty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted with the parents of research participants. An additional nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with senior research scientists, research assistants and with a member of an ethics committee. A focus group with five parents of research participants and direct observations of four consent processes were also conducted. French and translated English transcripts were descriptively and thematically coded using OpenCode software. Results: Participants’ parents in the MalariaGEN study had differing understandings of the causes of malaria, the rationale for collecting blood samples, the purposes of the study and the kinds of information the study would generate. Genomic aspects of the research, including the gene/environment interaction underlying susceptibility or resistance to severe malaria, proved particularly challenging to explain and understand. Conclusions: This study identifies a number of areas to be addressed in the design of consent processes for genomic research, some of which require careful ethical analysis. These include determining how much information should be provided about differing aspects of the research and how best to promote understandings of genomic research. We conclude that it is important to build capacity in the design and conduct of effective and appropriate consent processes for genomic research in low and middle-income settings. Additionally, consideration should be given to the role of review committees and community consultation activities in protecting the interests of participants in genomic research.",16,1,42,42,Philosophy of medicine; Research ethics; Psychology; Bioethics; Qualitative research; Therapeutic misconception; Research design; Medical education; Management science; Focus group; Informed consent,,"Adult; Biomedical Research/ethics; Child, Preschool; Comprehension; Developing Countries; Ethics, Research; Female; Focus Groups; Genome; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics/ethics; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Informed Consent; Malaria/genetics; Male; Mali; Parents; Poverty; Qualitative Research; Research Design; Therapeutic Misconception",,Wellcome Trust (090532/Z/09/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (090770/Z/09/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (096527) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT077383/Z/05/Z) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0600718) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (087285) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M006212/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (098051) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (090770) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26077875 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12910-015-0035-7.pdf https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-015-0035-7 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-015-0035-7 https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-015-0035-7?optIn=true https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26077875/ https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/533904 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/533904 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-015-0035-7/fulltext.html https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/533904 https://core.ac.uk/display/81079615 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4469103/ https://philpapers.org/rec/TRAUOG,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-015-0035-7,26077875,10.1186/s12910-015-0035-7,1511875347,PMC4469103,0,004-306-915-294-949; 005-012-445-454-882; 005-016-317-642-924; 006-163-147-328-401; 006-897-765-523-020; 010-573-184-794-352; 011-740-961-719-640; 012-524-522-636-19X; 015-372-125-330-436; 015-761-762-235-078; 021-862-840-020-92X; 021-928-690-662-300; 029-905-296-711-097; 030-412-132-629-193; 031-863-674-953-616; 033-251-422-708-716; 036-138-099-943-445; 039-433-883-997-392; 039-981-143-986-740; 040-909-082-146-551; 041-351-846-842-204; 042-674-373-967-21X; 043-238-582-252-339; 043-461-666-754-223; 045-393-570-934-511; 051-246-166-501-244; 053-697-403-010-226; 055-806-766-170-379; 067-614-735-291-118; 069-029-068-683-235; 070-856-262-579-620; 076-111-448-521-699; 081-398-140-756-450; 088-496-221-012-043; 090-276-752-138-558; 109-577-063-176-767; 118-788-888-495-400; 121-832-153-620-200; 130-804-741-582-878; 135-229-675-420-590; 151-048-766-958-705; 166-968-590-450-006; 169-210-266-310-204,13

The inclusion of the CDISC SDTM clinical data standard into the tranSMART i2b2 via a guiding master ontology tree positively impacts and supports the efficacy of data sharing, visualization and exploration across datasets. Results We present here a schema for the organization of SDTM variables into the tranSMART i2b2 tree along with a script and test dataset to exemplify the mapping strategy. The eTRIKS master tree concept is demonstrated by making use of fictitious data generated for four patients, including 16 SDTM clinical domains. We describe how the usage of correct visit names and data labels can help to integrate multiple readouts per patient and avoid ETL crashes when running a tranSMART loading routine.

ObjectivesClinical imaging data are essential for developing research software for computer-aided diagnosis, treatment planning and image-guided surgery, yet existing systems are poorly suited for data sharing between healthcare and academia: research systems rarely provide an integrated approach for data exchange with clinicians; hospital systems are focused towards clinical patient care with limited access for external researchers; and safe haven environments are not well suited to algorithm development. We have established GIFT-Cloud, a data and medical image sharing platform, to meet the needs of GIFT-Surg, an international research collaboration that is developing novel imaging methods for fetal surgery. GIFT-Cloud also has general applicability to other areas of imaging research. MethodsGIFT-Cloud builds upon well-established cross-platform technologies. The Server provides secure anonymised data storage, direct web-based data access and a REST API for integrating external software. The Uploader provides automated on-site anonymisation, encryption and data upload. Gateways provide a seamless process for uploading medical data from clinical systems to the research server. ResultsGIFT-Cloud has been implemented in a multi-centre study for fetal medicine research. We present a case study of placental segmentation for pre-operative surgical planning, showing how GIFT-Cloud underpins the research and integrates with the clinical workflow. ConclusionsGIFT-Cloud simplifies the transfer of imaging data from clinical to research institutions, facilitating the development and validation of medical research software and the sharing of results back to the clinical partners.

Wong,"Study question  What is the association between clarithromycin use and cardiovascular outcomes? Methods  In this population based study the authors compared cardiovascular outcomes in adults aged 18 or more receiving oral clarithromycin or amoxicillin during 2005-09 in Hong Kong. Based on age within five years, sex, and calendar year at use, each clarithromycin user was matched to one or two amoxicillin users. The cohort analysis included patients who received clarithromycin (n=108 988) or amoxicillin (n=217 793). The self controlled case series and case crossover analysis included those who received Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment containing clarithromycin. The primary outcome was myocardial infarction. Secondary outcomes were all cause, cardiac, or non-cardiac mortality, arrhythmia, and stroke. Study answer and limitations  The propensity score adjusted rate ratio of myocardial infarction 14 days after the start of antibiotic treatment was 3.66 (95% confidence interval 2.82 to 4.76) comparing clarithromycin use (132 events, rate 44.4 per 1000 person years) with amoxicillin use (149 events, 19.2 per 1000 person years), but no long term increased risk was observed. Similarly, rate ratios of secondary outcomes increased significantly only with current use of clarithromycin versus amoxicillin, except for stroke. In the self controlled case analysis, there was an association between current use of H pylori eradication treatment containing clarithromycin and cardiovascular events. The risk returned to baseline after treatment had ended. The case crossover analysis also showed an increased risk of cardiovascular events during current use of H pylori eradication treatment containing clarithromycin. The adjusted absolute risk difference for current use of clarithromycin versus amoxicillin was 1.90 excess myocardial infarction events (95% confidence interval 1.30 to 2.68) per 1000 patients. What this study adds  Current use of clarithromycin was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, and cardiac mortality short term but no association with long term cardiovascular risks among the Hong Kong population.

Over the last decade an increasing share of biological experiments involve multiple technologies assaying different biological modalities, such as epigenetics, and RNA and protein expression, and thus the BioStudies database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies) was established to deal with such multimodal data. Its central concept is a study, which typically is associated with a publication. BioStudies stores metadata describing the study, provides links to the relevant databases, such as European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), as well as hosts the types of data for which specialized databases do not exist. With BioStudies now fully functional, we are able to further harmonize the archival data infrastructure at EMBL-EBI, and ArrayExpress is being migrated to BioStudies. In future, all functional genomics data will be archived at BioStudies. The process will be seamless for the users, who will continue to submit data using the online tool Annotare and will be able to query and download data largely in the same manner as before.

Sydes; Anthony L. Johnson; Sarah Meredith; Mary Rauchenberger; Annabelle South; Mahesh K. B. Parmar,"The move towards increased transparency around clinical trials is welcome. Much focus has been on under-reporting of trials and access to individual patient data to allow independent verification of findings. There are many other good reasons for data sharing from clinical trials. We describe some key issues in data sharing, including the challenges of open access to data. These include issues in consent and disclosure; risks in identification, including self-identification; risks in distorting data to prevent self-identification; and risks in analysis. These risks have led us to develop a controlled access policy, which safeguards the rights of patients entered in our trials, guards the intellectual property rights of the original researchers who designed the trial and collected the data, provides a barrier against unnecessary duplication, and ensures that researchers have the necessary resources and skills to analyse the data. We briefly discuss the practicalities of our current approach to data sharing, including ensuring that data are discoverable and how to deal with old studies. We describe data sharing activities at the MRC Clinical Trials Unit. One hundred and three data sharing activities were logged from 2012 to 2014 from external and internal applicants. The motivations are varied, but none have been for replication of the primary results. For any request to share data, we note the important role of independent reviewers as well as reviewers who know the study well, and present some of the key questions that all reviewers should ask when deciding whether a request is reasonable. We consider the responsibilities of all parties. We highlight the potential for opportunity costs.

Rennick; Gillian Colville; Neethi Pinto; Asam Latif; Emma Popejoy; Jane Coad,"Introduction Annually in the UK, 20 000 children become very ill or injured and need specialist care within a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Most children survive. However, some children and their families may experience problems after they have left the PICU including physical, functional and/or emotional problems. It is unknown which children and families experience such problems, when these occur or what causes them. The aim of this mixed-method longitudinal cohort study is to understand the physical, functional, emotional and social impact of children surviving PICU (aged: 1 month–17 years), their parents and siblings, during the first year after a PICU admission. Methods and analysis A quantitative study involving 300 child survivors of PICU; 300 parents; and 150–300 siblings will collect data (using self-completion questionnaires) at baseline, PICU discharge, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-PICU discharge. Questionnaires will comprise validated and reliable instruments. Demographic data, PICU admission and treatment data, health-related quality of life, functional status, strengths and difficulties behaviour and post-traumatic stress symptoms will be collected from the child. Parent and sibling data will be collected on the impact of paediatric health conditions on the family’s functioning capabilities, levels of anxiety and social impact of the child’s PICU admission. Data will be analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Concurrently, an embedded qualitative study involving semistructured interviews with 24 enrolled families at 3 months and 9 months post-PICU discharge will be undertaken. Framework analysis will be used to analyse the qualitative data.

Winkler,"The ENIGMA group on Generalized Anxiety Disorder (ENIGMA-Anxiety/GAD) is part of a broader effort to investigate anxiety disorders using imaging and genetic data across multiple sites worldwide. The group is actively conducting a mega-analysis of a large number of brain structural scans. In this process, the group was confronted with many methodological challenges related to study planning and implementation, between-country transfer of subject-level data, quality control of a considerable amount of imaging data, and choices related to statistical methods and efficient use of resources. This report summarizes the background information and rationale for the various methodological decisions, as well as the approach taken to implement them. The goal is to document the approach and help guide other research groups working with large brain imaging data sets as they develop their own analytic pipelines for mega-analyses.",43,1,255,277,Psychology;

Smith; Rebecca M. Pearson; Laura Johnson; Louise A C Millard; Nashita Patel; Andrew L. Skinner; Kate Tilling,"Background: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children-Generation 2 (ALSPAC-G2) was set up to provide a unique multi-generational cohort. It builds on the existing ALSPAC resource, which recruited 14,541 pregnancies to women resident in the South West of England who were expected to deliver between 01/04/1991 and 31/12/1992. Those women and their partners (Generation 0; ALSPAC-G0) and their offspring (ALSPAC-G1) have been followed for the last 26 years. This profile describes recruitment and data collection on the next generation (ALSPAC-G2)-the grandchildren of ALSPAC-G0 and children of ALSPAC-G1. Recruitment: Recruitment began on the 6 th of June 2012 and we present details of recruitment and participants up to 30 th June 2018 (~6 years). We knew at the start of recruitment that some ALSPAC-G1 participants had already become parents and ALSPAC-G2 is an open cohort; we recruit at any age. We hope to continue recruiting until all ALSPAC-G1 participants have completed their families. Up to 30 th June 2018 we recruited 810 ALSPAC-G2 participants from 548 families. Of these 810, 389 (48%) were recruited during their mother's pregnancy, 287 (35%) before age 3 years, 104 (13%) between 3-6 years and 30 (4%) after 6 years. Over 70% of those invited to early pregnancy, late pregnancy, second week of life, 6-, 12- and 24-month assessments (whether for their recruitment, or a follow-up, visit) have attended, with attendance being over 60% for subsequent visits up to 7 years (to few are eligible for the 9- and 11-year assessments to analyse).

Given China’s rapid urbanisation, scale and global importance in climate mitigation, this study investigates how evidence is perceived and used to inform urban health and sustainability policies at central and local levels. Well-informed senior professionals in government/scientific agencies (12 in Beijing and 11 in Ningbo) were interviewed. A thematic analysis is presented using deductive and inductive coding. Government agency participants described formal remits and processes determining the scope and use of evidence by different tiers of government. Academic evidence was influential when commissioned by government departments. Public opinion and economic priorities were two factors that also influenced the use or weight of evidence in policymaking. This study shows that scientific evidence produced or commissioned by government was routinely used to inform urban health and sustainability policy. Extensive and routine data collection is regularly used to inform cyclical policy processes, which improves adaptive capacity. This study contributes to knowledge on the ‘cultures of evidence use’. Environmental governance can be further improved through increased data-sharing and use of diverse knowledge types. Policy relevance • Insights are provided into the ‘cultures of evidence use’ in urban sustainability and health governance in two Chinese cities, noting the complex interconnections between national policy agendas, the public and evidence. Policies are centrally led and informed by officially commissioned scientific evidence. • Environmental health data were used for monitoring policy implementation, and they were interpreted with careful consideration of public opinion and economic priorities. • There were opportunities for local priorities to shift the policy agenda, particularly when the public became aware of a specific environmental health threat. • Environmental governance could be strengthened in these settings through increased cross-sector data-sharing and integration of diverse knowledge types. • A strength of China’s approach is routine data collection that feeds a monitoring and policy cycle rarely achieved elsewhere. This cycle provides feedback to government departments, allows policy adjustment over time and can inform decisions during crises.",2,1,550,567,Scientific evidence; Public opinion; Government; Political science; Evidence-based policy; Environmental governance; National Policy; Public administration; Sustainable development; Sustainability,China; cities; environmental risks; evidence-based policy; governance; public health; sustainability; urban health,,,Wellcome Trust (209387) United Kingdom,https://journal-buildingscities.org/article/10.5334/bc.90/ https://journal-buildingscities.org/articles/10.5334/bc.90/galley/148/download/,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bc.90,34853832,10.5334/bc.90,3174373135,PMC7612054,0,000-211-255-897-156; 003-749-739-046-992; 007-711-080-482-041; 008-173-192-859-828; 008-379-278-742-27X; 008-432-267-002-719; 010-764-363-367-999; 011-778-290-502-558; 011-843-341-892-006; 012-095-849-999-846; 012-967-814-771-003; 014-323-327-058-429; 015-504-387-224-598; 015-568-571-772-802; 020-159-183-733-098; 021-204-285-918-727; 027-585-013-751-513; 028-923-245-216-021; 032-311-335-447-912; 034-307-095-360-981; 037-887-612-105-755; 044-605-961-675-559; 047-035-025-248-324; 047-835-359-421-313; 050-995-672-107-372; 055-264-022-223-446; 058-867-322-457-449; 061-116-539-091-59X; 063-371-431-638-339; 063-741-250-362-439; 067-202-917-943-892; 068-634-840-255-420; 074-818-542-581-90X; 079-959-771-575-205; 081-865-561-832-706; 082-956-646-700-761; 085-273-498-575-140; 086-855-272-784-229; 104-809-483-205-155; 107-588-055-174-578; 110-837-377-301-624; 113-381-263-271-54X; 114-977-859-869-431; 116-846-873-777-317; 118-659-531-067-162; 131-771-186-680-150; 139-385-114-438-002; 172-681-306-545-358,2

Vallabhaneni,"Introduction In one-third of all abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), the aneurysm neck is short (juxtarenal) or shows other adverse anatomical features rendering operations more complex, hazardous and expensive. Surgical options include open surgical repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) techniques including fenestrated EVAR, EVAR with adjuncts (chimneys/endoanchors) and off-label standard EVAR. The aim of the UK COMPlex AneurySm Study (UK-COMPASS) is to answer the research question identified by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA) Programme: ‘What is the clinical and cost-effectiveness of strategies for the management of juxtarenal AAA, including fenestrated endovascular repair?’ Methods and analysis UK-COMPASS is a cohort study comparing clinical and cost-effectiveness of different strategies used to manage complex AAAs with stratification of physiological fitness and anatomical complexity, with statistical correction for baseline risk and indication biases. There are two data streams. First, a stream of routinely collected data from Hospital Episode Statistics and National Vascular Registry (NVR). Preoperative CT scans of all patients who underwent elective AAA repair in England between 1 November 2017 and 31 October 2019 are subjected to Corelab analysis to accurately identify and include every complex aneurysm treated. Second, a site-reported data stream regarding quality of life and treatment costs from prospectively recruited patients across England. Site recruitment also includes patients with complex aneurysms larger than 55 mm diameter in whom an operation is deferred (medical management). The primary outcome measure is perioperative all-cause mortality. Follow-up will be to a median of 5 years. Ethics and dissemination The study has received full regulatory approvals from a Research Ethics Committee, the Confidentiality Advisory Group and the Health Research Authority. Data sharing agreements are in place with National Health Service Digital and the NVR. Dissemination will be via NIHR HTA reporting, peer-reviewed journals and conferences.

Design and methods This was a consensus-building process among the members of a multistakeholder task force, involving a wide range of experts (researchers, patient representatives, methodologists, information technology experts, and representatives from funders, infrastructures and standards development organisations). An independent facilitator supported the process using the nominal group technique. The consensus was reached in a series of three workshops held over 1 year, supported by exchange of documents and teleconferences within focused subgroups when needed. This work was set within the Horizon 2020-funded project CORBEL (Coordinated Research Infrastructures Building Enduring Life-science Services) and coordinated by the European Clinical Research Infrastructure Network. Thus, the focus was on non-commercial trials and the perspective mainly European. Outcome We developed principles and practical recommendations on how to share data from clinical trials. Results The task force reached consensus on 10 principles and 50 recommendations, representing the fundamental requirements of any framework used for the sharing of clinical trials data. The document covers the following main areas: making data sharing a reality (eg, cultural change, academic incentives, funding), consent for data sharing, protection of trial participants (eg, de-identification), data standards, rights, types and management of access (eg, data request and access models), data management and repositories, discoverability, and metadata. Conclusions The adoption of the recommendations in this document would help to promote and support data sharing and reuse among researchers, adequately inform trial participants and protect their rights, and provide effective and efficient systems for preparing, storing and accessing data. The recommendations now need to be implemented and tested in practice. Further work needs to be done to integrate these proposals with those from other geographical areas and other academic domains.",7,12,e018647,,Information technology; Data management; Facilitator; Discoverability; Data sharing; Clinical trial; Knowledge management; Nominal group technique; Medicine; Metadata,clinical trials; consensus conference; data sharing; individual participant data,Advisory Committees; Biomedical Research/standards; Clinical Trials as Topic; Consensus; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods,,World Health Organization (001) International; Medical Research Council (MR/K025635/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L004933/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L004933/2) United Kingdom,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29247106 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10040511/ https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/12/e018647 https://repositorium.meduniwien.ac.at/obvumwoa/content/titleinfo/5972067?lang=en https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/34651803 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/12/e018647 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5736032 https://core.ac.uk/display/151185168 https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3017641/ http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/12/e018647.full.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/151185168.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018647,29247106,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018647,2773899110,PMC5736032,0,001-223-855-651-349; 002-952-941-084-885; 003-056-329-082-833; 007-242-464-566-106; 008-311-883-428-069; 009-277-508-042-519; 009-816-707-250-337; 010-390-238-561-510; 012-351-385-183-880; 016-245-737-034-27X; 018-302-229-584-954; 023-982-034-841-976; 030-914-574-781-053; 031-112-391-813-544; 032-396-624-356-991; 033-446-879-605-573; 034-548-036-987-474; 043-968-124-695-612; 045-171-039-374-851; 045-460-046-575-994; 047-465-211-550-666; 048-848-965-957-782; 048-912-199-333-412; 054-576-660-798-697; 058-439-499-212-198; 059-402-420-924-609; 065-837-237-986-879; 069-436-879-127-927; 074-614-949-934-346; 077-433-286-546-022; 084-118-472-094-473; 085-156-293-600-063; 086-470-411-539-657; 089-089-909-971-945; 098-422-711-641-097; 101-040-680-646-444; 114-009-639-453-938; 140-205-602-446-786; 142-302-398-238-628; 145-028-004-871-587; 150-085-629-478-541; 170-305-757-925-083; 177-729-381-638-505; 182-432-846-176-608; 186-670-491-897-885,91

Objective: Our objective was to produce an evidence-based, theory-informed, and pragmatic framework to help predict and evaluate the success of a technology-supported health or social care program. Methods: The study had 2 parallel components: (1) secondary research (hermeneutic systematic review) to identify key domains, and (2) empirical case studies of technology implementation to explore, test, and refine these domains. We studied 6 technology-supported programs-video outpatient consultations, global positioning system tracking for cognitive impairment, pendant alarm services, remote biomarker monitoring for heart failure, care organizing software, and integrated case management via data sharing-using longitudinal ethnography and action research for up to 3 years across more than 20 organizations. Data were collected at micro level (individual technology users), meso level (organizational processes and systems), and macro level (national policy and wider context). Analysis and synthesis was aided by sociotechnically informed theories of individual, organizational, and system change. The draft framework was shared with colleagues who were introducing or evaluating other technology-supported health or care programs and refined in response to feedback. Results: The literature review identified 28 previous technology implementation frameworks, of which 14 had taken a dynamic systems approach (including 2 integrative reviews of previous work). Our empirical dataset consisted of over 400 hours of ethnographic observation, 165 semistructured interviews, and 200 documents. The final nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework included questions in 7 domains: the condition or illness, the technology, the value proposition, the adopter system (comprising professional staff, patient, and lay caregivers), the organization(s), the wider (institutional and societal) context, and the interaction and mutual adaptation between all these domains over time. Our empirical case studies raised a variety of challenges across all 7 domains, each classified as simple (straightforward, predictable, few components), complicated (multiple interacting components or issues), or complex (dynamic, unpredictable, not easily disaggregated into constituent components). Programs characterized by complicatedness proved difficult but not impossible to implement. Those characterized by complexity in multiple NASSS domains rarely, if ever, became mainstreamed. The framework showed promise when applied (both prospectively and retrospectively) to other programs. Conclusions: Subject to further empirical testing, NASSS could be applied across a range of technological innovations in health and social care. It has several potential uses: (1) to inform the design of a new technology; (2) to identify technological solutions that (perhaps despite policy or industry enthusiasm) have a limited chance of achieving large-scale, sustained adoption; (3) to plan the implementation, scale-up, or rollout of a technology program; and (4) to explain and learn from program failures.",19,11,e367,,Empirical research; Variety (cybernetics); Psychology; Secondary research; Abandonment (legal); Context (language use); Action research; Knowledge management; Sustainability; Value proposition,"NASSS framework; business planning; complexity of innovations; diffusion of innovation; implementation; innovation adoption; nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, sustainability framework; program sustainability; scale-up",Delivery of Health Care/methods; Humans; Technology/methods,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Department of Health (RP-DG-1213-10003) United Kingdom,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.8775 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5688245 https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.8775 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29092808/ https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5688245 https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e367/ https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/publications/742561 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/96143/ https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/handle/2299/19495?show=full https://core.ac.uk/display/141439506 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5688245 https://core.ac.uk/download/132205466.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/jmir.8775,29092808,10.2196/jmir.8775,2765304416,PMC5688245,0,000-145-523-689-087; 000-512-206-953-173; 001-883-508-652-99X; 002-112-639-114-420; 002-882-688-490-597; 003-267-324-409-067; 003-382-589-177-947; 003-443-080-551-429; 003-499-639-959-12X; 005-073-996-346-668; 006-870-619-233-308; 007-109-348-692-727; 007-981-950-131-190; 008-320-549-229-704; 010-017-995-208-604; 010-466-848-259-114; 010-769-298-335-589; 011-791-706-025-449; 012-629-774-121-337; 013-785-284-799-410; 015-641-767-600-277; 016-243-432-897-403; 018-054-684-557-907; 019-877-479-596-679; 020-950-184-908-122; 021-743-191-106-368; 021-781-343-202-103; 022-236-067-989-327; 022-452-056-842-588; 025-570-876-782-273; 026-002-179-394-284; 026-217-890-236-50X; 026-562-754-006-539; 027-335-780-598-36X; 028-560-070-695-752; 029-565-600-674-457; 029-579-488-609-168; 030-143-478-703-378; 031-219-313-226-264; 031-915-263-061-009; 032-021-671-422-786; 032-459-976-472-780; 034-484-289-593-756; 034-772-039-974-851; 038-009-809-727-715; 039-286-924-700-616; 039-986-147-676-099; 041-512-060-123-667; 041-943-151-337-489; 042-365-162-231-668; 043-237-753-368-420; 043-819-331-111-617; 045-645-142-208-407; 046-545-708-093-388; 046-987-785-743-397; 052-002-629-137-81X; 053-206-548-028-057; 054-248-664-461-706; 054-483-046-197-004; 055-198-615-448-699; 055-608-853-348-019; 056-718-765-609-315; 056-940-970-462-479; 057-454-308-169-000; 057-790-656-669-16X; 058-157-765-117-877; 059-028-701-644-85X; 060-914-369-636-250; 061-693-682-565-049; 061-998-669-414-358; 063-570-732-987-868; 064-749-462-579-130; 066-080-000-554-810; 068-712-609-009-148; 069-219-308-846-02X; 072-192-773-035-354; 072-801-370-845-88X; 073-423-059-966-436; 073-927-898-685-466; 074-876-499-491-209; 076-121-422-885-733; 077-346-234-065-707; 078-455-009-415-706; 084-433-360-452-07X; 085-591-865-874-155; 088-013-112-781-100; 090-904-029-230-034; 096-877-177-850-275; 097-203-554-723-593; 097-549-648-438-214; 101-269-626-606-05X; 102-209-767-634-670; 103-109-413-436-472; 105-426-515-656-187; 105-970-875-262-64X; 106-518-329-252-175; 107-460-953-087-297; 108-698-679-262-211; 109-427-615-568-395; 110-671-215-255-808; 113-443-950-523-906; 123-643-234-079-970; 124-824-797-717-875; 125-305-079-071-792; 129-235-839-815-016; 136-108-198-094-045; 144-208-120-032-387; 145-383-596-443-354; 154-724-334-697-177; 168-036-345-097-619; 173-174-852-359-974; 177-515-504-981-896; 192-214-151-913-867; 198-725-359-992-747,644

Private collective organizations face two main challenges: (1) to promote collective innovation while preserving the private interests of the firms within the collective, and (2) to ensure that collective innovation does not weaken healthy competition. Through a case study of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), an exemplary private collective federation of organizations composed of standardization bodies, industry consortia and technology producers, we identify organizational solutions to these challenges. We find that a combination of specific IP rights instruments is key to manage these trade-offs. We also find that the combined policies of essential patenting, FRAND, and maximum royalty rate help overcome the specific challenges associated with collective innovation within competitive contexts. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings for managers and for policy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",34,12,734,745,Economics; Standardization; Digital economy; Face (sociological concept); Competition (economics); Intellectual property; Industrial organization,,,,EPSRC,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/18269/2/Technovation_34_12_2014.pdf https://openresearch.surrey.ac.uk/esploro/outputs/journalArticle/Innovation-policy-within-private-collectives-Evidence/99516492202346 https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/36627 https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/10871/36627/3/TECHNOVATION-S-14-00224%2017April.pdf https://surrey.eprints-hosting.org/810694/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016649721400100X https://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/810694/ https://core.ac.uk/display/42552814 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016649721400100X https://core.ac.uk/download/195277918.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.technovation.2014.07.005,,10.1016/j.technovation.2014.07.005,2042740333,,0,000-432-937-724-374; 001-245-487-294-890; 002-901-442-263-344; 004-136-586-208-595; 004-388-765-492-094; 004-976-577-048-35X; 006-123-363-501-233; 008-206-097-401-091; 009-212-991-307-144; 010-146-194-031-256; 012-178-707-965-636; 012-216-649-437-302; 013-531-466-197-883; 013-619-908-727-383; 015-529-187-246-689; 015-989-959-109-164; 016-242-579-512-059; 016-458-870-279-371; 017-661-304-489-796; 018-010-178-165-762; 018-345-855-897-35X; 018-764-547-512-856; 020-369-463-114-270; 021-657-204-653-416; 025-125-153-558-184; 025-853-859-913-294; 029-977-949-573-14X; 030-289-951-958-715; 031-845-483-793-964; 032-491-612-485-951; 032-764-567-189-424; 033-570-843-579-834; 034-372-082-807-677; 035-583-456-551-319; 035-828-472-328-806; 043-908-141-455-261; 046-142-939-540-134; 047-212-099-142-105; 048-530-103-967-004; 050-571-723-095-078; 053-427-723-981-996; 054-076-838-732-759; 054-172-722-637-143; 054-968-048-204-55X; 055-237-863-950-628; 055-466-167-889-949; 056-745-732-387-860; 061-106-551-419-704; 063-207-591-396-880; 064-565-106-384-912; 073-674-537-757-337; 074-270-476-152-160; 075-165-573-148-624; 075-811-523-793-741; 077-444-831-843-262; 077-636-299-032-901; 080-199-807-404-843; 081-731-396-186-128; 089-007-253-759-455; 090-722-932-967-668; 090-810-566-190-712; 091-941-789-607-139; 092-257-502-174-053; 092-360-702-644-430; 093-646-495-949-409; 096-159-156-822-527; 096-672-030-443-801; 100-659-749-168-974; 101-845-744-748-502; 102-814-259-853-063; 103-070-512-605-176; 108-211-426-261-491; 108-833-328-987-025; 109-213-871-099-424; 109-449-363-209-667; 118-198-561-287-351; 118-795-321-245-318; 122-633-826-346-504; 124-506-476-733-512; 126-167-371-410-53X; 133-009-818-911-112; 140-755-047-290-714; 144-175-351-865-871; 155-343-226-844-86X; 155-848-800-711-433; 157-058-268-340-74X; 157-967-008-294-503; 158-785-343-262-786; 162-098-002-573-906; 164-425-651-574-456; 164-819-891-955-030; 170-492-063-092-060; 175-371-559-758-568; 180-162-557-356-151; 180-391-161-092-400; 182-099-226-776-710; 194-172-212-981-573,41

A citizens' jury study in the UK.,2020-05-26,2020,journal article,Journal of medical ethics,14734257; 03066800,BMJ Publishing Group,United Kingdom,Elizabeth Ford; Malcolm Oswald; Lamiece Hassan; Kyle Bozentko; Goran Nenadic; Jackie Cassell,"Background Use of routinely collected patient data for research and service planning is an explicit policy of the UK National Health Service and UK government. Much clinical information is recorded in free-text letters, reports and notes. These text data are generally lost to research, due to the increased privacy risk compared with structured data. We conducted a citizens’ jury which asked members of the public whether their medical free-text data should be shared for research for public benefit, to inform an ethical policy. Methods Eighteen citizens took part over 3 days. Jurors heard a range of expert presentations as well as arguments for and against sharing free text, and then questioned presenters and deliberated together. They answered a questionnaire on whether and how free text should be shared for research, gave reasons for and against sharing and suggestions for alleviating their concerns. Results Jurors were in favour of sharing medical data and agreed this would benefit health research, but were more cautious about sharing free-text than structured data. They preferred processing of free text where a computer extracted information at scale. Their concerns were lack of transparency in uses of data, and privacy risks. They suggested keeping patients informed about uses of their data, and giving clear pathways to opt out of data sharing. Conclusions Informed citizens suggested a transparent culture of research for the public benefit, and continuous improvement of technology to protect patient privacy, to mitigate their concerns regarding privacy risks of using patient text data.",46,6,367,377,Internet privacy; Government; Psychology; Health care; Medical record; Jury; Citizens' jury; Data sharing; Transparency (behavior); Opt-out,healthcare; medical text; natural language processing; privacy; stakeholder participation; text mining,Electronic Health Records; Humans; Information Dissemination; Privacy; State Medicine; United Kingdom,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/25/medethics-2019-105472 https://jme.bmj.com/content/46/6/367 https://philpapers.org/rec/FORSFD-2 http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/89889/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7279205 https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/46/6/367.full.pdf http://europepmc.org/article/MED/32457202 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/should-freetext-data-in-electronic-medical-records-be-shared-for-research-a-citizens-jury-study-in-the-uk(9f8384ec-daf8-477e-82d3-5b246cbd02a5).html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32457202/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2019-105472,32457202,10.1136/medethics-2019-105472,3028781881,PMC7279205,0,001-140-386-300-410; 001-414-738-968-859; 004-093-142-201-141; 007-279-338-113-543; 007-316-425-658-429; 008-119-655-042-084; 008-419-535-639-040; 012-171-695-701-85X; 012-277-508-841-570; 018-826-197-785-897; 019-368-193-881-110; 020-524-104-037-16X; 021-140-832-808-958; 022-484-361-163-502; 024-949-062-712-727; 030-065-697-283-069; 031-540-312-730-611; 033-765-203-113-032; 033-766-855-075-929; 034-043-472-445-31X; 035-447-488-574-607; 035-774-688-423-799; 036-951-822-986-463; 041-816-561-565-570; 050-988-631-135-953; 054-157-999-318-369; 055-491-337-330-254; 064-890-169-898-725; 065-150-064-642-697; 065-698-954-979-930; 069-755-341-037-75X; 070-978-695-727-209; 073-846-347-920-218; 085-320-250-288-390; 093-508-280-881-00X; 096-307-270-107-908; 096-400-906-507-250; 098-137-362-063-221; 101-670-813-413-289; 107-885-611-527-612; 112-601-696-028-567; 117-458-111-355-857; 122-059-015-538-234; 128-161-709-442-076; 151-192-012-542-881; 155-067-611-296-830; 162-725-859-796-180; 167-040-317-070-844; 173-100-340-070-753; 175-144-541-877-059,11

Our current understanding of human behavior is largely based on static “snapshots” of human behavior, rather than ongoing, dynamic feedback loops of behavior in response to ever-changing biological, social, personal, and environmental states. This paper first discusses how new technologies (i.e., mobile sensors, smartphones, ubiquitous computing, and cloud-enabled processing/computing) and emerging systems modeling techniques enable the development of new, dynamic, and empirical models of human behavior that could facilitate just-in-time adaptive, scalable interventions. The paper then describes concrete steps to the creation of robust dynamic mathematical models of behavior including: (1) establishing “gold standard” measures, (2) the creation of a behavioral ontology for shared language and understanding tools that both enable dynamic theorizing across disciplines, (3) the development of data sharing resources, and (4) facilitating improved sharing of mathematical models and tools to support rapid aggregation of the models. We conclude with the discussion of what might be incorporated into a “knowledge commons,” which could help to bring together these disparate activities into a unified system and structure for organizing knowledge about behavior.",5,3,335,346,Behavior change; Ontology (information science); Ubiquitous computing; Emerging technologies; Data science; Knowledge commons; Connected health; Data sharing; Computer science; Knowledge management; Computational model,Computational models of behavior; Connected health; Health-related behavior; Just-in-time adaptive interventions; Mobile health; Real-time interventions; mHealth,,,Medical Research Council (MR/K023195/1) United Kingdom; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG034546) United States; NCI NIH HHS (P30 CA060553) United States; NIH HHS (R25 OD011113) United States,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-38222-012 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26327939 https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/building-new-computational-models-to-support-health-behavior-chan http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4537459 https://core.ac.uk/display/79496879 https://ohsu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/building-new-computational-models-to-support-health-behavior-chan-2 http://www.academia.edu/18058744/Building_new_computational_models_to_support_health_behavior_change_and_maintenance_new_opportunities_in_behavioral_research https://academic.oup.com/tbm/article/5/3/335/4563109 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13142-015-0324-1 https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/building-new-computational-models-to-support-health-behavior-chan https://www.academia.edu/18058744/Building_new_computational_models_to_support_health_behavior_change_and_maintenance_new_opportunities_in_behavioral_research https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13142-015-0324-1/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13142-015-0324-1 https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/building-new-computational-models-to-support-health-behavior-chan,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13142-015-0324-1,26327939,10.1007/s13142-015-0324-1,359675729,PMC4537459,0,000-220-132-780-550; 000-486-379-277-744; 000-851-690-263-508; 001-056-266-001-561; 001-597-684-747-843; 002-057-150-461-84X; 002-673-692-954-242; 003-082-950-776-533; 003-337-166-503-154; 004-505-080-389-182; 004-719-111-474-51X; 006-189-369-943-632; 006-681-904-876-588; 006-688-766-458-522; 007-812-969-745-494; 008-855-465-457-815; 013-032-395-615-622; 013-934-837-047-718; 014-329-234-324-158; 016-345-093-366-380; 016-394-541-626-678; 017-174-617-959-658; 017-275-375-718-810; 018-026-395-212-621; 018-552-066-929-795; 019-508-432-266-628; 020-214-316-223-024; 022-070-026-159-311; 023-897-360-087-589; 024-580-854-114-488; 025-679-735-885-18X; 025-774-566-921-623; 027-355-601-515-740; 027-963-057-662-155; 028-552-791-576-593; 030-927-038-896-618; 032-641-974-709-116; 032-984-219-033-452; 034-147-730-391-366; 037-062-505-862-252; 037-387-400-464-341; 038-870-664-424-489; 039-335-272-904-282; 039-370-705-928-313; 041-486-755-321-911; 044-273-518-055-998; 045-341-705-978-155; 048-374-094-342-878; 048-686-092-818-572; 048-818-392-457-862; 049-036-986-807-006; 057-107-635-615-534; 063-426-441-526-352; 063-440-015-049-822; 063-960-470-672-818; 064-443-241-151-825; 065-905-609-740-135; 066-301-394-960-833; 069-045-558-172-948; 069-103-703-320-517; 073-949-421-478-061; 076-785-501-039-430; 078-239-966-330-513; 078-481-919-382-834; 080-060-895-359-096; 081-851-626-697-609; 084-727-999-605-86X; 084-991-506-273-426; 092-510-354-361-389; 094-434-426-805-948; 094-659-594-122-756; 095-175-181-835-200; 099-847-511-899-413; 101-102-997-978-093; 106-303-864-490-038; 106-613-919-074-132; 107-006-070-083-612; 110-830-283-741-184; 112-507-063-096-438; 114-139-809-060-121; 116-985-929-549-517; 121-292-450-342-177; 123-170-592-680-216; 130-763-790-078-450; 137-254-833-769-93X; 137-274-511-123-202; 141-412-743-179-966; 144-722-760-957-072; 145-148-841-835-90X; 151-080-930-338-816; 159-077-842-558-812; 170-087-623-834-554,176

The Pediatric Sepsis Predictor Standardization Working Group collaborated to define common data elements for pediatric sepsis predictors at the point of triage to serve as a standardized framework for data collection in resource-limited settings.MethodsA preliminary list of pediatric sepsis predictor variables was compiled through a systematic literature review and examination of global guideline documents. A 5-round modified Delphi that involved independent voting and active group discussions was conducted to select, standardize, and prioritize predictors. Considerations included the perceived predictive value of the candidate predictor at the point of triage, intra- and inter-rater measurement reliability, and the amount of time and material resources required to reliably collect the predictor in resource-limited settings.ResultsWe generated 116 common data elements for implementation in future studies. Each common data element includes a standardized prompt, suggested response values, and prioritization as tier 1 (essential), tier 2 (important), or tier 3 (exploratory). Branching logic was added to the predictors list to facilitate the design of efficient data collection methods, such as low-cost electronic case report forms on a mobile application. The set of common data elements are freely available on the Pediatric Sepsis CoLab Dataverse and a web-based feedback survey is available through the Pediatric Sepsis CoLab. Updated iterations will continuously be released based on feedback from the pediatric sepsis research community and emergence of new information.ConclusionRoutine use of the common data elements in future studies can allow data sharing between studies and contribute to development of powerful risk prediction algorithms. These algorithms may then be used to support clinical decision making at triage in resource-limited settings. Continued collaboration, engagement, and feedback from the pediatric sepsis research community will be important to ensure the common data elements remain applicable across a broad range of geographical and sociocultural settings.",16,6,e0253051,,Data collection; Tier 2 network; Standardization; Systematic review; Data science; Triage; MEDLINE; Data sharing; Common Data Element; Computer science,,Algorithms; Child; Common Data Elements/standards; Delphi Technique; Early Diagnosis; Humans; Mobile Applications; Sepsis/diagnosis; Triage,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NIAID NIH HHS (K23 AI144029) United States,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:2ed1f09a-5fb1-4c61-9f2f-362e55460cc0 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PLoSO..1653051M/abstract https://escholarship.org/content/qt967579qj/qt967579qj.pdf?t=qya4hl https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8192005 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253051 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34111209/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34111209 https://www.tropmedres.ac/publications/1182883 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8192005 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/967579qj,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253051,34111209,10.1371/journal.pone.0253051,3169500233,PMC8192005,0,000-794-003-185-803; 013-548-266-097-731; 017-300-737-144-757; 017-578-122-725-148; 026-252-081-638-000; 032-997-709-660-048; 033-676-533-513-106; 033-966-026-212-427; 056-093-060-707-305; 065-972-387-945-089; 070-619-090-239-283; 079-219-478-218-301; 083-275-795-865-394; 099-610-871-354-868; 105-274-998-934-953; 108-821-125-417-198; 116-661-965-783-908; 122-368-017-221-205; 134-189-660-446-261; 146-740-615-959-946,2

Gaps in their knowledge of day-to-day and emergency management have been identified. There are also gaps in services available to support adolescents at risk of anaphylaxis. Aims: To explore the experiences and healthcare needs of adolescents living with the risk of anaphylaxis; to understand the perspectives of their parents; and to look at how care might be improved. Methods: A qualitative study was undertaken using in-depth interviews with adolescents with a recent history of severe allergic reactions and with their parents. Results: Twenty-six adolescents at risk of anaphylaxis living in Scotland and their parents (n=28) were recruited. Most anaphylactic reactions reported by participants appeared to result from accidents, misinformation, or inexperience. For many, management involved finding a balance between taking their allergies seriously whilst not allowing these concerns to dominate their lives. Risks were often difficult to judge, with reactions sometimes taking place even after careful checking of meal ingredients. Most admitted taking some risks with trace-labelled foods. Appropriate healthcare support for adolescents in learning to manage the risk of anaphylaxis independently and advice and support for their parents was inconsistently provided. Conclusions: Adolescents tend to see their risk management strategies as ‘good enough’, but these strategies were often inconsistent with clinical best practice and, in some cases, had not prevented reactions. Building on adolescents’ existing skills and knowledge and the use of Internet and associated social media resources may help to support more effective self-management among adolescents.",21,4,392,397,Health care; Best practice; Qualitative research; Young adult; Food allergy; Misinformation; Risk management; Family medicine; Medical emergency; Emergency management; Medicine,,"Adolescent; Anaphylaxis/psychology; Female; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Male; Parents/psychology; Psychology, Adolescent; Young Adult",,Chief Scientist Office United Kingdom,https://www.nature.com/articles/pcrj201272.pdf http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22875142 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6548038 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aziz_Sheikh/publication/230638233_Strategies_for_living_with_the_risk_of_anaphylaxis_in_adolescence_Qualitative_study_of_young_people_and_their_parents/links/0912f50656059480cf000000.pdf http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/strategies-for-living-with-the-risk-of-anaphylaxis-in-adolescence(abb86e49-aeb6-410c-a885-1e98c8e69260)/export.html https://core.ac.uk/display/9649046 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/71353/ https://www.nature.com/articles/pcrj201272 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6548038 https://doi.org/10.4104%2Fpcrj.2012.00072 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22875142/ https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/strategies-for-living-with-the-risk-of-anaphylaxis-in-adolescence(abb86e49-aeb6-410c-a885-1e98c8e69260).html,http://dx.doi.org/10.4104/pcrj.2012.00072,22875142,10.4104/pcrj.2012.00072,2072347952,PMC6548038,0,002-259-470-348-50X; 005-160-951-729-767; 005-514-830-555-25X; 008-506-385-659-294; 008-822-569-125-267; 009-987-967-260-028; 010-061-521-687-453; 010-401-238-903-542; 010-759-825-849-620; 022-188-670-637-904; 029-518-459-365-96X; 037-865-918-720-77X; 046-069-320-937-842; 046-876-296-575-095; 049-634-552-138-992; 051-008-533-574-493; 061-740-467-227-089; 067-691-876-486-823; 067-928-436-101-398; 068-226-649-583-861; 069-348-879-085-528; 072-208-618-434-535; 073-924-983-215-975; 074-133-731-646-192; 076-866-109-797-258; 079-268-089-633-879; 085-348-206-274-308; 086-696-251-596-143; 088-143-848-657-829; 089-622-046-209-842; 105-997-095-687-807; 114-749-157-279-862; 128-205-371-614-214; 131-353-666-333-164; 131-603-641-797-447; 140-886-990-928-74X; 144-274-733-005-088; 150-661-930-311-276; 163-851-241-475-872; 189-351-887-620-082,58

Hudson; Athen Ma; Daniel M. Perkins; Guy Woodward,"Abstract Food webs are important tools for understanding how complex natural communities are structured and how they respond to environmental change. However their full potential has yet to be realised because of the huge amount of resources required to construct them de novo. Consequently, the current catalogue of networks that are suitable for rigorous and comparative analyses and theoretical development still suffers from a lack of standardisation and replication. Here, we present a novel R function, WebBuilder , which automates the construction of food webs from taxonomic lists, and a dataset of trophic interactions. This function works by matching species against those within a dataset of trophic interactions, and ‘filling in’ missing trophic interactions based on these matches. We also present a dataset of over 20,000 freshwater trophic interactions, and use this and four well-characterised freshwater food webs to test the method. The WebBuilder function facilitates the generation of food webs of comparable quality to the most detailed published food webs, but at a fraction of the research effort or cost. Furthermore, it matched and often outperformed a selection of predictive models, which are currently among the best, in terms of capturing key properties of empirical food webs. The method is simple to use, systematic and, perhaps most importantly, reproducible, which will facilitate (re-) analysis and data sharing. Although developed and tested on a sample of freshwater food webs, this method could easily be extended to cover other types of ecological interactions (such as mutualistic interactions).",5,,11,20,Data mining; Matching (statistics); Data science; Quality (business); Data sharing; Automated method; Sample (statistics); Replication (computing); Trophic level; Function (engineering); Biology,,,,Queen Mary University of London; Freshwater Biological Association; Natural Environment Research Council; Natural Environment Research Council,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352249615300045 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352249615300045 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2015.09.001 https://core.ac.uk/display/77003545,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2015.09.001,,10.1016/j.fooweb.2015.09.001,1856483474,,0,000-342-659-726-206; 000-673-600-970-278; 002-660-143-434-882; 004-316-923-103-486; 005-597-339-285-858; 006-629-353-249-116; 008-058-429-161-935; 009-859-881-926-822; 011-171-016-486-478; 011-532-085-210-521; 011-705-742-277-818; 012-430-973-203-10X; 013-968-682-686-296; 016-817-199-305-044; 016-953-246-323-226; 017-460-164-330-781; 017-853-128-603-970; 019-320-865-717-661; 022-000-730-912-609; 025-540-648-384-153; 028-353-886-434-748; 029-196-338-915-460; 034-305-359-799-332; 035-081-326-853-407; 036-889-703-611-912; 046-439-303-627-223; 046-797-719-501-819; 051-898-609-731-203; 057-074-784-738-804; 058-223-516-830-375; 070-238-166-221-321; 075-464-297-805-500; 076-017-491-274-856; 080-259-133-437-48X; 081-652-958-262-319; 087-639-682-022-702; 089-288-177-916-079; 096-299-475-725-825; 097-919-321-274-161; 103-147-868-279-001; 116-403-582-446-507; 117-996-892-697-005; 125-795-763-026-837; 126-934-644-785-703; 130-116-958-059-122; 130-874-336-863-91X; 136-125-624-005-418; 136-833-209-468-463; 149-559-134-698-143; 150-325-162-873-23X; 158-407-148-003-692; 175-464-599-628-904; 176-180-713-841-883; 176-598-397-213-364,24

That puts the safety of the data at risk and undermines the very purpose of data gathering.</ns4:p><ns4:p> PlaSMo stands for ‘Plant Systems-biology Modelling’ and the PlaSMo model repository was envisioned by the plant systems biology community in 2005 with the initial funding lasting till 2010. We addressed the sustainability of the PlaSMo repository and assured preservation of these data by implementing an exit strategy. For our exit strategy we migrated data to an alternative public repository of secured funding. We describe details of our decision process and aspects of the implementation. Our experience may serve as an example for other projects in similar situation.</ns4:p><ns4:p> We share our reflections on sustainability of biological data management and the future outcomes of its funding. We expect it to be a useful input for funding bodies.   </ns4:p>",4,,104,,,,,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council; Wellcome Trust,https://core.ac.uk/download/224804252.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15341.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15341.1,,,0,004-200-141-060-704; 012-255-210-363-88X; 022-347-953-225-112; 042-515-330-031-763; 043-637-187-040-684; 051-958-190-667-178; 070-462-022-251-464; 073-915-732-873-477; 085-882-395-201-561; 102-053-309-857-692; 142-560-058-670-889,0

It is largely presumed that understandings of people's everyday interactions will be relatively easy to 'read off' of such data and that this, in turn, poses a privacy threat. An ethnographic study of how people account for sensed data to third parties uncovers serious challenges to such ideas. The study reveals that the legibility of sensor data turns upon various orders of situated reasoning involved in articulating the data and making it accountable. Articulation work is indispensable to personal data sharing and raises real requirements for networked sensing systems premised on the harvesting of personal data.",,,491,502,Internet privacy; Situated; Ubiquitous computing; Work (electrical); Accountability; Legibility; Articulation (sociology); Data sharing; Computer science; Big data,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/30346/ https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/775056 https://core.ac.uk/display/33574776 https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2818048.2819992 https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/775072/CSCW%20%28Personal%20Data%29.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cscw/cscw2016.html#TolmieCRCL16 https://core.ac.uk/download/33574776.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2818048.2819992,,10.1145/2818048.2819992,2176788652,,0,011-808-441-512-943; 016-205-218-637-128; 031-482-486-719-604; 036-074-579-629-156; 039-634-589-458-209; 040-186-781-237-392; 041-909-963-107-444; 046-560-055-967-644; 054-446-122-421-58X; 057-707-862-764-58X; 094-803-474-712-552; 100-758-919-905-02X; 114-700-978-155-966; 115-820-127-143-257; 155-042-472-461-793; 163-556-661-292-94X; 165-589-821-141-387,66

Pearce,"COVID-19 has disproportionately affected minority ethnic groups in the United Kingdom. To maximise the effectiveness of the vaccination programme, it is important to understand and address disparities in vaccine uptake. The aim of this review was to identify factors influencing COVID-19 vaccination uptake between minority ethnic groups in the UK. A search was undertaken in peer-reviewed databases, polling websites and grey literature from January 2020–May 2021. Studies were included if they reported data on vaccine uptake or the reasons for or against accepting the COVID-19 vaccination for minority ethnic groups in the UK. Twenty-one papers met the inclusion criteria, all of which were rated as either good or moderate quality. Ethnic minority status was associated with higher vaccine hesitancy and lower vaccine uptake compared with White British groups. Barriers included pre-existing mistrust of formal services, lack of information about the vaccine’s safety, misinformation, inaccessible communications, and logistical issues. Facilitators included inclusive communications which address vaccine concerns via trusted communicators and increased visibility of minority ethnic groups in the media. Community engagement to address the concerns and informational needs of minority ethnic groups using trusted and collaborative community and healthcare networks is likely to increase vaccine equity and uptake.",9,10,1121,,Ethnic group; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Health care; Vaccination; Community engagement; Facilitator; Misinformation; Family medicine; Grey literature,COVID-19; barrier; facilitator; minority ethnicity; vaccine uptake,,,UK Research and Innovation (ES/W001721/1),https://www.open-access.bcu.ac.uk/12241/ https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/10/1121/pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/10/1121 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8541490/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34696228/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9101121,34696228,10.3390/vaccines9101121,3202351242,PMC8541490,0,000-726-028-029-087; 017-300-737-144-757; 018-215-452-916-290; 021-477-889-579-707; 041-226-487-679-907; 046-247-152-234-951; 048-618-542-367-904; 053-476-812-647-640; 054-243-684-987-649; 064-179-538-601-807; 066-594-096-598-321; 072-982-254-716-12X; 074-357-099-848-155; 079-669-742-731-525; 083-492-099-361-257; 083-773-397-930-914; 090-154-966-033-430; 141-996-162-508-997; 144-112-003-951-230; 146-427-880-243-657; 188-158-787-573-900,1

McVeigh; Eva Malacova; Nikos Ntoumanis,"Introduction Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent among Australian men. Professional sports settings can act as a powerful ‘hook’ to engage men in weight loss programmes; the Football Fans in Training programme delivered in professional UK soccer clubs was successful and cost-effective in helping men lose weight. The Australian Football League (AFL) is a potentially attractive setting to engage men in a weight loss programme. We aim to develop, pilot and evaluate the feasibility of a weight loss intervention for overweight/obese middle-aged men, delivered in AFL settings, to promote weight loss and healthier lifestyles and determine its suitability for a future randomised control trial. Methods and analysis 120 overweight/obese male fans will complete baseline physical and psychological health measures and objective measures of physical activity (PA), weight, waist size and blood pressure prior to randomisation into the intervention or waitlist comparison group. The intervention group will receive 12 weekly 90 min workshops incorporating PA, nutrition education, behaviour change techniques and principles of effective motivation. Four community coaches will be trained to deliver Aussie-FIT at two AFL clubs in Western Australia. Measurements will be repeated in both groups at 3 months (post-intervention) and 6 months (follow-up). Outcomes will include programme uptake, attendance, changes in lifestyle and weight variables to inform power calculations for a future definitive trial, fidelity of programme delivery, acceptability, satisfaction with the programme and perceptions of effectiveness. We will also determine trial feasibility and potential to gather cost-effectiveness data. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was granted by Curtin University’s Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC2017-0458). Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and reports. A multicomponent dissemination strategy will include targeted translation and stakeholder engagement events to establish strategies for sustainability and policy change.

In recent years, public health emergencies such as avian influenza, drug-resistant malaria, and Ebola have brought renewed attention to the need for effective communication channels between health authorities, particularly in regional contexts where neighbouring countries share common health threats. However, little empirical research has been conducted to date to explore the range of factors that may affect the transfer, exchange, and use of public health data and expertise across borders, especially in developing contexts. To explore these issues, 60 interviews were conducted with domestic and international stakeholders in Cambodia and Vietnam, selected amongst those who were involved in regional public health programmes and networks. Data analysis was structured around three categories mapped across the dataset: (1) the nature of shared data and information; (2) the nature of communication channels; and (3) how information flow may be affected by the local, regional, and global system of rules and arrangements. There has been a great intensification in the circulation of data, information, and expertise across borders in Southeast Asia. However, findings from this study document ways in which the movement of data and information from production sites to other places can be challenging due to different standards and practices, language barriers, different national structures and rules that govern the circulation of health information inside and outside countries, imbalances in capacities and power, and sustainability of financing arrangements. Our study highlights the complex socio-technical nature of data and information sharing, suggesting that best practices require significant involvement of an independent third-party brokering organisation or office, which can redress imbalances between country partners at different levels in the data sharing process, create meaningful communication channels and make the most of shared information and data sets.",14,1,94,94,Information flow (information theory); Public health; Business; Health informatics; International Health Regulations; Redress; Information sharing; Data sharing; Health services research; Public relations,Health data and information sharing; Health information systems; Infectious disease surveillance; International health regulations; Regional health cooperation; Southeast Asia,"Asia, Southeastern; Communicable Disease Control; Humans; Information Dissemination; International Cooperation; Public Health; Qualitative Research",,Economic and Social Research Council,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12992-018-0415-0.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30268139 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12992-018-0415-0 https://doaj.org/article/031f937a745e4717bf9bfc0dc46edba8 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30268139 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30268139/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6162912 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4649507/ https://globalizationandhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12992-018-0415-0 https://core.ac.uk/download/161536144.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12992-018-0415-0,30268139,10.1186/s12992-018-0415-0,2893027729,PMC6162912,0,004-045-479-684-322; 004-921-716-427-977; 005-112-156-303-63X; 005-310-523-435-552; 007-411-628-392-46X; 008-345-895-678-669; 014-675-051-304-586; 014-907-251-578-880; 017-276-044-541-322; 017-336-348-173-786; 018-463-866-263-958; 020-362-567-715-343; 020-886-390-612-839; 021-202-953-431-780; 021-889-607-718-889; 023-347-233-641-851; 026-006-012-657-693; 030-578-386-434-521; 031-317-472-674-186; 032-108-958-983-814; 032-749-427-802-041; 033-924-090-061-146; 034-161-067-337-179; 034-403-401-153-017; 038-754-668-865-881; 038-824-642-263-293; 043-689-796-284-013; 043-813-119-071-745; 049-182-621-937-380; 050-964-750-581-108; 055-498-815-134-39X; 062-438-763-676-46X; 067-224-704-311-901; 068-420-354-433-785; 070-564-217-326-902; 077-567-241-057-683; 078-286-797-787-820; 079-299-413-069-918; 079-698-298-416-352; 081-190-733-539-15X; 085-296-805-225-995; 086-470-411-539-657; 090-824-731-152-486; 092-580-078-359-509; 099-222-258-328-915; 100-441-363-187-695; 102-797-970-956-257; 103-590-757-361-965; 103-849-254-219-22X; 118-085-022-435-430; 124-707-160-725-322; 128-346-662-507-813; 128-585-575-533-480; 144-551-584-551-212; 172-050-711-716-180; 172-944-759-080-778,3

Emery; Felix Naughton; Sue Cooper; Jane Dyas; Tim Coleman,"Smoking during pregnancy is a leading cause of negative pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. While UK guidelines recommend nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation during pregnancy, adherence to NRT is generally low and may partially explain why NRT appears less effective in pregnancy compared to non-pregnant smokers. This study aimed to identify and describe factors associated with NRT adherence from a health professional's perspective. Two focus groups and one expert group were conducted with 26 professionals involved in antenatal stop smoking services and the data were analysed thematically using a template methodology. From our analyses, we extracted two main themes: (i) 'Barriers to NRT use in pregnancy' explores the issues of how misinformation and unrealistic expectations could discourage NRT use, while (ii) 'Facilitators to NRT use in pregnancy' describes the different information, and modes of delivery, that stop smoking professionals believe will encourage correct and sustained NRT use. Understanding the barriers and facilitators to improve NRT adherence may aid the development of educational interventions to encourage NRT use and improve outcomes for pregnant women wanting to stop smoking.",16,10,1814,,Health care; Qualitative research; Misinformation; Smoking cessation; Pregnancy; Nicotine replacement therapy; Prenatal smoking; Family medicine; Focus group; Medicine,NRT; nicotine replacement therapy; pregnancy; smoking cessation; stop smoking services,"Adult; Aged; Educational Status; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Qualitative Research; Smoking Cessation/methods; Smoking Prevention; Socioeconomic Factors; Tobacco Smoking/prevention & control; Tobacco Use Cessation Devices/statistics & numerical data",,Department of Health (RP-PG-0615-20003) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6571581 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/71234/ https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/10/1814/htm https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31121850 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31121850/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31121850 https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/10/1814/pdf https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/publications/knowledge-and-education-as-barriers-and-facilitators-to-nicotine- https://doaj.org/article/e8d138b179864cb89302350de2412dc4 https://core.ac.uk/download/210500794.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16101814,31121850,10.3390/ijerph16101814,2945852366,PMC6571581,0,001-595-826-777-230; 008-388-721-040-163; 009-627-096-122-615; 009-744-560-355-723; 012-237-407-271-47X; 012-831-404-295-507; 013-133-623-890-128; 013-631-692-819-191; 015-518-576-117-000; 020-616-564-058-664; 020-688-958-964-603; 023-566-235-370-362; 023-787-937-177-531; 024-267-347-953-016; 027-818-991-321-156; 028-165-196-298-269; 029-329-349-966-42X; 035-396-956-552-330; 035-694-921-871-37X; 036-029-061-137-250; 036-226-013-959-498; 036-534-205-337-217; 037-052-588-840-825; 042-864-551-493-086; 045-803-651-509-348; 048-995-169-989-02X; 055-957-078-839-831; 056-255-929-066-081; 060-829-731-682-473; 064-624-470-369-791; 069-945-649-503-11X; 072-557-228-424-601; 073-763-885-603-97X; 074-449-256-531-29X; 075-503-666-688-178; 075-510-705-966-19X; 080-986-410-560-875; 082-461-831-366-553; 094-951-663-346-656; 097-449-085-536-84X; 098-443-481-744-615; 100-612-724-934-662; 110-635-515-277-648; 126-196-362-902-48X; 129-350-334-563-507; 130-794-244-516-670; 133-615-216-407-672; 135-085-766-434-197; 171-505-386-709-359,7

There is emerging evidence that vaccine hesitancy is higher in ethnic minorities and deprived areas, and that this may be caused by distrust and misinformation in the community.  This study aims to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in an ethnically diverse and deprived population of Bradford through the Born in Bradford (BiB) research programme.</ns4:p><ns4:p> <ns4:bold>Methods</ns4:bold>: Surveys were sent to parents in BiB who had taken part in a previous Covid-19 survey (n=1727). Cross tabulations explored variation by ethnicity and deprivation.

Wong,"Success rates for genomic analyses of highly heterogeneous disorders can be greatly improved if a large cohort of patient data is assembled to enhance collective capabilities for accurate sequence variant annotation, analysis, and interpretation. Indeed, molecular diagnostics requires the establishment of robust data resources to enable data sharing that informs accurate understanding of genes, variants, and phenotypes. The ""Mitochondrial Disease Sequence Data Resource (MSeqDR) Consortium"" is a grass-roots effort facilitated by the United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation to identify and prioritize specific genomic data analysis needs of the global mitochondrial disease clinical and research community. A central Web portal (https://mseqdr.org) facilitates the coherent compilation, organization, annotation, and analysis of sequence data from both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of individuals and families with suspected mitochondrial disease. This Web portal provides users with a flexible and expandable suite of resources to enable variant-, gene-, and exome-level sequence analysis in a secure, Web-based, and user-friendly fashion. Users can also elect to share data with other MSeqDR Consortium members, or even the general public, either by custom annotation tracks or through the use of a convenient distributed annotation system (DAS) mechanism. A range of data visualization and analysis tools are provided to facilitate user interrogation and understanding of genomic, and ultimately phenotypic, data of relevance to mitochondrial biology and disease. Currently available tools for nuclear and mitochondrial gene analyses include an MSeqDR GBrowse instance that hosts optimized mitochondrial disease and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) specific annotation tracks, as well as an MSeqDR locus-specific database (LSDB) that curates variant data on more than 1300 genes that have been implicated in mitochondrial disease and/or encode mitochondria-localized proteins. MSeqDR is integrated with a diverse array of mtDNA data analysis tools that are both freestanding and incorporated into an online exome-level dataset curation and analysis resource (GEM.app) that is being optimized to support needs of the MSeqDR community. In addition, MSeqDR supports mitochondrial disease phenotyping and ontology tools, and provides variant pathogenicity assessment features that enable community review, feedback, and integration with the public ClinVar variant annotation resource. A centralized Web-based informed consent process is being developed, with implementation of a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) system to integrate data deposited on a given individual from different sources. Community-based data deposition into MSeqDR has already begun. Future efforts will enhance capabilities to incorporate phenotypic data that enhance genomic data analyses. MSeqDR will fill the existing void in bioinformatics tools and centralized knowledge that are necessary to enable efficient nuclear and mtDNA genomic data interpretation by a range of shareholders across both clinical diagnostic and research settings.

Machado; Christopher Burr; Josh Cowls; Indra Joshi; Mariarosaria Taddeo; Luciano Floridi,"This article presents a mapping review of the literature concerning the ethics of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care. The goal of this review is to summarise current debates and identify open questions for future research. Five literature databases were searched to support the following research question: how can the primary ethical risks presented by AI-health be categorised, and what issues must policymakers, regulators and developers consider in order to be 'ethically mindful? A series of screening stages were carried out-for example, removing articles that focused on digital health in general (e.g. data sharing, data access, data privacy, surveillance/nudging, consent, ownership of health data, evidence of efficacy)-yielding a total of 156 papers that were included in the review. We find that ethical issues can be (a) epistemic, related to misguided, inconclusive or inscrutable evidence; (b) normative, related to unfair outcomes and transformative effectives; or (c) related to traceability. We further find that these ethical issues arise at six levels of abstraction: individual, interpersonal, group, institutional, and societal or sectoral. Finally, we outline a number of considerations for policymakers and regulators, mapping these to existing literature, and categorising each as epistemic, normative or traceability-related and at the relevant level of abstraction. Our goal is to inform policymakers, regulators and developers of what they must consider if they are to enable health and care systems to capitalise on the dual advantage of ethical AI; maximising the opportunities to cut costs, improve care, and improve the efficiency of health and care systems, whilst proactively avoiding the potential harms. We argue that if action is not swiftly taken in this regard, a new 'AI winter' could occur due to chilling effects related to a loss of public trust in the benefits of AI for health care.",260,,113172,,Information privacy; Psychology; Health care; Public trust; Research question; Data sharing; Digital health; Public relations; Normative; Transformative learning,Artificial intelligence; Ethics; Health policies; Healthcare; Machine learning,Artificial Intelligence; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Morals; Ownership; Privacy,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Microsoft; Google,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620303919 https://philpapers.org/archive/MORTEO-92.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-81907-1_18 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702587 https://philpapers.org/rec/MORTEO-92 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v260y2020ics0277953620303919.html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32702587/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113172,32702587,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113172,3042276730,,0,001-302-113-568-875; 001-556-086-714-979; 001-733-476-505-851; 001-973-492-398-825; 002-270-820-512-507; 002-329-262-649-878; 002-640-636-447-130; 003-092-235-403-69X; 003-376-741-403-048; 003-921-849-886-855; 004-970-535-028-716; 005-868-714-165-674; 006-902-603-626-928; 008-602-081-756-407; 008-662-290-220-54X; 009-391-345-088-756; 011-884-864-277-150; 012-002-478-614-082; 012-611-990-257-022; 013-335-100-879-865; 013-867-547-915-567; 014-031-984-182-564; 014-125-553-660-146; 016-278-695-721-231; 016-333-206-541-782; 017-105-410-445-95X; 018-373-087-890-136; 018-819-192-811-501; 018-897-718-914-710; 019-041-386-067-401; 020-312-904-313-80X; 020-476-875-927-765; 020-615-399-350-228; 020-797-195-204-122; 021-773-547-906-428; 022-392-687-390-192; 023-227-607-345-744; 023-779-146-782-110; 024-029-042-022-778; 025-370-045-015-261; 026-577-296-007-893; 027-482-500-066-079; 028-105-022-143-617; 028-951-880-596-981; 029-746-419-666-906; 030-173-966-731-586; 031-144-911-441-69X; 034-102-176-182-014; 034-270-410-745-835; 035-143-251-827-95X; 035-681-077-369-081; 037-658-231-717-847; 037-673-206-268-344; 037-918-641-493-047; 038-566-044-736-24X; 040-345-187-336-318; 041-114-554-675-88X; 041-275-220-858-296; 041-816-561-565-570; 041-916-822-466-801; 042-145-302-543-360; 042-546-757-247-119; 042-677-537-623-119; 042-816-707-154-771; 043-987-259-518-633; 044-350-079-774-312; 044-371-975-644-56X; 046-066-714-149-677; 046-878-848-814-47X; 047-752-890-498-813; 048-109-564-056-343; 048-198-121-847-688; 049-434-143-804-644; 050-979-258-697-59X; 051-727-209-501-525; 052-135-719-572-574; 054-466-098-022-607; 054-655-440-249-579; 055-456-337-855-743; 055-502-988-908-057; 056-447-038-465-448; 057-685-577-902-651; 059-855-122-123-784; 060-698-182-910-172; 060-871-414-825-628; 062-899-243-823-94X; 065-025-537-929-119; 065-150-064-642-697; 065-658-947-661-08X; 066-451-904-660-341; 067-746-029-370-315; 068-803-696-299-959; 069-556-172-365-311; 071-413-130-992-767; 071-525-044-580-818; 071-576-451-307-448; 073-267-268-269-90X; 074-835-217-027-221; 074-875-121-725-371; 074-998-884-944-791; 075-563-566-640-382; 077-240-906-727-932; 077-910-375-699-521; 078-413-643-098-853; 079-432-423-733-587; 080-978-248-481-035; 081-547-256-855-879; 082-502-175-768-359; 082-593-409-100-308; 083-737-685-034-550; 083-921-097-907-896; 084-296-717-156-065; 090-051-220-864-332; 091-900-403-265-308; 092-500-900-099-391; 094-378-912-261-911; 098-110-393-186-005; 100-368-627-411-331; 100-555-167-097-364; 101-877-795-157-186; 104-699-043-164-156; 104-773-185-609-694; 107-641-666-276-426; 107-918-636-400-229; 109-540-177-736-719; 110-565-016-728-837; 114-673-808-442-160; 116-652-369-563-808; 121-811-652-958-334; 124-581-098-081-085; 129-824-843-006-540; 131-377-862-731-799; 133-561-304-695-458; 137-394-032-522-050; 147-461-291-083-259; 157-117-347-940-388; 159-039-442-426-733; 159-316-590-947-162; 160-352-547-184-634; 162-412-134-341-528; 165-213-269-306-233; 170-801-215-435-437; 171-857-913-054-737; 173-885-518-322-050; 180-568-873-082-56X; 185-114-899-783-01X,53
1329,018-373-694-205-946,"He did it! She did it! No, she did not! Multiple causal explanations and the continued influence of misinformation",,2015,journal article,Journal of Memory and Language,0749596x; 10960821,Elsevier BV,United States,Ullrich K. H. Ecker; Stephan Lewandowsky; Candy S.C. Cheung; Murray T. Maybery,"Two types of misinformation effects are discussed in the literature—the post-event misinformation effect and the continued influence effect. The former refers to the distorting memorial effects of misleading information that is presented after valid event encoding; the latter refers to information that is initially presented as true but subsequently turns out to be false and continues to affect memory and reasoning despite the correction. In two experiments, using a paradigm that merges elements from both traditions, we investigated the role of presentation order and recency when two competing causal explanations for an event are presented and one is subsequently retracted. Theoretical accounts of misinformation effects make diverging predictions regarding the roles of presentation order and recency. A recency account—derived from time-based models of memory and reading comprehension research suggesting efficient situation model updating—predicts that the more recently presented cause should have a stronger influence on memory and reasoning. By contrast, a primacy account—derived from primacy effects in impression formation and story recall as well as findings of inadequate memory updating—predicts that the initially presented cause should be dominant irrespective of temporal factors. Results indicated that (1) a cause’s recency, rather than its position (i.e., whether it was presented first or last) determined the emphasis that people place on it in their later reasoning, with more recent explanations being preferred; and (2) a retraction was equally effective whether it invalidated the first or the second cause, as long as the cause’s recency was held constant. This provides evidence against the primacy account and supports time-based models of memory such as temporal distinctiveness theory.",85,,101,115,Recall; Psychology; Impression formation; Cognitive psychology; Event (relativity); Misinformation; Reading comprehension; Misinformation effect; Affect (psychology); Optimal distinctiveness theory; Social psychology,,,,Royal Society,https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/he-did-it-she-did-it-no-she-did-not-multiple-causal-explanations-and-the-continued-influence-of-misinformation(d6ee7091-bb8c-4cc7-81f8-c9825303f8e3).html https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/he-did-it-she-did-it-no-she-did-not-multiple-causal-explanations-and-the-continued-influence-of-misinformation(51742093-a8f3-4c10-81ed-53ec7ff2e0c3).html https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/he-did-it-she-did-it-no-she-did-not-multiple-causal-explanations- http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X15001035 https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/files/11787265/Ecker_et_al_He_did_it_She_did_it_2015_.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X15001035,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2015.09.002,,10.1016/j.jml.2015.09.002,1955589627,,0,000-258-508-654-151; 000-537-728-327-568; 003-704-353-801-095; 003-734-647-838-341; 006-375-722-025-736; 006-503-138-311-606; 007-715-107-004-516; 008-119-989-268-331; 009-549-222-842-576; 010-150-302-588-978; 010-495-778-776-724; 011-060-968-966-450; 013-928-384-943-753; 014-171-475-020-617; 016-455-286-032-843; 018-775-161-084-995; 021-309-658-924-62X; 021-947-135-928-409; 024-305-889-859-643; 026-402-291-240-122; 026-851-761-221-49X; 026-884-439-142-583; 027-541-466-701-354; 027-898-004-958-085; 027-957-537-714-574; 028-943-224-220-011; 030-155-705-931-054; 032-512-028-035-855; 034-399-990-171-379; 034-934-410-488-25X; 035-775-158-559-159; 036-173-424-576-436; 037-379-498-186-385; 037-738-815-899-381; 037-792-052-035-32X; 038-199-658-596-841; 038-542-564-501-704; 038-757-074-605-939; 039-828-399-385-390; 040-479-750-681-289; 041-237-580-296-170; 041-680-463-566-043; 041-973-555-191-84X; 042-697-979-104-285; 045-266-825-185-291; 046-622-317-412-19X; 048-025-992-903-619; 050-658-840-600-100; 050-712-905-996-885; 052-393-710-318-774; 053-192-466-099-332; 053-459-201-895-587; 053-618-825-807-923; 053-685-339-783-022; 054-966-066-209-46X; 059-169-947-644-285; 059-615-292-153-510; 060-467-272-358-598; 061-155-137-941-717; 064-005-562-218-728; 065-685-112-435-897; 067-657-587-537-63X; 068-458-072-982-51X; 070-639-659-331-673; 076-939-793-290-780; 079-253-173-555-517; 079-639-995-023-837; 082-384-118-688-104; 086-245-004-803-720; 093-665-351-321-19X; 102-639-466-518-342; 102-932-635-819-318; 105-217-131-911-790; 106-238-042-135-653; 108-119-932-023-929; 108-792-850-682-285; 109-948-808-902-875; 110-467-212-639-226; 111-648-445-350-617; 113-466-164-836-35X; 114-728-792-322-759; 115-087-071-547-412; 115-461-858-471-463; 118-568-752-890-642; 119-239-299-619-780; 120-735-129-332-136; 121-188-441-091-951; 124-156-478-794-354; 130-634-530-356-898; 154-184-500-791-835; 163-719-678-022-835; 165-259-751-396-496; 170-511-578-648-743; 171-505-386-709-359; 185-583-304-881-019; 191-024-354-280-111,53

At the same time, UK local authorities face severe financial challenges as a result of decreasing financial settlements and increasing demands from growing urban populations. This research employs state-of-the-art data analytics and visualisation techniques to analyse six years of local government social care data for the city of Birmingham, the UK's second most populated city. This analysis identifies: (i) service cost profiles over time; (ii) geographical dimensions to service demand and delivery; (iii) patterns in the provision of services, and (iv) the extent to which data value and data protection interact. The research accesses data held by the local authority to discover patterns and insights that may assist in the understanding of service demand, support decision making and resource management, whilst protecting and safeguarding its most vulnerable citizens. The use of data in this manner could also inform the approach a local authority has to its data, its capture and use, and the potential for supporting data-led management and service improvements.",,,5,,Business; Marketing; Human settlement; Safeguarding; Local government; National interest; Service (economics); Data Protection Act 1998; Big data; Resource management,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/dgo/dgo2018.html#ChotvijitTJ18 https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/102871 https://doi.org/10.1145/3209281.3209300 https://core.ac.uk/download/158139179.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3209281.3209300,,10.1145/3209281.3209300,2807165943,,0,003-777-179-159-996; 005-951-365-540-153; 006-008-088-467-339; 015-798-261-593-618; 018-164-035-016-825; 019-901-841-002-835; 024-149-520-594-022; 030-333-887-262-144; 044-020-653-120-638; 048-608-677-283-290; 057-410-472-211-800; 075-963-893-421-77X; 078-810-960-701-387; 079-523-339-344-312; 080-962-586-575-468; 085-122-853-332-330; 091-304-180-375-305; 094-121-546-211-856; 114-993-862-436-151; 193-708-602-817-88X,0

In this paper, we discuss the challenge of reconciling data-sharing principles with the practicalities of delivering a sequencing project of UK10K’s scope and magnitude. We describe the development of a sustainable, easy-to-use managed access system that allowed rapid access to UK10K data, while protecting the interests of participants and data generators alike.

False beliefs, once adopted, are rarely corrected. Amidst the COVID-19 crisis, pandemic-deniers and people who oppose wearing face masks or quarantine have already been a substantial aspect of the development of the pandemic. With the vaccine for COVID-19, different anti-vaccine narratives are being created and are probably being adopted by large population groups with critical consequences. Assuming full adherence to vaccine administration, we use a diffusion model to analyse epidemic spreading and the impact of different vaccination strategies, measured with the average years of life lost, in three network topologies (a proximity, a scale-free and a small-world network). Then, using a similar diffusion model, we consider the spread of anti-vaccine views in the network, which are adopted based on a persuasiveness parameter of anti-vaccine views. Results show that even if anti-vaccine narratives have a small persuasiveness, a large part of the population will be rapidly exposed to them. Assuming that all individuals are equally likely to adopt anti-vaccine views after being exposed, more central nodes in the network, which are more exposed to these views, are more likely to adopt them. Comparing years of life lost, anti-vaccine views could have a significant cost not only on those who share them, since the core social benefits of a limited vaccination strategy (reduction of susceptible hosts, network disruptions and slowing the spread of the disease) are substantially shortened.",11,1,6626,6626,Years of potential life lost; Psychology; Network topology; Vaccination; Misinformation; Population; Anti-Vaccination Movement; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Demographic economics; Pandemic,,"Anti-Vaccination Movement/psychology; Attitude; COVID-19/immunology; COVID-19 Vaccines/immunology; Humans; Models, Theoretical; SARS-CoV-2/isolation & purification; Social Networking; Vaccination",COVID-19 Vaccines,UKRI's Global Challenge Research Fund (ES/P011055/1),https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85555-1.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988012 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85555-1 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2009.html#abs-2009-13674 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10125441/ https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR271352 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021NatSR..11.6626P/abstract https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33758218/ https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-1147845 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2009.html#abs-2009-13674,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85555-1,33758218,10.1038/s41598-021-85555-1,3136361928,PMC7988012,0,000-203-627-584-442; 000-892-588-655-186; 002-895-760-133-651; 003-178-408-223-054; 004-397-997-709-891; 004-589-811-907-176; 005-357-486-256-78X; 009-076-377-433-18X; 009-500-882-835-147; 011-862-918-104-881; 012-453-633-681-983; 012-596-894-106-344; 013-810-650-964-44X; 017-318-261-415-333; 017-986-230-920-04X; 019-371-292-213-57X; 021-940-008-382-093; 023-088-677-737-850; 030-240-639-525-686; 030-926-572-220-349; 032-012-667-265-541; 032-361-120-263-169; 032-840-755-685-806; 040-468-943-191-418; 040-914-250-437-144; 041-927-598-353-370; 044-345-261-905-116; 047-018-469-785-302; 047-612-237-926-630; 052-383-503-419-047; 053-088-579-776-766; 058-281-220-919-982; 060-130-648-144-202; 063-105-968-478-441; 063-190-811-897-241; 064-875-847-099-741; 065-174-101-115-391; 065-754-955-179-285; 067-327-630-545-132; 075-731-761-310-100; 078-035-456-983-43X; 078-618-852-669-949; 084-413-556-548-42X; 085-448-838-401-764; 092-756-680-228-874; 095-402-564-913-277; 099-381-960-676-90X; 100-452-585-142-111; 103-022-422-356-528; 105-282-956-706-039; 106-021-557-366-277; 109-812-455-158-514; 112-605-452-054-564; 113-951-620-152-007; 117-799-493-588-810; 119-760-144-322-576; 124-994-169-976-149; 141-439-658-673-37X; 143-200-215-006-787; 150-325-162-873-23X; 162-784-395-057-194; 166-219-096-955-035; 171-310-402-084-37X; 189-132-135-147-165; 193-730-751-362-402,20

This paper describes VivaxGEN (http://vivaxgen.menzies.edu.au), a web-based platform that has been developed to support P. vivax short tandem repeat data sharing and comparative analyses. The VivaxGEN platform provides a repository for raw data generated by capillary electrophoresis (FSA files), with fragment analysis and standardized allele calling tools. The query system of the platform enables users to filter, select and differentiate samples and alleles based on their specified criteria. Key population genetic analyses are supported including measures of population differentiation (FST), expected heterozygosity (HE), linkage disequilibrium (IAS), neighbor-joining analysis and Principal Coordinate Analysis. Datasets can also be formatted and exported for application in commonly used population genetic software including GENEPOP, Arlequin and STRUCTURE. To date, data from 10 countries, including 5 publicly available data sets have been shared with VivaxGEN. VivaxGEN is well placed to facilitate regional overviews of P. vivax transmission dynamics in different endemic settings and capable to be adapted for similar genetic studies of P. falciparum and other organisms.",11,3,1,12,Data sharing; Plasmodium vivax; Population; Genotyping; Linkage disequilibrium; Genetics; Microsatellite; Genetic variation; Computational biology; Population genetics; Biology,,"Access to Information; Alleles; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Humans; Information Dissemination; Information Storage and Retrieval; Internet; Linkage Disequilibrium; Malaria, Falciparum/epidemiology; Microsatellite Repeats; Plasmodium falciparum/genetics; Plasmodium vivax/genetics; Software; Statistics as Topic/methods",,Medical Research Council (MR/K000551/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M01360X/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (091625) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (100217/Z/12/A) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (200909) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/N010469/1) United Kingdom,https://core.ac.uk/display/81674718 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5389845 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005465 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/3716577 https://www.tropmedres.ac/publications/688774 https://researchers.cdu.edu.au/en/publications/vivaxgen-an-open-access-platform-for-comparative-analysis-of-shor http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28362818 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28362818 https://core.ac.uk/download/81674718.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0005465,28362818,10.1371/journal.pntd.0005465,2598789838,PMC5389845,0,000-629-238-284-348; 003-222-082-279-503; 003-246-407-814-25X; 003-852-385-990-788; 013-555-612-676-265; 013-920-640-353-984; 018-716-056-554-051; 020-350-867-968-475; 020-447-768-335-93X; 024-017-496-480-257; 024-152-313-438-286; 024-885-176-862-045; 025-479-146-258-210; 032-674-923-021-160; 033-426-755-456-942; 043-597-821-250-715; 044-920-127-998-33X; 045-204-288-692-170; 045-550-567-482-944; 046-327-985-704-495; 048-189-641-954-618; 049-976-412-354-562; 051-918-163-935-740; 057-584-387-956-066; 065-913-003-281-798; 066-516-537-626-209; 068-242-664-511-225; 070-623-741-498-791; 078-018-433-087-355; 092-038-644-179-423; 107-416-026-101-221; 116-551-414-789-206; 121-410-964-346-217; 134-539-311-283-553; 156-079-473-403-072; 166-584-513-707-098; 169-165-690-340-787,14

Wright; Philippa Williams; Olga Elizarova; Jennifer Dahne; Jian-Guo Bian; Yunpeng Zhao; Andy S.L. Tan,"OBJECTIVES To assess the effect of exposure to misinformation about e-cigarette harms found on Twitter on adult current smokers' intention to quit smoking cigarettes, intention to purchase e-cigarettes and perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes compared with regular cigarettes. SETTING An online randomised controlled experiment conducted in November 2019 among USA and UK current smokers. PARTICIPANTS 2400 adult current smokers aged ≥18 years who were not current e-cigarette users recruited from an online panel. Participants' were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio using a least-fill randomiser function. INTERVENTIONS Viewing 4 tweets in random order within one of four conditions: (1) e-cigarettes are just as or more harmful than smoking, (2) e-cigarettes are completely harmless, (3) e-cigarette harms are uncertain, and (4) a control condition of tweets about physical activity. PRIMARY OUTCOMES MEASURES Self-reported post-test intention to quit smoking cigarettes, intention to purchase e-cigarettes, and perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes compared with smoking. RESULTS Among US and UK participants, after controlling for baseline measures of the outcome, exposure to tweets that e-cigarettes are as or more harmful than smoking versus control was associated with lower post-test intention to purchase e-cigarettes (β=-0.339, 95% CI -0.487 to -0.191, p<0.001) and increased post-test perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes (β=0.341, 95% CI 0.273 to 0.410, p<0.001). Among US smokers, exposure to tweets that e-cigarettes are completely harmless was associated with higher post-test intention to purchase e-cigarettes (β=0.229, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.456, p=0.048) and lower post-test perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes (β=-0.154, 95% CI -0.258 to -0.050, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS US and UK adult current smokers may be deterred from considering using e-cigarettes after brief exposure to tweets that e-cigarettes were just as or more harmful than smoking. Conversely, US adult current smokers may be encouraged to use e-cigarettes after exposure to tweets that e-cigarettes are completely harmless. These findings suggest that misinformation about e-cigarette harms may influence some adult smokers' decisions to consider using e-cigarettes.

However, the governance environment, as well as public understanding about this work, have lagged behind. We aimed to systematically review the literature on UK and Irish public views of patient data used in research, critically analysing such views though an established biomedical ethics framework, to draw out potential strategies for future good practice guidance and inform ethical and privacy debates. ; ; Methods: We searched three databases using terms such as patient, public, opinion, and electronic health records. Empirical studies were eligible for inclusion if they surveyed healthcare users, patients or the public in UK and Ireland and examined attitudes, opinions or beliefs about the use of patient data for medical research. Results were synthesised into broad themes using a framework analysis. Results: Out of 13,492 papers and reports screened, 20 papers or reports were eligible. While there was a widespread willingness to share patient data for research for the common good, this very rarely led to unqualified support. The public expressed two generalised concerns about the potential risks to their privacy. The first of these concerns related to a party’s competence in keeping data secure, while the second was associated with the motivation a party might have to use the data. ; ; Conclusions: The public evaluates trustworthiness of research organisations by assessing their competence in data-handling and motivation for accessing the data. Public attitudes around data-sharing exemplified several principles which are also widely accepted in biomedical ethics. This provides a framework for understanding public attitudes, which should be considered in the development in any guidance for regulators and data custodians. We propose four salient questions which decision makers should address when evaluating proposals for the secondary use of data",3,,6,,Competence (human resources); Empirical research; Sociology; Health care; Bioethics; Audit; Custodians; Irish; Corporate governance; Public relations,Electronic Health Records; engagement; ethics; governance; patient data; privacy; public,,,Wellcome Trust,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/3-6 http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/81554/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854470 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/3-6/v2/pdf https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/3-6/v1/xml https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6402072/ https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR67647 http://srodev.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/81554/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30854470/ https://core.ac.uk/download/201000284.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.13531.2,30854470,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.13531.2; 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.13531.1,2783186845,PMC6402072,0,000-950-612-687-915; 004-151-831-011-362; 008-419-535-639-040; 008-967-611-680-561; 011-071-337-623-412; 011-569-487-815-661; 011-689-964-472-742; 012-171-695-701-85X; 013-541-969-076-695; 016-113-618-336-617; 017-300-737-144-757; 020-726-263-014-788; 021-632-051-192-565; 021-705-042-773-370; 022-462-083-682-339; 023-216-452-628-403; 026-354-057-561-047; 027-492-121-712-711; 029-669-403-413-991; 031-540-312-730-611; 035-461-260-596-050; 036-777-322-956-822; 037-550-015-414-716; 037-622-957-634-253; 041-166-847-536-597; 048-129-942-521-643; 048-840-421-098-717; 053-950-741-615-38X; 054-157-999-318-369; 059-673-050-158-699; 062-212-979-552-667; 067-015-143-981-997; 085-320-250-288-390; 089-164-882-259-217; 089-946-657-072-954; 101-381-162-420-854; 112-893-461-858-07X; 118-769-736-534-227; 122-059-015-538-234; 135-478-515-852-340; 151-192-012-542-881; 162-725-859-796-180; 192-163-015-589-612,44

Wilkie,"Next-generation sequencing is a powerful tool for the discovery of genes related to neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Here, we report the identification of a distinct syndrome due to de novo or inherited heterozygous mutations in Tousled-like kinase 2 (TLK2) in 38 unrelated individuals and two affected mothers, using whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing technologies, matchmaker databases, and international collaborations. Affected individuals had a consistent phenotype, characterized by mild-borderline neurodevelopmental delay (86%), behavioral disorders (68%), severe gastro-intestinal problems (63%), and facial dysmorphism including blepharophimosis (82%), telecanthus (74%), prominent nasal bridge (68%), broad nasal tip (66%), thin vermilion of the upper lip (62%), and upslanting palpebral fissures (55%). Analysis of cell lines from three affected individuals showed that mutations act through a loss-of-function mechanism in at least two case subjects. Genotype-phenotype analysis and comparison of computationally modeled faces showed that phenotypes of these and other individuals with loss-of-function variants significantly overlapped with phenotypes of individuals with other variant types (missense and C-terminal truncating). This suggests that haploinsufficiency of TLK2 is the most likely underlying disease mechanism, leading to a consistent neurodevelopmental phenotype. This work illustrates the power of international data sharing, by the identification of 40 individuals from 26 different centers in 7 different countries, allowing the identification, clinical delineation, and genotype-phenotype evaluation of a distinct NDD caused by mutations in TLK2.",102,6,1195,1203,Loss function; Phenotype; Blepharophimosis; Telecanthus; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Genetics; Intellectual disability; Haploinsufficiency; Missense mutation; Biology,Tousled-like; facial averaging; haploinsufficiency; intellectual disability; kinase,"Adolescent; Adult; Base Sequence; Cell Line; Child; Child, Preschool; Facies; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Infant; Inheritance Patterns/genetics; Loss of Function Mutation/genetics; Male; Neurodevelopmental Disorders/genetics; Protein Kinases/genetics; RNA, Messenger/genetics; Translocation, Genetic; Young Adult","RNA, Messenger; Protein Kinases; protein kinase U",Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (102731/Z/13/Z) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M014568/1) United Kingdom; Department of Health (RP-2016-07-011) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5992133 https://www.imm.ox.ac.uk/publications/846588 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5992133 https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/portal/en/publications/de-novo-and-inherited-lossoffunction-variants-in-tlk2(694818f3-5c2c-4380-85f2-cc7867ebe360).html https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/publications/846588 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/107127 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/9sv477rx https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/255206 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29861108 https://escholarship.org/content/qt9sv477rx/qt9sv477rx.pdf?t=qamu4d https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/846588 http://www.cell.com/ajhg/supplemental/S0002-9297(18)30161-7 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/de-novo-and-inherited-lossoffunction-variants-in-tlk2(fe8b212f-2503-46bf-be54-a78ca9142a90)/export.html https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(18)30161-7 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/421446/ https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F377026 http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/377026 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929718301617 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/107127/REPUB_107127_OA.pdf https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/846588 https://core.ac.uk/download/200272876.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.014,29861108,10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.014,2805234304,PMC5992133,0,003-041-934-079-542; 005-316-160-366-582; 009-995-008-408-883; 014-492-401-302-897; 016-811-648-004-320; 017-177-001-454-874; 017-948-347-251-321; 026-004-905-500-31X; 033-956-294-134-665; 037-873-175-628-760; 044-428-107-840-450; 053-317-298-500-129; 058-951-057-142-770; 060-882-750-212-920; 066-482-050-716-226; 085-541-313-340-627; 120-477-070-254-188; 126-368-122-664-759; 127-016-670-476-238; 131-423-542-523-282; 136-438-980-311-929,21

Partly in response to these challenges, various models of public involvement in research are being introduced. Yet, the ways in which public involvement should meet governance challenges are not well understood. We conducted a qualitative study with 36 experts and stakeholders using the World Cafe method to identify key governance challenges and explore how public involvement can meet these challenges. This brief report discusses four cross-cutting themes from the study: the need to move beyond individual consent; issues in benefit and data sharing; the challenge of delineating and understanding publics; and the goal of clarifying justifications for public involvement. The report aims to provide a starting point for making sense of the relationship between public involvement and the governance of population-level biomedical research, showing connections, potential solutions and issues arising at their intersection. We suggest that, in population-level biomedical research, there is a pressing need for a shift away from conventional governance frameworks focused on the individual and towards a focus on collectives, as well as to foreground ethical issues around social justice and develop ways to address cultural diversity, value pluralism and competing stakeholder interests. There are many unresolved questions around how this shift could be realised, but these unresolved questions should form the basis for developing justificatory accounts and frameworks for suitable collective models of public involvement in population-level biomedical research governance.",47,7,522,525,Cultural diversity; Research ethics; Political science; Qualitative research; Stakeholder; Population health; Value pluralism; Data sharing; Corporate governance; Engineering ethics,decision-making; public health ethics; regulation; research ethics,,,Wellcome Trust; Wellcome Trust; Wellcome Trust,https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1128402 https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2020/10/06/medethics-2020-106530 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/173111099/ErikainenSEtAlJME2020PublicInvolvementInTheGoverneance.pdf https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/public-involvement-in-the-governance-of-population-level-biomedic https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/167328/ https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/items/14bf0ba7-b964-44fa-a9d8-236f99b11aa8/1/ https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/publications/1128402 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33023977 https://philpapers.org/rec/ERIPII https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3103939/ https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/public-involvement-in-the-governance-of-populationlevel-biomedical-research(cf0eca77-444a-4ed8-83ee-db903424e021).html https://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/31226/ https://jme.bmj.com/content/47/7/522 https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/1128402 https://www.weh.ox.ac.uk/publications/1128402 https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/173111099/ErikainenSEtAlJME2020PublicInvolvementInTheGoverneance.pdf https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/file/14bf0ba7-b964-44fa-a9d8-236f99b11aa8/1/medethics-2020-106530.full.pdf https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/47/7/522.full.pdf https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2020/10/06/medethics-2020-106530.info https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8677066 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8677066/file/8677067.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/341797389.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106530,33023977,10.1136/medethics-2020-106530,3081642488,,0,000-269-263-939-258; 008-886-087-736-332; 009-700-049-567-169; 012-837-278-292-563; 018-593-265-151-614; 021-095-227-397-599; 023-876-702-126-822; 029-086-175-099-915; 029-333-400-505-701; 030-980-229-168-894; 034-433-503-451-944; 045-514-273-410-162; 047-704-439-419-053; 061-162-442-968-129; 066-396-973-780-620; 069-585-756-783-536; 072-016-705-913-300; 096-327-747-748-955; 104-253-721-915-830; 106-882-621-105-245; 114-658-000-212-025; 121-058-829-908-192; 135-723-083-845-126; 159-419-297-422-289; 194-149-788-700-548,7

Morris; Amanda J. Neville; Ciarán Nicholl; Judith Rankin; Anke Rissmann; David Tucker; Simona Martin,"The European Commission through its Directorates-General Joint Research Centre (DG JRC) and Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) is developing the European Platform on Rare Diseases Registration (EU RD Platform) with the objective to set European-level standards for data collection and data sharing. In the field of rare diseases the EU RD Platform will be a source of information on available rare disease patient data with large transnational European coverage. One main function of the EU RD Platform is to enable interoperability for the >600 existing RD registries in Europe. The second function is to offer a sustainable solution for two large European surveillance networks: European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) and Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE). EUROCAT is European network of population-based registries for the epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies. It covers about one third of the European birth population. The Central Database contains about 800,000 cases with congenital anomalies among livebirths, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy, reported using the same standardised classification and coding. These high quality data enables epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies, which includes estimating prevalence, prenatal diagnosis and perinatal mortality rates and the detection of teratogenic exposures among others. The network also develops recommendations for primary prevention in the Rare Diseases National Plans for medicinal drugs, food/nutrition, lifestyle, health services, and environmental pollution. The network has received the European Commission's support since its inception. In order to offer a sustainable solution for the continuation of EUROCAT activities, it was agreed that EUROCAT would become part of the EU RD Platform. In 2015, the European level-coordination activities and the Central Database were transferred to the DG JRC, where the JRC-EUROCAT Central Registry is now located. This paper describes the functioning of EUROCAT in the new setting, and gives an overview of the activities and the organisation of the JRC-EUROCAT Central Registry.",61,9,513,517,Business; Interoperability; Data quality; Rare disease; Data sharing; Population; Environmental pollution; Central database; Joint research; Medical emergency,Congenital anomalies; EU RD Platform; EUROCAT; JRC-EUROCAT Central Registry; Surveillance,Congenital Abnormalities/diagnosis; Epidemiological Monitoring; Europe; Humans; Prenatal Diagnosis/statistics & numerical data; Rare Diseases/diagnosis; Registries,,Medical Research Council (MR/K02325X/1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29597096 https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC111205 https://findresearcher.sdu.dk:8443/ws/files/151944511/A_sustainable_solution_for_the_activities_of_the_European_network_for_surveillance_of_congenital_anomalies.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29597096/ http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/45952 https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/249110 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1769721218301824#! https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/a-sustainable-solution-for-the-activities-of-the-european-network https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/249110/6D969DEE-B576-4817-AF7A-EB0BEFDBA4B4.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1769721218301824 https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/publications/a-sustainable-solution-for-the-activities-of-the-european-network https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29597096,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmg.2018.03.008,29597096,10.1016/j.ejmg.2018.03.008,2795244504,,0,071-604-460-182-507; 073-416-499-630-754; 094-571-673-898-329; 115-970-772-892-22X,20

Steeden; Bejal Pandya; Oliver Tann; Vivek Muthurangu,"Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is generally performed during a long breath-hold (BH), limiting its utility in infants and small children. This study proposes a free-breathing (FB) time resolved MRA (TRA) technique for use in pediatric and adult congenital heart disease (CHD). A TRA sequence was developed by combining spiral trajectories with sensitivity encoding (SENSE, x4 kx-ky and x2 kz) and partial Fourier (75% in kz). As no temporal data sharing is used, an independent 3D data set was acquired every ~1.3s, with acceptable spatial resolution (~2.3x2.3x2.3mm). The technique was tested during FB over 50 consecutive volumes. Conventional BH-MRA and FB-TRA data was acquired in 45 adults and children with CHD. We calculated quantitative image quality for both sequences. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed in all patients from both sequences. Additionally, vessel measurements were made at the sinotubular junction (N = 43), proximal descending aorta (N = 43), descending aorta at the level of the diaphragm (N = 43), main pulmonary artery (N = 35), left pulmonary artery (N = 35) and the right pulmonary artery (N = 35). Intra and inter observer variability was assessed in a subset of 10 patients. BH-MRA had significantly higher homogeneity in non-contrast enhancing tissue (coefficient of variance, P  0.988, P<0.0001), with negligible biases (between -0.2 and +0.1mm) and small limits of agreement (between -2.4 and +2.5mm). We have described a FB-TRA technique that is shown to enable accurate diagnosis and vessel measures compared to conventional BH-MRA.

1513,020-985-891-232-90X,Fair trade in building digital knowledge repositories: the knowledge economy as if researchers mattered.,2020-07-18,2020,journal article,"Medicine, health care, and philosophy",15728633; 13867423,Springer Netherlands,Netherlands,Giovanni De Grandis,"Both a significant body of literature and the case study presented here show that digital knowledge repositories struggle to attract the needed level of data and knowledge contribution that they need to be successful. This happens also to high profile and prestigious initiatives. The paper argues that the reluctance of researchers to contribute can only be understood in light of the highly competitive context in which research careers need to be built nowadays and how this affects researchers' quality of life. Competition and managerialism limit the discretion of researchers in sharing their results and in donating their working time. A growing corpus of research shows that academic researchers are increasingly overworked and highly stressed. This corroborates the point that the room for undertaking additional tasks with future and uncertain benefits is very limited. The paper thus recommends that promoters of digital knowledge repositories focus on the needs of the researchers who are expected to contribute their knowledge. In order to treat them fairly and to ensure the success of the repositories, knowledge sharing needs to be rewarded so as to improve the working conditions of contributors. In order to help implementing this researcher-centred approach, the paper proposes the idea of expediential trust: rewards for contributing should be such that rational, self-interested researchers would freely decide to contribute their knowledge and effort trusting that this would make them better off.",23,4,549,563,Business; Knowledge economy; Knowledge sharing; Discretion; Managerialism; Data sharing; Context (language use); Competition (economics); Fair trade; Knowledge management,Competition in research; Data sharing; Expediential trust; Incentives and rewards; Knowledge repositories,Biomedical Research/organization & administration; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Information Storage and Retrieval/standards; Knowledge; Research Personnel/psychology; Trust,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (201576/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11019-020-09966-z.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683609 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32683609/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683609 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11019-020-09966-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11019-020-09966-z,32683609,10.1007/s11019-020-09966-z,3043517279,PMC7538398,0,000-785-692-812-344; 004-606-473-357-504; 006-136-195-676-319; 007-961-704-505-793; 010-980-348-868-45X; 011-133-527-210-695; 012-028-313-539-796; 014-654-363-053-744; 015-724-916-410-041; 019-666-634-530-953; 025-754-391-168-896; 026-759-949-699-557; 030-236-847-130-732; 041-283-699-625-784; 050-423-833-385-805; 051-129-064-679-858; 052-973-662-924-147; 058-023-520-461-000; 059-274-407-495-754; 059-814-083-797-792; 060-713-609-759-751; 060-871-712-542-407; 061-710-670-611-214; 063-156-205-440-998; 065-531-114-344-217; 066-447-949-313-288; 066-566-186-373-822; 071-351-959-345-245; 077-412-331-718-549; 080-679-506-500-519; 081-894-354-341-798; 083-349-818-682-005; 085-192-755-643-091; 085-523-319-774-128; 085-882-649-708-806; 092-568-969-334-629; 094-045-038-152-296; 102-678-245-650-712; 112-640-902-495-230; 116-636-432-049-909; 119-103-938-872-588; 120-358-379-855-916; 127-873-355-988-969; 129-452-028-225-101; 134-842-552-531-636; 136-637-806-363-792; 138-462-313-540-093; 139-804-474-424-02X; 139-880-806-283-222; 140-720-500-450-799; 145-592-902-180-291; 160-606-043-902-329; 162-885-347-099-27X; 164-639-063-430-206; 174-355-551-986-578; 177-630-020-326-071; 178-387-647-443-043; 179-129-972-379-545; 188-390-579-858-06X,1

Francis; Ursula McKenna,"AbstractFor the first time in 2001 the Census for England and Wales included a question on religious identity. The campaign for the inclusion of this question was largely pioneered by the Muslim community who argued that religious identity was a more significant indicator of social and public significance than ethnicity. This paper tests the thesis that Muslim identity predicts distinctive values of public and social significance among male adolescents (13–15 years of age) who participated in a survey conducted across the four nations of the United Kingdom. From the 11,870 participants in the survey the present analysis compares the responses of 158 male students who self-identified as Muslim with the responses of 1932 male students who self-identified as religiously unaffiliated. Comparisons are drawn across two domains defined as religiosity and as social values. The data demonstrated that for these male adolescents self-identification as Muslim encased a distinctive profile in terms both of religiosity...",43,5,550,565,Gender studies; Ethnic group; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Self-concept; Identity (social science); Religiosity; Religious identity; Census; Social value orientations; Social psychology,,,,AHRC; ESRC,https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/85388 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1156449 https://core.ac.uk/display/74227933 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03054985.2017.1352351 https://core.ac.uk/download/74227933.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2017.1352351,,10.1080/03054985.2017.1352351,2595070446,,0,002-723-485-281-869; 004-078-414-818-853; 018-726-790-313-163; 035-068-573-796-431; 036-897-048-897-597; 038-152-003-078-025; 062-055-208-293-971; 062-525-670-567-42X; 091-507-124-381-065; 104-312-074-971-47X; 132-356-039-021-321; 159-777-574-120-917,5

Such collaboration needs open research practices and the sharing of research outputs, such as data and code, thereby facilitating research and research reproducibility and timely collaboration beyond borders. The Research Data Alliance COVID-19 Working Group recently published a set of recommendations and guidelines on data sharing and related best practices for COVID-19 research. These guidelines include recommendations for clinicians, researchers, policy- and decision-makers, funders, publishers, public health experts, disaster preparedness and response experts, infrastructure providers from the perspective of different domains (Clinical Medicine, Omics, Epidemiology, Social Sciences, Community Participation, Indigenous Peoples, Research Software, Legal and Ethical Considerations), and other potential users. These guidelines include recommendations for researchers, policymakers, funders, publishers and infrastructure providers from the perspective of different domains (Clinical Medicine, Omics, Epidemiology, Social Sciences, Community Participation, Indigenous Peoples, Research Software, Legal and Ethical Considerations). Several overarching themes have emerged from this document such as the need to balance the creation of data adherent to FAIR principles (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable), with the need for quick data release; the use of trustworthy research data repositories; the use of well-annotated data with meaningful metadata; and practices of documenting methods and software. The resulting document marks an unprecedented cross-disciplinary, cross-sectoral, and cross-jurisdictional effort authored by over 160 experts from around the globe. This letter summarises key points of the Recommendations and Guidelines, highlights the relevant findings, shines a spotlight on the process, and suggests how these developments can be leveraged by the wider scientific community.",5,,267,267,Best practice; Interoperability; Open science; Alliance; Open research; Data sharing; Public relations; Indigenous; Metadata,COVID-19; Clinical Research; Epidemiology; FAIR and CARE principles; Omics; Open science; Sharing research outputs in pandemics caused by infectious diseases; Social Science,,,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo; European Commission; Horizon 2020; Horizon 2020; University of Michigan; National Institute on Drug Abuse; Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie; National Science Foundation; Université de Bordeaux; Canadian Cancer Genome Collaboratory; Wellcome Trust; Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501381 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33501381/ https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR348050 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501381 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7808050.2 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-267/v1/xml https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-267,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16378.2,33501381,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16378.2; 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16378.1,3105389930,PMC7808050,0,000-168-847-716-864; 000-706-998-073-523; 012-156-299-752-879; 015-921-453-687-29X; 017-778-021-326-785; 018-323-572-748-832; 018-722-208-916-746; 022-526-129-975-007; 022-614-730-453-98X; 024-597-570-268-179; 037-719-410-794-924; 050-494-317-964-825; 070-462-022-251-464; 074-604-840-769-931; 074-775-615-417-872; 077-286-743-641-846; 090-916-576-640-890; 094-312-872-295-882; 116-865-359-054-849; 131-652-122-533-862; 180-462-482-759-611; 194-629-919-890-525,2

Unfortunately, the technological and methodological advances of the past two decades have outpaced the accrual of data, which is particularly challenging given the relatively few centers that have the necessary facilities and capabilities. The PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) addresses this challenge by aggregating independently acquired non-human primate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets and openly sharing them via the International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI). Here, we present the rationale, design, and procedures for the PRIME-DE consortium, as well as the initial release, consisting of 25 independent data collections aggregated across 22 sites (total = 217 non-human primates). We also outline the unique pitfalls and challenges that should be considered in the analysis of non-human primate MRI datasets, including providing automated quality assessment of the contributed datasets.",100,1,61,74,Data exchange;

Siemieniuch; Ella-Mae Hubbard,"© 2017, © IMechE 2017. Introduction of new technology (technology implementation) within an organisation can have wide reaching implications, beyond the effectiveness and efficiency savings that are typically the aim of such an endeavour. The ‘Health and Prognostic Assessment of Railway Assets for Predictive Maintenance’ project developed a prognostic tool, which aimed to support enhancement of the London underground’s remote condition monitoring system to support change from reactive and preventative to predictive maintenance, in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency and reduce lost customer hours. This paper investigates the organisational challenges associated with the introduction of such a tool. The paper describes the approach adopted to model the extant maintenance processes (focusing on role mapping) and associated organisational structures which revealed issues such as unclear processes, poor communication and data sharing links and problems with delineation of responsibility for decision making. It also describes the development of a new maintenance process model that incorporates the additional functionality of the new prognostic tool, taking in to account changes of roles, responsibilities, organisational processes and activities.",231,10,1174,1185,Extant taxon; Order (exchange); Process management; Condition monitoring; Data sharing; Technology implementation; Organisational change; Computer science; Process (engineering); Predictive maintenance,,,,Innovate UK,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/From_preventative_to_predictive_maintenance_The_organisational_challenge/9633023/1 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954409717701785 https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/From_preventative_to_predictive_maintenance_The_organisational_challenge/9633023 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0954409717701785,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0954409717701785,,10.1177/0954409717701785,2614018686,,0,001-359-697-761-229; 001-976-855-372-856; 007-057-627-801-330; 010-049-148-037-214; 015-913-520-671-117; 017-719-852-283-747; 021-807-600-514-208; 026-864-956-866-223; 042-069-661-081-952; 047-658-942-628-798; 049-201-545-600-639; 072-851-979-998-929; 075-500-778-280-317; 105-513-670-267-136; 121-903-342-281-370; 147-714-995-902-016; 166-854-343-711-189,10

Empirical evidence on the dynamics of reliance on scientists and public health authorities during the early phases of an epidemic outbreak is limited. We examine these processes during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy by leveraging data from Twitter and two online surveys, including a survey experiment. We find that reliance on experts followed a curvilinear path. Both Twitter and survey data showed initial increases in information-seeking from expert sources in the three weeks after the detection of the first case. Consistent with these increases, knowledge about health information linked to COVID-19 and support for containment measures was widespread, and better knowledge was associated with stronger support for containment policies. Both knowledge and containment support were positively associated with trust in science and public health authorities. However, in the third week after the outbreak, we detected a slowdown in responsiveness to experts. These processes were corroborated with a survey experiment, which showed that those holding incorrect beliefs about COVID-19 gave no greater – or even lower – importance to information when its source was stated as coming from experts than when the source was unstated. Our results suggest weakened trust in public health authorities with prolonged exposure to the epidemic as a potential mechanism for this effect. Weakened responsiveness to expert sources may increase susceptibility to misinformation and our results call for efforts to sustain trust in adapting public health response.",13,,100721,100721,Outbreak; Public health; Social studies; Empirical evidence; Survey data collection; Misinformation; Public relations; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Pandemic,Epidemics; Infectious disease outbreaks; Information-seeking responses and reliance; Pandemics; Public health; Trust in health authorities; Trust in science,,,"Leverhulme Trust; Nuffield College, University of Oxford",https://repository.supsi.ch/12250/ https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-989265 https://air.unipr.it/handle/11381/2885839 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100721 https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:14d2ac10-1ae7-4efe-8aa4-3b9363ed809e https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7859315 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7859315/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235282732030358X https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S235282732030358X https://boa.unimib.it/handle/10281/305080 http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100721,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100721,33553567,10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100721,3115792974,PMC7859315,0,000-395-561-947-843; 002-302-010-980-10X; 004-762-794-690-556; 007-268-419-125-606; 009-002-602-419-906; 010-083-281-885-553; 010-681-456-540-187; 017-934-315-543-162; 024-045-605-726-091; 025-592-063-211-542; 027-819-409-909-339; 028-854-372-195-618; 029-029-002-740-224; 031-104-159-961-956; 036-069-695-978-488; 036-722-986-046-786; 044-673-507-606-144; 045-185-932-853-190; 049-066-409-249-849; 050-981-185-683-922; 051-353-711-106-412; 051-684-662-823-12X; 056-006-599-468-848; 058-489-960-234-674; 059-609-885-846-637; 062-188-125-568-983; 069-925-866-594-128; 070-183-084-816-30X; 075-731-761-310-100; 079-292-803-228-011; 083-405-115-398-079; 083-880-796-070-935; 084-814-388-676-701; 095-496-093-673-819; 111-631-194-906-762; 111-916-631-163-266; 112-640-902-495-230; 115-047-798-644-356; 117-856-566-119-133; 119-600-662-451-412; 123-185-302-096-110; 123-900-249-782-866; 124-505-952-469-800; 126-170-738-326-770; 143-763-575-844-812; 166-254-294-243-50X,10

F. Fraser; John Powell; Chris Paton,"As healthcare facilities in Low- and Middle-Income Countries adopt digital health systems to improve hospital administration and patient care, it is important to understand the adoption process and assess the systems’ capabilities. This survey aimed to provide decision-makers with information on the digital health systems landscape and to support the rapidly developing digital health community in Kenya and the region by sharing knowledge. We conducted a survey of County Health Records Information Officers (CHRIOs) to determine the extent to which digital health systems in public hospitals that serve as internship training centres in Kenya are adopted. We conducted site visits and interviewed hospital administrators and end users who were at the facility on the day of the visit. We also interviewed digital health system vendors to understand the adoption process from their perspective. Semi-structured interview guides adapted from the literature were used. We identified emergent themes using a thematic analysis from the data. We obtained information from 39 CHRIOs, 58 hospital managers and system users, and 9 digital health system vendors through semi-structured interviews and completed questionnaires. From the survey, all facilities mentioned purchased a digital health system primarily for administrative purposes. Radiology and laboratory management systems were commonly standalone systems and there were varying levels of interoperability within facilities that had multiple systems. We only saw one in-patient clinical module in use. Users reported on issues such as system usability, inadequate training, infrastructure and system support. Vendors reported the availability of a wide range of modules, but implementation was constrained by funding, prioritisation of services, users’ lack of confidence in new technologies and lack of appropriate data sharing policies. Public hospitals in Kenya are increasingly purchasing systems to support administrative functions and this study highlights challenges faced by hospital users and vendors.

Walesby; Chris Wilkinson; Simon Conroy; Chris P Gale; Marlous Hall; Kate Walters; Andrew Clegg,"The past three decades have seen a steady increase in the availability of routinely collected health and social care data and the processing power to analyse it. These developments represent a major opportunity for ageing research, especially with the integration of different datasets across traditional boundaries of health and social care, for prognostic research and novel evaluations of interventions with representative populations of older people. However, there are considerable challenges in using routine data at the level of coding, data analysis and in the application of findings to everyday care. New Horizons in applying routine data to investigate novel questions in ageing research require a collaborative approach between clinicians, data scientists, biostatisticians, epidemiologists and trial methodologists. This requires building capacity for the next generation of research leaders in this important area. There is a need to develop consensus code lists and standardised, validated algorithms for common conditions and outcomes that are relevant for older people to maximise the potential of routine data research in this group. Lastly, we must help drive the application of routine data to improve the care of older people, through the development of novel methods for evaluation of interventions using routine data infrastructure. We believe that harnessing routine data can help address knowledge gaps for older people living with multiple conditions and frailty, and design interventions and pathways of care to address the complex health issues we face in caring for older people.",49,5,716,722,Health informatics; Coding (social sciences); Psychological intervention; Data Linkage; New horizons; Social care; Older people; Medical education; Medicine; Big data,ageing; big data; data linkage; electronic health records; health informatics; older people,Aged; Aging; Frailty/diagnosis; Humans; Social Support,,"The Dunhill Medical Trust (RTF107/0117) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (206,470/Z/17/Z) United Kingdom",https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa56446/Download/56446__19530__90af740c14d34b9c88e58aad03a85091.pdf https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa56446 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/206094/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32043136/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32043136 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444666 https://academic.oup.com/ageing/article/49/5/716/5733068 https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/262352 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32043136 https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/155756/ https://core.ac.uk/download/286316875.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa018,32043136,10.1093/ageing/afaa018,2996440563,PMC7444666,0,001-625-857-182-007; 007-642-613-019-185; 007-940-276-869-335; 010-222-991-684-139; 013-156-017-391-013; 014-281-091-480-873; 015-162-092-047-769; 015-218-255-036-07X; 015-886-340-589-14X; 017-519-511-114-076; 018-083-633-946-649; 018-576-555-738-347; 030-842-566-239-512; 031-510-346-285-651; 035-813-476-891-880; 035-914-360-357-822; 039-636-930-747-450; 060-718-995-674-774; 061-828-997-345-484; 062-302-932-826-80X; 063-754-711-330-396; 064-646-752-381-358; 075-834-762-928-051; 078-580-501-812-837; 079-096-069-997-124; 085-320-250-288-390; 135-280-745-384-251; 160-743-165-845-052,13

Quinlan; Petr Holub; Kaisa Silander,"Introduction: The Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing (MIABIS) was initiated in 2012. MIABIS aims to create a common biobank terminology to facilitate data sharing in biobanks and sample collections. The MIABIS Core terminology consists of three components describing biobanks, sample collections, and studies, in which information on samples and sample donors is provided at aggregated form. However, there is also a need to describe samples and sample donors at an individual level to allow more elaborate queries on available biobank samples and data. Therefore the MIABIS terminology has now been extended with components describing samples and sample donors at an individual level. Materials and Methods: The components were defined according to specific scope and use cases by a large group of experts, and through several cycles of reviews, according to the new MIABIS governance model of BBMRI-ERIC (Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium). The guiding principles applied in developing these components included the following terms: model should consider only samples of human origin, model should be applicable to all types of samples and all sample donors, and model should describe the current status of samples stored in a given biobank. Results: A minimal set of standard attributes for defining samples and sample donors is presented here. We added an ""event"" component to describe attributes that are not directly describing samples or sample donors but are tightly related to them. To better utilize the generic data model, we suggest a procedure by which interoperability can be promoted, using specific MIABIS profiles. Discussion: The MIABIS sample and donor component extensions and the new generic data model complement the existing MIABIS Core 2.0 components, and substantially increase the potential usability of this terminology for better describing biobank samples and sample donors. They also support the use of individual level data about samples and sample donors to obtain accurate and detailed biobank availability queries.",18,3,155,164,Biobank; Usability; Standardization; Interoperability; Information retrieval; Data sharing; Computer science; Sample (statistics); Terminology; Data model,MIABIS; biobank; interoperability; sample; sample donor; standardization,Biological Specimen Banks; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Terminology as Topic,,Medical Research Council (MR/R022488/1) United Kingdom,https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/bio.2019.0129 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302498 https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/extending-the-minimum-information-about-biobank-data-sharing-term https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32302498/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7310316 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F085d24bd-42bb-4302-9482-f7d0f365fdd0 https://researchinformation.amsterdamumc.org/en/publications/extending-the-minimum-information-about-biobank-data-sharing-term,http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/bio.2019.0129,32302498,10.1089/bio.2019.0129,3016675806,PMC7310316,0,000-122-428-211-630; 003-415-549-686-85X; 003-766-637-602-93X; 008-303-873-646-02X; 011-943-322-663-564; 014-284-413-074-346; 019-441-721-347-156; 020-029-988-262-822; 022-491-249-147-09X; 024-169-216-614-605; 033-196-841-157-972; 057-070-181-676-28X; 070-458-669-032-738; 070-462-022-251-464; 071-783-950-122-343; 076-119-461-626-731; 078-079-365-493-464; 079-472-112-130-750; 133-814-703-170-571; 179-832-165-754-227,9

McEachan,"Background : The roll out of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are underway in the UK, and ensuring good uptake in vulnerable communities will be critical to reducing hospital admissions and deaths. There is emerging evidence that vaccine hesitancy is higher in ethnic minorities and deprived areas, and that this may be caused by distrust and misinformation in the community.  This study aims to understand COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in an ethnically diverse and deprived population of Bradford through the Born in Bradford (BiB) research programme. Methods : Surveys were sent to parents in BiB who had taken part in a previous Covid-19 survey (n=1727). Cross tabulations explored variation by ethnicity and deprivation. Answers to a question asking the main reason for hesitancy was analysed using thematic analysis. Results : 535 (31%) of those invited between 29 th October-9 th December 2020 participated. 48% were White British, 37% Pakistani heritage and 15% from other ethnicities; 46% were from the most deprived quintile of the Index of Multiple Deprivation. 29% of respondents do want a vaccine, 10% do not. The majority had not thought about it (29%) or were unsure (30%). Vaccine hesitancy differed by ethnicity and deprivation: 43% (95% CIs: 37-54%) of White British and 60% (35-81%) in the least deprived areas do want a vaccine, compared to 13% (9-19%) of Pakistani heritage and 20% (15-26%) in the most deprived areas. Reasons for not wanting a vaccine were commonly explained by confusion and distrust which was linked to exposure to misinformation. Conclusions : There is a risk of unequitable roll out of the vaccination programme in the UK with higher vaccine hesitancy in ethnic minorities and those living in deprived areas. There is an urgent need to tackle misinformation that is leading to uncertainty and confusion about the vaccines.",6,,23,,Ethnic group; Demography; Poverty; Vaccination; Misinformation; Population; White British; Medicine; Thematic analysis; Social determinants of health,,,,Wellcome Trust; National Institute for Health Research; The Health Foundation; UK Prevention Research Partnership Consortium,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-23/v2/xml https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-23 https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR278132,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16576.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16576.1,3127825392,,0,021-477-889-579-707; 030-119-981-859-118; 032-297-977-184-909; 037-317-749-249-405; 037-550-015-414-716; 047-015-297-308-601; 051-103-457-979-645; 060-056-463-733-956; 098-166-229-243-357; 135-917-909-006-245,8

Despite increasing initiatives for maximising benefits of data linkage, significant challenges remain, including a culture of caution around data sharing and linkage, failure to make use of flexibilities within the law and failure to incorporate intelligent iterative design. The article identifies key issues for consideration and posits a flexible and accessible governance model that provides a robust and efficient means of paying due regard to both privacy and the public interests in research. We argue that proportionate governance based on clear guiding principles accurately gauges risks associated with data uses and assigns safeguards accordingly. This requires a clear articulation of roles and responsibilities at all levels of decision-making and effective training for researchers and data custodians. Accordingly, the PPGM encourages and supports defensible judgements about data linkage in the public interest.",13,2-3,168,204,Information privacy; Information governance; Law; eHealth; Public interest; Guiding Principles; Custodians; Data sharing; Corporate governance; Computer science; Knowledge management,Information governance; data linkage; eHealth; principles; proportionality; research,,,Medical Research Council (MR/K007017/1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634569 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0968533213508974 http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/14477533/Medical_Law_International_2013_Sethi_168_204.pdf https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0968533213508974 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/delivering-proportionate-governance-in-the-era-of-ehealth-making- http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3952593 https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/14477533/Medical_Law_International_2013_Sethi_168_204.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24634569/ https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/delivering-proportionate-governance-in-the-era-of-ehealth(f119b0f6-7f24-410e-8165-8a926bfad758).html http://mli.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/11/25/0968533213508974.abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/28973712.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0968533213508974,24634569,10.1177/0968533213508974,2150198788,PMC3952593,0,,39

Governments and research funders world-wide are recognizing this potential and making major investments in data-intensive initiatives. However, there are challenges to overcome so that safe, socially-acceptable data sharing can be achieved. This paper outlines the field of population data science, the International Population Data Linkage Network (IPDLN), and their roles in advancing data-intensive research. We provide an overview of core concepts and major challenges for data-intensive research, with a particular focus on ethical, legal, and societal implications (ELSI). Using international case studies, we show how challenges can be addressed and lessons learned in advancing the safe, socially-acceptable use of population data for public benefit. Based on the case studies, we discuss the common ELSI principles in operation, we illustrate examples of a data scrutiny panel and a consumer panel, and we propose a set of ELSI-based recommendations to inform new and developing data-intensive initiatives.We conclude that although there are many ELSI issues to be overcome, there has never been a better time or more potential to leverage the benefits of population data for public benefit. A variety of initiatives, with different operating models, have pioneered the way in addressing many challenges. However, the work is not static, as the ELSI environment is constantly evolving, thus requiring continual mutual learning and improvement via the IPDLN and beyond.",40,,1,6,Variety (cybernetics); Health informatics; Work (electrical); Scrutiny; Value (ethics); Leverage (negotiation); Data sharing; Engineering ethics; Medicine; Big data,Big data; Data science; International Population Data Linkage Network; Medical informatics,Data Science; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval/ethics; Internationality; Public Health; Risk Assessment,,Medical Research Council (MR/K006525/1) United Kingdom,https://childstudies.org/journal/view.php?number=1014 https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa48319 https://jksqm.jatsxml.org/journal/view.php?number=1014 https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa48319/Download/0048319-07022019121250.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30703857 http://e-ajbc.org/journal/view.php?number=1014 http://journal.conservation.or.kr/journal/view.php?number=1014 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30703857/ https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/30703857 https://www.e-epih.org/journal/view.php?number=1014 https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002416473 http://dspace.kci.go.kr/handle/kci/590202 https://core.ac.uk/download/187088848.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2018061,30703857,10.4178/epih.e2018061,2905735277,PMC6367205,0,018-426-391-090-527; 019-341-996-717-699; 021-719-302-615-035; 041-269-214-799-516; 052-647-513-500-400; 057-160-157-019-377; 057-317-748-898-134; 058-957-954-952-631; 085-320-250-288-390; 092-823-846-804-251; 121-233-918-525-957; 162-725-859-796-180,13

Hatch,"Objective COVID-19-related inequities experienced by racial and ethnic minority groups including healthcare professionals mirror wider health inequities, which risk being perpetuated by lower uptake of vaccination. We aim to better understand lower uptake among racial and ethnic minority staff groups to inform initiatives to enhance uptake. Design Twenty-five semi-structured interviews were conducted (October 2020-January 2021) with UK-based healthcare staff. Data were inductively and thematically analysed. Results Vaccine decision-making processes were underpinned by an overarching theme, 'weighing up risks of harm against potential benefits to self and others'. Sub-themes included 'fear of harm', 'moral/ethical objections', 'potential benefits to self and others', 'information and misinformation', and 'institutional or workplace pressure'. We identified ways in which these were weighted more heavily towards vaccine hesitancy for racial and ethnic minority staff groups influenced by perceptions about institutional and structural discrimination. This included suspicions and fear around institutional pressure to be vaccinated, racial injustices in vaccine development and testing, religious or ethical concerns, and legitimacy and accessibility of vaccine messaging and communication. Conclusions Drawing on a critical race perspective, we conclude that acknowledging historical and contemporary abuses of power is essential to avoid perpetuating and aggravating mistrust by de-contextualising hesitancy from the social processes affecting hesitancy, undermining efforts to increase vaccine uptake.",,,1,20,Ethnic group; Psychology; Health care; Qualitative research; Vaccination; Power (social and political); Misinformation; Harm; Legitimacy; Criminology,COVID-19; Race; discrimination; ethnicity; healthcare staff; vaccine hesitancy,,,Economic and Social Research Council; Wellcome Trust,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13557858.2021.1936464 https://covid19.elsevierpure.com/tr/publications/race-ethnicity-and-covid-19-vaccination-a-qualitative-study-of-uk https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/race-ethnicity-and-covid19-vaccination-a-qualitative-study-of-uk-healthcare-staff(f6e25ead-82f5-4aba-8631-c490f1d68c95).html https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2021.1936464 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13557858.2021.1936464 http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2021.1936464 https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/26407/ https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/153504118/Vaccine_hesitancy_Ethnicity_and_Health_ACCEPTED.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34092149 https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/es/covidwho-1258690 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34092149/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13557858.2021.1936464,34092149,10.1080/13557858.2021.1936464,3165951557,,0,002-840-258-638-082; 004-701-347-709-973; 005-547-351-501-204; 007-106-909-147-128; 008-923-265-812-706; 011-475-722-015-713; 016-865-544-853-743; 021-970-764-305-381; 022-528-505-052-994; 022-686-126-914-869; 025-197-646-308-127; 026-009-110-919-312; 030-002-787-408-699; 031-248-949-626-901; 031-647-196-166-282; 035-433-365-909-422; 036-379-695-597-929; 037-529-975-319-293; 042-569-715-690-202; 043-919-546-256-483; 053-476-812-647-640; 055-388-945-747-824; 057-068-370-903-880; 058-261-892-880-496; 060-316-839-543-615; 062-473-130-799-199; 063-527-513-557-872; 070-745-550-950-648; 074-357-099-848-155; 078-904-063-960-642; 082-042-044-371-576; 093-705-229-674-833; 108-079-630-264-045; 115-683-168-751-39X; 145-861-142-440-662; 149-053-972-648-139; 191-565-273-774-322,4

CARD is ontologically structured, model centric, and spans the breadth of AMR drug classes and resistance mechanisms, including intrinsic, mutation-driven and acquired resistance. It is built upon the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (ARO), a custom built, interconnected and hierarchical controlled vocabulary allowing advanced data sharing and organization. Its design allows the development of novel genome analysis tools, such as the Resistance Gene Identifier (RGI) for resistome prediction from raw genome sequence. Recent improvements include extensive curation of additional reference sequences and mutations, development of a unique Model Ontology and accompanying AMR detection models to power sequence analysis, new visualization tools, and expansion of the RGI for detection of emergent AMR threats.

Bovensiepen; Mathijs Pelkmans,"What are the politics of ignorance in an age of misinformation? How can the concept of ‘wilful blindness’ help us to understand the logics involved? We start the introduction to this special issue by arguing that the intrinsic instability of wilful blindness draws valuable attention to the graded nature of intentionality and perception, and the tensions between them. These features are an essential part of the workings of ignorance, as we illustrate with reference to the shifting intentions of drug couriers, the fleeting moments in which the humanity of victims is recognised in the midst of violent acts, and the affects that channel economic behaviour, such as in the subprime mortgage crisis. When approaching perception and intentionality as complexly entangled in institutionalised fields of power, ‘wilful blindness’ emerges as a powerful and critical diagnostic of the epistemic instabilities of our time.",40,4,387,402,Epistemology; Sociology; Power (social and political); Misinformation; Intentionality; Ignorance; Agnotology; Humanity; Denial; Politics,,,,Economic and Social Research Council,http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/104404/ https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0308275X20959432 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0308275X20959432 https://kar.kent.ac.uk/75613/ https://core.ac.uk/download/323054924.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0308275x20959432,,10.1177/0308275x20959432,2984327837,,0,001-994-763-751-014; 004-731-388-298-338; 006-214-424-755-67X; 013-640-725-019-41X; 015-207-494-997-958; 017-408-185-218-838; 017-999-696-704-413; 018-708-401-968-66X; 018-813-232-885-998; 024-166-576-461-071; 024-965-467-297-218; 033-483-596-959-905; 040-124-649-682-938; 040-907-268-218-905; 040-947-935-211-835; 043-528-748-587-522; 045-683-114-023-20X; 047-081-807-403-277; 049-394-434-940-79X; 049-796-645-903-325; 052-197-683-632-056; 052-822-132-694-833; 054-609-436-788-353; 058-324-815-795-242; 059-229-423-082-607; 059-657-910-113-707; 074-779-596-074-576; 077-678-307-717-536; 080-288-504-557-687; 081-628-460-346-590; 085-785-310-763-174; 087-000-219-982-202; 094-355-962-871-628; 104-131-032-463-781; 110-605-388-056-078; 113-149-653-772-618; 117-341-467-392-107; 122-271-179-271-044; 125-143-225-713-484; 128-186-386-081-624; 150-149-506-140-276; 163-757-823-129-186; 164-664-303-513-516; 173-871-803-061-059; 196-477-342-345-241,9

Martin; Sarah E Lamb,"Introduction Falls are the leading cause of accident-related mortality in older adults. Injurious falls are associated with functional decline, disability, healthcare utilisation and significant National Health Service (NHS)-related costs. The evidence base for multifactorial or exercise interventions reducing fractures in the general population is weak. This protocol describes a large-scale UK trial investigating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of alternative falls prevention interventions targeted at community dwelling older adults. Methods and analysis A three-arm, pragmatic, cluster randomised controlled trial, conducted within primary care in England, UK. Sixty-three general practices will be randomised to deliver one of three falls prevention interventions: (1) advice only; (2) advice with exercise; or (3) advice with multifactorial falls prevention (MFFP). We aim to recruit over 9000 community-dwelling adults aged 70 and above. Practices randomised to deliver advice will mail out advice booklets. Practices randomised to deliver ‘active’ interventions, either exercise or MFFP, send all trial participants the advice booklet and a screening survey to identify participants with a history of falling or balance problems. Onward referral to ‘active’ intervention will be based on falls risk determined from balance screen. The primary outcome is peripheral fracture; secondary outcomes include number with at least one fracture, falls, mortality, quality of life and health service resource use at 18 months, captured using self-report and routine healthcare activity data. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has approval from the National Research Ethics Service (REC reference 10/H0401/36; Protocol V.3.1, 21/May/2013). User groups and patient representatives were consulted to inform trial design. Results will be reported at conferences and in peer-reviewed publications. A patient-friendly summary of trial findings will be published on the prevention of falls injury trial (PreFIT) website. This protocol adheres to the recommended SPIRIT Checklist. Amendments will be reported to relevant regulatory parties.

1752,024-741-301-131-75X,Share and protect our health data: an evidence based approach to rare disease patients’ perspectives on data sharing and data protection - quantitative survey and recommendations,2019-07-12,2019,journal article,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,17501172,BioMed Central,United Kingdom,Sandra Courbier; Rebecca Dimond; Virginie Bros-Facer,"The needs and benefits of sharing health data to advance scientific research and improve clinical benefits have been well documented in recent years, specifically in the field of rare diseases where knowledge and expertise are limited and patient populations are geographically dispersed. Understanding what patients want and need from rare disease research and data sharing is important to ensure their participation and engagement in the process, and to ensure that these wishes and needs are embedded within research design. EURORDIS-Rare Diseases Europe regularly surveys the rare disease community to identify its perspectives and needs on a number of issues in order to represent rare disease patients and be their voice within European and International initiatives and policy developments. Here, we present key findings from a large quantitative survey conducted with patients with rare diseases and family members as part of a continuous evidence-based advocacy process developed at EURORDIS. The aim of this survey was to explore patient and family perspectives on data sharing and data protection in research and healthcare settings and develop relevant recommendations to support shaping of future data sharing initiatives in rare disease research. This survey, translated into 23 languages, was carried out via the Rare Barometer Programme and was designed to be accessible to a diverse population with a wide range of education backgrounds. It was widely disseminated via patient organisations worldwide to ensure that a wide range of voices and experiences were represented. Rare disease patients, regardless of the severity of their disease and their socio-demographic profile, are clearly supportive of data sharing to foster research and improve healthcare. However, rare disease patients’ willingness to share their data does come with specific requirements in order to respect their privacy, choices and needs for information regarding the use of their data. To ensure sustainability and success of international data sharing initiatives in health and research for rare diseases, appropriate legislations need to be implemented and multi-stakeholder efforts need to be pursued to foster cultural and technological changes enabling the systematic integration of patients’ preferences regarding sharing of their own health data.",14,1,175,175,Evidence-based practice; Business; Health care; Public trust; Disease; Research design; Rare disease; Data sharing; Public relations; Data Protection Act 1998,"Data protection; Data sharing; Evidence-based approach; Healthcare; Patient engagement; Patient organisation; Public trust; Rare diseases, quantitative survey; Recommendations; Research",Computer Security; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Rare Diseases; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-019-1123-4 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31300010/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13023-019-1123-4 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13023-019-1123-4.pdf https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/123442/ https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/Share_and_protect_our_health_data_an_evidence_based_approach_to_rare_disease_patients_perspectives_on_data_sharing_and_data_protection_-_quantitative_survey_and_recommendations/4575476 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6625078 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31300010 https://core.ac.uk/download/211278622.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13023-019-1123-4,31300010,10.1186/s13023-019-1123-4,2961792602,PMC6625078,0,000-038-370-398-92X; 001-610-630-749-994; 003-711-598-604-01X; 004-918-607-160-620; 005-181-969-308-517; 005-550-008-145-57X; 006-583-886-749-34X; 010-073-292-875-976; 010-455-325-971-336; 019-830-248-607-707; 019-850-338-034-47X; 022-572-297-093-385; 033-071-928-266-953; 039-179-243-657-33X; 040-555-708-244-52X; 047-985-504-801-739; 053-535-813-335-021; 054-778-926-965-153; 059-736-545-320-753; 059-813-227-787-67X; 066-963-182-477-789; 074-658-511-738-281; 091-573-323-843-838; 101-297-804-507-344; 105-785-702-980-104; 109-344-227-686-257; 113-679-689-992-514; 120-794-211-617-421; 122-059-015-538-234; 132-283-605-571-762; 133-833-116-178-089; 145-108-315-252-986; 180-504-774-210-105,24
1753,024-742-629-655-658,Recommendations for the development of Egyptian human biobanking ethical guidelines,2021-01-13,2021,journal article,Wellcome Open Research,2398502x,F1000 Research Ltd,,Ahmed Samir Abdelhafiz; Calvin W. L. Ho; Teck Chuan Voo,"<ns3:p><ns3:bold>Background:</ns3:bold> The development of biobanks is associated with the emergence of new ethical challenges. In Egypt, several biobanks have been established, but there are no specific local ethical guidelines to guide their work. The aim of this study is to develop recommendations for the Egyptian human biobanking ethical guidelines, which take into consideration the specific cultural and legal framework in Egypt.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Methods:</ns3:bold> We searched the literature for available biobanking ethical guidelines. Six themes were the concern of search, namely; informed consent, data protection, return of results, sharing of samples and data, community engagement, and stakeholder engagement. If a document refers to another guideline, the new source is identified and the previous step is repeated.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Results:</ns3:bold> Ten documents were identified, which were analyzed for the themes mentioned above. Guidelines and best practices were identified, and then compared with the published documents about ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) related to biomedical research in Egypt to reach best recommendations.</ns3:p><ns3:p> <ns3:bold>Conclusions:</ns3:bold> We have proposed, by way of recommendations, key characteristics that a national ethics framework in Egypt could have. On informed consent, the practice of broad consent may be harmonized among biobanks in Egypt. Clear policies on return of research results, training requirements and availability of genetic counseling could also be instituted through the national framework. Additionally, such a framework should facilitate community and stakeholders engagement, which is important to secure trust and build consensus on contentious issues arising from sample and data sharing across borders and commercialization, among other concerns.</ns3:p>",6,,4,,,,,,Wellcome Trust,,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16556.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16556.1,,,0,001-274-029-077-285; 006-991-949-353-784; 011-139-667-669-980; 013-921-342-529-704; 025-905-539-042-903; 027-136-287-056-653; 029-255-140-596-81X; 029-736-800-477-718; 031-008-949-513-496; 032-139-212-821-167; 035-205-782-118-061; 037-312-823-596-489; 038-867-733-306-21X; 057-956-911-366-471; 061-852-202-501-106; 064-329-730-588-13X; 065-160-692-055-927; 068-529-936-570-21X; 069-313-316-285-614; 086-341-889-989-736; 091-343-504-987-714; 097-180-068-382-19X; 109-895-401-678-262; 155-135-498-642-296,0

Saccone,"The mu1 opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, has long been a high-priority candidate for human genetic studies of addiction. Because of its potential functional significance, the non-synonymous variant rs1799971 (A118G, Asn40Asp) in OPRM1 has been extensively studied, yet its role in addiction has remained unclear, with conflicting association findings. To resolve the question of what effect, if any, rs1799971 has on substance dependence risk, we conducted collaborative meta-analyses of 25 datasets with over 28,000 European-ancestry subjects. We investigated non-specific risk for ""general"" substance dependence, comparing cases dependent on any substance to controls who were non-dependent on all assessed substances. We also examined five specific substance dependence diagnoses: DSM-IV alcohol, opioid, cannabis, and cocaine dependence, and nicotine dependence defined by the proxy of heavy/light smoking (cigarettes-per-day >20 vs. ≤ 10). The G allele showed a modest protective effect on general substance dependence (OR = 0.90, 95% C.I. [0.83-0.97], p value = 0.0095, N = 16,908). We observed similar effects for each individual substance, although these were not statistically significant, likely because of reduced sample sizes. We conclude that rs1799971 contributes to mechanisms of addiction liability that are shared across different addictive substances. This project highlights the benefits of examining addictive behaviors collectively and the power of collaborative data sharing and meta-analyses.",46,2,151,169,Psychiatry; Case-control study; Cannabis;

Krumholz,"It is uncertain whether the replication of systematic reviews, particularly those with the same objectives and resources, would employ similar methods and/or arrive at identical findings. We compared the results and conclusions of two concurrent systematic reviews undertaken by two independent research teams provided with the same objectives, resources, and individual participant-level data. Two centers in the USA and UK were each provided with participant-level data on 17 multi-site clinical trials of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). The teams were blinded to each other’s methods and findings until after publication. We conducted a retrospective structured comparison of the results of the two systematic reviews. The main outcome measures included (1) trial inclusion criteria; (2) statistical methods; (3) summary efficacy and risk estimates; and (4) conclusions. The two research teams’ meta-analyses inclusion criteria were broadly similar but differed slightly in trial inclusion and research methodology. They obtained similar results in summary estimates of most clinical outcomes and adverse events. Center A incorporated all trials into summary estimates of efficacy and harms, while Center B concentrated on analyses stratified by surgical approach. Center A found a statistically significant, but small, benefit whereas Center B reported no advantage. In the analysis of harms, neither showed an increased cancer risk at 48 months, although Center B reported a significant increase at 24 months. Conclusions reflected these differences in summary estimates of benefit balanced with small but potentially important risk of harm. Two independent groups given the same research objectives, data, resources, funding, and time produced broad general agreement but differed in several areas. These differences, the importance of which is debatable, indicate the value of the availability of data to allow for more than a single approach and a single interpretation of the data.

This paper examines the ethical principles that should guide regulatory processes regarding consent and data sharing in this context. We argue that a genomic dataset administered by the health system carries substantial societal benefits, and that the collective nature of this initiative means that at least those patients who benefit from genome sequencing have an ethical obligation to share their health information. This obligation is grounded in considerations of fairness. Furthermore, we argue that the use of genomic data for the advancement of medical knowledge should be permitted without explicit consent and that international and other bodies should be granted access to these data, provided certain conditions are satisfied.",28,2,147,154,Business; Exome sequencing; Obligation; Data sharing; Context (language use); Health information; Medical knowledge; Genomic medicine; Engineering ethics; Scale (social sciences),,Codes of Ethics; Genetic Privacy/ethics; Genetic Services/ethics; Humans,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (Wellcome) (203132/Z/16/Z) International; Wellcome Trust (096527) United Kingdom,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-019-0507-1.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6974588 https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/1039335 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-019-0507-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41431-019-0507-1,31534213,10.1038/s41431-019-0507-1,2973469696,PMC6974588,0,001-508-468-325-630; 005-154-022-562-359; 005-969-320-324-014; 006-252-946-689-03X; 007-095-294-592-450; 010-082-886-718-163; 010-938-187-997-242; 012-831-060-967-049; 014-991-165-929-976; 016-555-073-400-460; 024-768-036-874-551; 025-124-511-732-169; 027-516-970-682-899; 027-769-288-574-428; 027-794-781-078-22X; 033-124-652-049-160; 036-855-305-545-432; 039-545-900-774-42X; 043-105-960-054-593; 044-927-387-913-082; 051-374-516-482-474; 052-052-191-934-763; 054-776-120-688-370; 062-355-884-960-21X; 065-958-273-215-976; 068-968-384-496-65X; 072-204-769-201-685; 074-472-376-687-964; 075-318-041-742-483; 076-412-458-167-290; 081-123-625-989-292; 081-468-175-152-762; 093-907-724-436-643; 097-398-756-468-909; 100-075-275-452-105; 104-446-044-530-159; 111-820-332-679-573; 113-246-601-846-384; 121-985-126-692-740; 129-155-162-159-191; 139-913-281-332-850; 154-979-930-424-460; 176-387-237-964-871; 176-641-984-522-349,16

However, these successes necessitate that we understand more about the pathways of ageing to plan and cost our health and social care services, to support our ageing population to live healthier for longer and to make adequate provisions for retirement. Longitudinal studies of ageing facilitate such understanding in many countries around the world. Scotland presently does not have a longitudinal study of ageing, despite dramatic increases to its ageing population and its poor health record. Healthy AGeing in Scotland (HAGIS) constitutes the launch of Scotland’s first comprehensive longitudinal study of ageing. Methods A sample of 1000 people aged 50+ years will be invited to take part in a household social survey. The innovative sampling procedure used administrative data to identify eligible households. Anonymised survey responses will be linked to administrative data. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was obtained from the host institution for the study design and from the Public Benefits and Privacy Panel for administrative data linkage. Anonymised survey data will be deposited with the UK Data Service. A subset of survey data, harmonised with other global ageing studies, will be available via the Gateway to Global Aging platform. These data will enable powerful cross-country comparisons across the social, economic and health domains that will be relevant for national and international research.

Felstead; Melanie J. Leng; Sarah E. Metcalfe; Silvia Gonzalez,"In this paper we present surface water oxygen (δ18O), hydrogen (δD) and inorganic carbon (δ13CDIC) isotope data to gain a better understanding of the modern day hydrogeology of Cuatrocienegas Basin, a semi-arid region in northeastern Mexico. Our study focuses on 26 water samples collected in March 2008 to investigate: 1) current provenance and flow pathways of surface waters, 2) the use of stable isotopes in identifying water loss and environmental degradation, and 3) human influence on hydrogeology. δ18O for Cuatrocienegas water samples ranged from −7.99 to +4.97‰ (mean −5.23 ± 3.13‰), δD from −54.8 to +0.3‰ (mean −42.4 ± 14.4‰), and δ13CTDIC from −21.6 to −9.2‰ (mean −14.3 ± 3.4‰). Samples collected progressively away from their respective spring lines display increasing δ18O and δD values. Isotope data suggest that where the residence time of the groundwater is long and/or the system is hydrologically open, δ18O may not be a reliable indicator of water loss and environmental degradation. Our data suggest the central cienega (area W(b)) is the most viable area for palaeoenvironmental study and long term monitoring is an essential tool in the identification of ecosystem damage and response, allowing for better future management of the complex and fragile CCB ecosystem.",121,,15,23,Structural basin; Geology; Total inorganic carbon; Stable isotope ratio; Provenance; Ciénega; Hydrology; δ18O; Groundwater; Surface water,,,,NERC,https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa21956/Download/0021956-04062015130319.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/33452743 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140196315001196 https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa21956 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015JArEn.121...15F/abstract https://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/3136/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42478430.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2015.05.009,,10.1016/j.jaridenv.2015.05.009,1849777045,,0,000-316-382-812-013; 001-873-223-756-729; 008-124-034-146-629; 011-553-532-667-826; 014-268-595-974-619; 016-158-756-325-325; 018-872-736-969-706; 023-859-442-233-407; 024-620-855-313-933; 026-211-147-387-267; 026-905-137-518-805; 028-365-309-289-358; 028-618-407-261-167; 034-955-367-050-414; 044-778-331-695-091; 045-250-582-081-597; 053-532-086-173-308; 053-816-956-948-088; 060-846-979-548-117; 061-440-137-208-753; 061-659-437-693-224; 073-775-487-558-083; 076-997-363-018-010; 077-803-875-170-268; 078-070-677-482-069; 085-324-057-887-306; 099-760-362-704-181; 102-166-826-261-177; 108-036-476-619-548; 112-392-048-767-697; 115-894-477-139-786; 118-549-035-632-954; 120-231-850-511-907; 134-279-326-290-862; 136-885-145-023-792; 137-036-718-395-834; 143-624-360-048-130; 151-950-427-418-065; 158-061-321-843-826; 162-130-929-992-126; 167-904-335-647-083; 181-106-857-122-082; 188-133-408-360-032,3
1802,025-412-781-234-270,Deconstruct: A scalable method of as-built heat power loss coefficient inference for UK dwellings using smart meter data,,2019,journal article,Energy and Buildings,3787788,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Jonathan Chambers; Tadj Oreszczyn,"Abstract Dwellings in the UK account for about 25% of global energy demand, of which 60% is space heating making this a key area for efficiency improvement. Dwelling UK Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) are currently based on surveyed data, rather than energy use monitoring. The installation of smart meters provides an opportunity to develop an EPC based on in situ dwelling thermal performance. This paper presents ‘Deconstruct’ – a method of estimating the as-built Heat Power Loss Coefficient (HPLC) of occupied dwellings as a measure of thermal performance, using just smart-meter and meteorological data. Deconstruct is a steady-state grey box building model combined with a data processing pipeline and a model fitting method that limits the effects of confounding factors. Smart meter data from 780 UK dwellings from the UK Energy Demand Research Project (EDRP), was used to calculate a median HPLC of 0.28 kW/°C (±15%). The stability of the estimate across multiple years of data with different weather and energy use was demonstrated. Deconstruct was found to be suitable for large scale inference of dwelling thermal properties using the UK's new smart metering data infrastructure.",183,,443,453,Data processing; Pipeline (computing); Energy (signal processing); Reliability engineering; Building model; Smart meter; Measure (data warehouse); Metering mode; Environmental science; Scalability,,,,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); EDF Energy R&D UK Centre; RCUK Centre for Energy Epidemiology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778818314324 https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:128934 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10065481/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.11.016,,10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.11.016,2901341802,,0,007-163-504-943-653; 011-145-492-147-849; 011-240-082-549-656; 012-189-802-751-883; 012-193-200-500-114; 015-797-762-493-75X; 016-483-477-676-72X; 025-245-863-323-810; 026-257-326-944-640; 030-061-356-943-497; 058-787-226-530-538; 061-810-858-324-661; 070-578-037-691-248; 072-876-527-173-329; 077-915-566-968-934; 079-306-076-318-655; 084-969-841-366-354; 091-589-081-644-727; 098-249-723-967-231; 098-517-227-276-325; 102-939-328-500-106; 109-968-098-720-919; 110-366-768-403-873; 116-134-623-170-832; 116-966-153-840-433; 118-001-540-492-450; 123-615-223-030-786; 143-602-594-768-766; 146-229-478-760-026; 150-576-414-125-438; 154-445-085-795-54X; 156-102-931-730-63X; 178-699-576-239-426; 189-736-438-087-099; 198-884-454-244-219; 199-493-167-228-011,13

These challenges will make it more difficult to guarantee anonymity for participants, provide information to satisfy the requirements of informed consent, and ensure complete withdrawal from research when requested. To move forward, we need to improve the current governance systems for research so that they are responsive to individual privacy concerns but can also be effective at a global level. We need to develop a system of e-governance that can complement existing governance systems but that places greater reliance on the use of technology to ensure compliance with ethical and legal requirements. These new governance structures must be able to address the concerns of research participants while at the same time ensuring effective data sharing that promotes public trust in genomics research.",13,1,415,431,Environmental resource management; Internet privacy; Biobank; Business; Anonymity; E-governance; Public trust; Research participant; Data sharing; Corporate governance; Informed consent,,"Ethical Review; Ethics Committees; Genetic Privacy/ethics; Genome, Human; Genomics/ethics; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Informed Consent/ethics; International Cooperation; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Tissue Banks/ethics",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (096599) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (096599/2/11/Z) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22404490 https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-082410-101454 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1222668-the-tension-between-data-sharing-and-the-protection-of-privacy-in-genomics-research https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22404490/ https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-017-9573-9_8 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9573-9_8/fulltext.html http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4337968 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-94-017-9573-9_8.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-94-017-9573-9_8 https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-genom-082410-101454 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/316229 https://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-genom-082410-101454,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-genom-082410-101454,22404490,10.1146/annurev-genom-082410-101454,2156908711,PMC4337968,0,002-873-513-489-709; 004-119-780-527-149; 004-515-295-771-10X; 005-277-835-128-875; 010-739-613-653-53X; 011-076-534-151-883; 011-370-297-227-473; 013-811-231-732-980; 016-513-542-264-372; 016-620-192-929-648; 017-332-092-657-286; 019-538-368-158-59X; 020-013-516-594-400; 020-829-471-605-584; 021-916-672-952-445; 022-056-564-730-094; 022-068-226-888-890; 022-503-171-463-468; 024-328-573-368-807; 024-683-146-359-849; 026-166-680-227-173; 027-516-970-682-899; 029-222-023-047-36X; 033-960-905-340-68X; 034-226-623-297-644; 035-382-619-560-551; 035-907-809-873-267; 038-368-681-174-289; 038-845-020-126-924; 039-545-900-774-42X; 040-759-446-719-269; 042-461-015-490-766; 044-927-387-913-082; 046-320-213-358-332; 046-737-153-006-944; 046-931-988-722-980; 048-094-336-079-579; 049-054-167-131-769; 050-803-952-209-905; 050-969-179-014-018; 064-013-487-083-383; 064-271-570-127-65X; 064-452-917-942-825; 065-958-273-215-976; 068-223-037-824-456; 069-241-057-491-906; 071-827-673-101-799; 079-463-860-459-709; 079-467-713-899-040; 080-596-755-380-606; 082-565-929-914-120; 085-295-269-978-648; 085-532-877-973-273; 085-609-549-539-526; 089-341-965-303-716; 091-521-558-928-348; 091-938-818-449-524; 094-369-784-380-689; 097-585-942-894-155; 102-769-375-951-920; 111-340-179-135-787; 113-605-499-839-824; 114-655-952-464-285; 122-998-493-036-98X; 127-896-632-666-581; 133-040-069-009-37X; 137-695-449-324-702; 143-867-261-494-81X; 146-256-280-413-591; 155-902-760-527-758; 162-811-298-374-543; 165-817-868-647-600; 168-355-737-867-836; 175-795-156-166-567; 186-670-491-897-885; 188-270-297-190-317,180

Clarke; Heather Payne; Jan van der Meulen,"The public reporting of patient outcomes is crucial for quality improvement and informing patient choice. However, outcome reporting in radiotherapy, despite being a major component of cancer control, is extremely sparse globally. Public reporting has many challenges, including difficulties in defining meaningful measures of treatment quality, limitations in data infrastructure, and fragmented health insurance schemes. The National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA), done in the England and Wales National Health Service (NHS), shows that it is feasible to develop outcome indicators for radiotherapy treatment, including patient-reported outcomes. The NPCA provides a transparent mechanism for comparing the performance of all NHS providers, with results accessible to patients, providers, and policy makers. Using the NPCA as a case study, we discuss the development of a radiotherapy-outcomes reporting programme, its impact and future potential, and the challenges and opportunities to develop this approach across other tumour types and in different health systems.",22,5,e207,e215,Audit; Patient choice; MEDLINE; Prostate cancer; National health service; Radiation oncology; Public reporting; Family medicine; Quality management; Medicine,,Health Care Sector; Humans; Male; Medical Audit; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Prostatic Neoplasms/radiotherapy; Quality Improvement; Radiation Oncology; State Medicine,,Department of Health (DRF-2018-11-ST2-036) United Kingdom,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204520305581 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(20)30558-1/fulltext https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33676600/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33676600 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33676600,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1470-2045(20)30558-1,33676600,10.1016/s1470-2045(20)30558-1,3135280758,,0,001-976-296-979-036; 003-256-621-365-757; 004-047-007-851-072; 005-102-726-111-877; 005-121-304-625-222; 006-504-273-161-465; 007-775-197-562-267; 008-253-962-573-51X; 009-046-236-640-647; 009-183-839-721-172; 011-599-035-528-204; 014-264-430-846-530; 016-526-996-387-142; 019-638-536-415-080; 022-029-380-047-879; 022-548-107-319-567; 022-774-871-304-526; 024-264-471-210-38X; 025-297-837-084-304; 028-541-547-810-495; 029-874-399-651-462; 030-374-694-807-33X; 032-089-026-071-603; 032-636-866-864-50X; 033-230-206-088-345; 034-456-524-235-425; 035-226-481-979-880; 037-702-422-626-257; 038-006-923-940-866; 038-991-782-138-708; 040-775-428-457-146; 041-846-676-194-105; 042-279-251-387-081; 045-090-437-886-17X; 045-656-359-286-08X; 045-862-492-441-592; 047-173-315-956-551; 048-673-779-302-57X; 048-805-245-433-884; 049-043-450-653-454; 056-377-592-074-160; 060-724-411-743-213; 068-089-352-223-023; 071-969-170-490-925; 072-062-345-824-036; 074-027-534-456-307; 079-263-509-740-695; 080-076-650-600-650; 080-451-144-751-925; 080-487-704-901-229; 081-183-590-209-691; 082-846-010-073-937; 084-558-720-080-900; 086-583-767-135-662; 087-037-045-837-871; 087-079-580-391-379; 087-721-929-191-51X; 088-304-820-792-353; 092-358-013-557-902; 096-569-707-660-563; 097-105-863-127-075; 098-867-139-223-784; 102-105-982-550-641; 107-820-543-589-442; 114-419-607-198-399; 126-839-159-207-285; 129-774-964-861-479; 132-446-847-112-490; 138-503-932-038-033; 139-647-562-920-545; 143-160-368-702-296,2

Volberda; Saeed Khanagha; Charles Baden-Fuller; Oli R. Mihalache; Julian Birkinshaw,"As digital technologies such as cloud and edge computing, machine learning, advanced artificial intelligence (AI), and the internet of things (IoT) unfold, traditional industries such as telecoms, media, entertainment, and financial services are being reconfigured and new sectors are emerging. In this new competitive landscape we observe new organizational forms and new business models, including the emergence of platforms and multi-sided markets. This emergence has required a strategic response from incumbent firms, including both well-established firms and some first-generation digital enterprises. With these advances in digital technology, the very nature of strategy is changing. Fundamentally, the use of digital technologies may provide new opportunities for efficiency gains, customer intimacy, and innovation. However, without the right mindset for change, appropriate digital routines, and structural changes, digital transformation efforts will fail. We therefore present a framework for strategizing in this new digital competitive landscape that underscores the importance of the interplay between (1) the cognitive barriers faced by managers when trying to understand this new digital world and envision new digital business models, (2) a need to reconfigure and extend digital routines, and (3) new organizational forms that are better equipped to creating value and gaining competitive advantage. From this framework of essential pillars, we derive four journeys of digital transformation for companies that were formed in the pre-digital economy. We also describe the management roles required by top, middle, and frontline managers, depending on whether the digital migration is evolutionary or transformative and whether the firm is responding to or attempting to shape the ecosystem. Although digital transformation is technically all about technology, the more important issue is how companies make their way through this strange new digital world in which they find themselves. Ultimately digital transformation is as much about strategizing as it is about technology.",54,5,102110,,Digital transformation; Financial services; Business; Edge computing; Mindset; Business model; Knowledge management; Competitive advantage; Transformative learning; Cloud computing,,,,University of Pennsylvania; RCUK; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Research Councils UK,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/26660/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024630121000418 https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/strategizing-in-a-digital-world-overcoming-cognitive-barriers-rec,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lrp.2021.102110,,10.1016/j.lrp.2021.102110,3162743317,,0,000-432-937-724-374; 002-926-393-487-448; 003-458-604-892-921; 005-471-849-703-905; 006-034-909-004-366; 006-828-891-987-695; 007-030-418-502-131; 007-597-611-796-597; 007-677-839-948-112; 010-587-275-228-214; 010-652-623-285-871; 010-865-020-768-400; 011-526-846-145-963; 012-063-759-527-46X; 012-128-137-288-200; 013-072-218-541-964; 013-693-711-125-077; 014-019-405-348-645; 017-191-168-410-33X; 020-463-008-590-495; 021-419-183-008-085; 022-043-662-972-393; 022-737-016-220-927; 023-201-366-826-065; 025-402-274-938-418; 025-949-256-411-902; 028-238-490-324-434; 028-850-287-589-227; 030-424-393-136-862; 031-446-952-817-490; 032-209-994-388-062; 032-764-567-189-424; 033-998-338-419-159; 034-172-406-706-455; 035-037-369-776-335; 035-397-162-424-040; 036-165-258-727-832; 037-191-139-145-448; 037-474-639-894-218; 037-560-399-558-733; 038-445-489-540-644; 038-482-611-139-006; 038-803-837-750-320; 038-819-593-196-197; 043-394-303-594-585; 044-509-908-667-592; 045-739-388-765-841; 046-765-964-472-509; 048-058-210-428-851; 048-835-874-232-863; 049-254-341-082-189; 049-416-772-163-609; 049-765-994-946-76X; 050-405-450-488-904; 053-295-670-541-193; 053-933-440-458-021; 056-342-442-025-048; 058-122-081-158-184; 059-151-286-355-308; 059-811-403-653-058; 061-206-598-746-209; 061-744-897-091-554; 062-013-064-709-177; 062-724-919-249-059; 065-995-783-171-97X; 066-303-750-449-732; 066-451-358-691-123; 066-898-504-855-263; 067-783-704-470-604; 070-115-232-763-787; 071-034-567-092-390; 072-285-224-277-185; 072-329-724-190-360; 073-573-716-543-999; 074-074-071-012-84X; 075-795-462-319-650; 077-293-914-533-90X; 078-258-348-874-760; 080-184-643-032-884; 080-890-676-959-086; 081-268-341-303-639; 085-657-106-088-742; 088-590-223-947-53X; 092-029-377-856-244; 094-222-697-721-442; 094-330-845-131-697; 099-490-005-105-116; 101-360-246-008-266; 102-525-116-738-681; 113-336-574-216-027; 115-349-062-797-767; 115-671-100-075-534; 118-795-321-245-318; 119-543-190-914-248; 120-957-057-309-300; 122-186-800-394-821; 124-084-285-631-831; 125-212-750-683-224; 128-695-455-315-734; 130-117-216-933-452; 130-370-370-320-207; 130-741-566-088-497; 131-316-791-060-844; 135-779-293-209-526; 137-687-347-877-541; 138-822-904-205-699; 142-974-682-273-262; 143-157-376-868-109; 144-867-349-933-449; 145-025-237-778-830; 150-445-115-600-040; 156-861-588-624-430; 158-237-026-933-753; 161-890-935-565-986; 163-506-395-697-729; 164-225-841-088-815; 165-869-945-671-298; 173-210-352-427-008; 174-629-709-250-25X; 181-514-810-000-654; 182-299-735-001-653; 183-981-103-973-073; 185-492-912-762-888; 187-368-672-372-382; 194-730-934-613-573; 195-108-940-590-968; 198-733-675-854-389,6

The integration of urban infrastructures with information and communication technologies enables the development of new operations models. Digitised infrastructures offer opportunities for public and private organisations to design and deliver more customer-centric products or services, particularly for those that require geographical proximity with consumers in the online to offline (O2O) context. A framework is developed and used to analyse three case examples. These cases illustrate the emergence of new operations models and, demonstrate how smart cities are redefining the characteristics of operations models around their scalability, analytical output and connectivity. We also explore the feasibility, vulnerability and acceptability of each new operation. This paper contributes to our understanding of how smart cities can potentially transform operational models, and sets out a research agenda for operations management...",27,6,514,528,Digital economy; Operations management; Smart city; Context (language use); Computer science; Scalability; Information and Communications Technology; Big data; Vulnerability (computing),,,,Research Councils UK,https://core.ac.uk/display/46564233 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09537287.2016.1147096 https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/13879/ https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/101277/ https://core.ac.uk/download/42630117.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537287.2016.1147096,,10.1080/09537287.2016.1147096,2284774080,,0,001-192-777-970-918; 003-153-241-825-190; 004-572-032-651-385; 004-579-736-325-985; 006-345-184-705-250; 006-989-599-318-694; 008-086-855-035-534; 008-568-541-949-263; 008-936-401-996-515; 011-962-065-866-267; 012-661-520-036-562; 013-330-225-538-914; 013-706-696-180-253; 013-833-616-922-686; 015-737-038-893-598; 016-452-427-313-005; 016-913-601-591-596; 017-937-488-383-754; 018-651-078-247-824; 019-250-289-805-602; 021-920-311-828-213; 022-774-738-500-720; 023-327-726-866-129; 024-223-844-410-835; 028-038-085-939-05X; 028-254-115-363-028; 030-768-446-029-913; 032-237-266-139-779; 033-417-062-525-840; 034-875-583-087-393; 036-165-258-727-832; 037-638-986-689-241; 040-451-289-861-18X; 040-750-473-708-740; 040-949-705-074-037; 041-403-831-134-274; 042-252-942-947-631; 044-558-681-952-727; 047-709-327-277-196; 050-248-007-674-845; 051-067-423-600-38X; 051-601-133-228-097; 055-498-815-134-39X; 057-392-177-941-038; 059-108-770-417-124; 059-278-014-990-138; 063-497-319-615-528; 064-380-896-385-184; 066-119-430-984-891; 073-940-192-507-322; 079-369-231-022-570; 080-135-214-985-096; 081-453-758-141-801; 084-832-715-321-49X; 085-064-861-939-316; 090-636-221-923-414; 090-779-388-426-741; 091-041-663-224-85X; 092-609-497-400-592; 099-425-557-614-356; 102-169-007-053-650; 104-889-475-186-487; 110-194-529-883-007; 121-066-927-168-853; 123-791-669-288-661; 130-741-566-088-497; 134-172-243-601-282; 134-869-123-030-323; 139-267-933-458-552; 140-327-338-155-976; 141-340-581-523-727; 142-623-699-336-106; 146-334-558-376-387; 147-961-620-569-825; 151-249-497-623-931; 153-741-318-378-043; 157-549-913-521-284; 160-366-610-076-941; 162-973-743-220-449; 164-929-629-152-002; 175-785-932-198-352; 182-581-682-175-826; 193-362-332-795-16X,59

A wide variety of industry sectors, including manufacturing, utilities, agriculture, transportation, and healthcare are actively seeking to incorporate IoT technologies in their operations. The increased connectivity and data sharing that give IoT systems their advantages also increase their vulnerability to attack. In this study, the authors explore the automated generation of attacks using genetic programming (GP), so that defences can be tested objectively in advance of deployment. In the authors' system, the GP-generated attackers targeted publish-subscribe communications within a wireless sensor networks that was protected by an artificial immune intrusion detection system (IDS) taken from the literature. The GP attackers successfully suppressed more legitimate messages than the hand-coded attack used originally to test the IDS, whilst reducing the likelihood of detection. Based on the results, it was possible to reconfigure the IDS to improve its performance. Whilst the experiments were focussed on establishing a proof-of-principle rather than a turnkey solution, they indicate that GP-generated attackers have the potential to improve the protection of systems with large attack surfaces, in a way that is complementary to traditional testing and certification.",7,4,113,122,Software deployment; Genetic programming; Wireless sensor network; Turnkey; Data sharing; Computer network; Intrusion detection system; Computer security; Computer science; Key distribution in wireless sensor networks; Vulnerability (computing),,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1566785/ https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-wss.2016.0090 https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1049/iet-wss.2016.0090 https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-wss.2016.0090 https://core.ac.uk/display/111025947 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7979715/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/iet-wss/iet-wss7.html#MrugalaTH17 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7979715/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/111025947.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1049/iet-wss.2016.0090,,10.1049/iet-wss.2016.0090,2605369382,,0,001-916-277-343-935; 004-844-841-828-896; 005-031-442-243-266; 008-455-894-353-376; 010-259-105-557-784; 012-284-341-403-258; 015-392-377-425-78X; 018-814-147-267-436; 020-059-157-930-196; 026-064-684-055-332; 034-923-664-337-44X; 035-801-513-794-740; 038-942-747-823-354; 040-329-501-948-663; 041-627-162-551-339; 042-557-871-302-525; 046-198-060-514-544; 049-774-912-541-342; 056-855-574-759-207; 058-865-955-951-181; 065-090-805-073-38X; 083-170-968-515-851; 086-826-641-538-46X; 089-206-497-571-047; 090-577-426-431-686; 137-616-902-479-676; 144-796-391-638-165; 149-284-805-235-714,14

In broad terms, the challenge is simple; how to ensure the (public) benefits of data, such as improvements in service delivery or individual and collective well-being, while avoiding harms such as discrimination, injustice or placing undue burdens on individuals and groups. The difficulty, as ever, lies in the details. As Nicol et al 1 observe, informed consent is important but does not replace the need for an appropriate governance framework that covers the wider ecosystem of data generation, use and reuse. Moreover, there is no one universal oversight mechanism for data sharing, but what counts as ‘appropriate’ must take into account the context and purpose of data use. In this regard, the study by Ford et al is an important and valuable contribution to our understanding of the …",46,6,380,381,Internet privacy; Business; Reuse; Injustice; Data sharing; Context (language use); Corporate governance; Test data generation; Informed consent; Service delivery framework,ethics; regulation; social control of science/technology,"Electronic Health Records; Ethics Committees, Research; Humans; Informed Consent; United Kingdom",,Leverhulme Trust,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32457204 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32457204/ https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/25/medethics-2020-106189 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/1110076 https://jme.bmj.com/content/46/6/380 https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/46/6/380.full.pdf http://europepmc.org/article/MED/32457204,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106189,32457204,10.1136/medethics-2020-106189,3031442004,,0,000-574-644-855-905; 004-297-420-977-295; 017-521-036-118-555; 042-078-829-172-933; 072-672-047-463-533; 073-267-268-269-90X; 086-741-582-597-87X,2

From the start, strong isolation between cloud tenants was seen to be of paramount importance, provided first by virtual machines (VM) and later by containers, which share the operating system (OS) kernel. Increasingly it is the case that applications also require facilities to effect isolation and protection of data managed by those applications. They also require flexible data sharing with other applications, often across the traditional cloud-isolation boundaries; for example, when government, consisting of different departments, provides services to its citizens through a common platform. These concerns relate to the management of data. Traditional access control is application and principal/role specific, applied at policy enforcement points, after which there is no subsequent control over where data flows;a crucial issue once data has left its owner’s control by cloud-hosted applications andwithin cloud-services. Information Flow Control (IFC), in addition, offers system-wide, end-to-end, flow control based on the properties of the data. We discuss the potential of cloud-deployed IFC for enforcing owners’ data flow policy with regard to protection and sharing, aswell as safeguarding against malicious or buggy software. In addition, the audit log associated with IFC provides transparency and offers system-wide visibility over data flows. This helps those responsible to meet their data management obligations, providing evidence of compliance, and aids in the identification ofpolicy errors and misconfigurations. We present our IFC model and describe and evaluate our IFC architecture and implementation (CamFlow). This comprises an OS level implementation of IFC with support for application management, together with an IFC-enabled middleware.",5,3,472,484,Data management; Software as a service; Data sharing; Application lifecycle management; Computer security; Computer science; Data flow diagram; Access control; Cloud computing; Audit trail; Software as a service; Virtual machine; Software; Data sharing; Computer security; Computer science; Access control; Cloud computing; Audit trail; Dataflow,,,,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1506.html#PasquierSEB15 https://www.growkudos.com/publications/10.1109%252Ftcc.2015.2489211/reader https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/camflow-managed-data-sharing-for-cloud-services https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7295590/ https://scholar.harvard.edu/tfjmp/publications/camflow-managed-data-sharing-cloud-services https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04391 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7295590/ https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04391.pdf https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/36638437,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tcc.2015.2489211,,10.1109/tcc.2015.2489211,3098099450; 2237023204,,2,000-484-914-776-82X; 001-997-195-655-123; 002-977-011-497-158; 008-831-930-592-013; 014-579-699-422-286; 017-957-960-149-83X; 019-901-526-966-976; 020-125-821-525-811; 021-079-189-918-006; 022-739-236-040-855; 023-245-050-566-53X; 023-383-249-408-518; 025-468-687-527-133; 026-176-264-928-957; 029-977-786-520-165; 032-439-203-232-111; 033-208-261-221-101; 036-948-043-667-845; 042-148-832-899-253; 043-599-503-604-468; 046-462-633-335-106; 048-919-240-276-598; 050-342-052-047-075; 050-966-542-841-429; 053-983-726-692-492; 054-601-712-080-137; 056-638-002-309-402; 058-685-052-587-341; 058-783-552-827-291; 061-744-065-440-686; 062-404-589-984-647; 063-665-321-874-174; 066-257-794-875-237; 069-264-239-475-677; 070-329-102-828-136; 075-277-448-842-015; 076-738-007-543-330; 077-886-772-688-87X; 077-922-671-109-643; 083-585-988-954-274; 093-109-478-734-656; 102-185-421-933-864; 106-468-476-972-778; 106-660-804-334-91X; 109-503-174-896-853; 110-887-495-775-367; 111-683-515-386-468; 112-963-946-809-12X; 116-883-444-428-402; 120-218-029-596-69X; 121-837-730-172-00X; 124-435-003-190-022; 125-526-310-323-008; 127-536-128-596-378; 132-873-561-308-574; 133-052-869-381-725; 141-528-605-166-74X; 149-584-187-717-031; 178-374-436-553-442,45

Giordano; Tue H. Hansen; Lenka Groeneveld; Michelle Hudson; Ewan R. Pearson; Hartmut Ruetten; Jane Kaye,"The purpose of this study was to explore and compare different countries in what motivated research participants’ decisions whether to share their de-identified data. We investigated European DIRECT (Diabetes Research on Patient Stratification) research project participants’ desire for control over sharing different types of their de-identified data, and with who data could be shared in the future after the project ends. A cross-sectional survey was disseminated among DIRECT project participants. The results found that there was a significant association between country and attitudes towards advancing research, protecting privacy, and beliefs about risks and benefits to sharing data. When given the choice to have control, some participants (<50% overall) indicated that having control over what data is shared and with whom was important; and control over what data types are shared was less important than respondents deciding who data are shared with. Danish respondents indicated higher odds of desire to control data types shared, and Dutch respondents showed higher odds of desire to control who data will be shared with. Overall, what research participants expect in terms of control over data sharing needs to be considered and aligned with sharing for future research and re-use of data. Our findings show that even with de-identified data, respondents prioritise privacy above all else. This study argues to move research participants from passive participation in biomedical research to considering their opinions about data sharing and control of de-identified biomedical data.",27,5,721,729,Medical research; Association (psychology); Odds; Psychology; Danish; Control (management); Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Multivariate analysis; Applied psychology,,Europe; Female; Humans; Information Dissemination; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Multivariate Analysis; Privacy; Research Subjects; Risk Assessment,,Medical Research Council (MR/K005707/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/N00633X/1) United Kingdom,https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/motivations-for-data-sharingviews-of-research-participants-from-f https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:5710e13 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30700834 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6461907 https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/motivations-for-data-sharingviews-of-research-participants-from-f https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.atira.dk%3Apublications%2F90164d5e-1125-4853-93bf-af17677086dd https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-019-0344-2.pdf http://www-nature-com-443.webvpn.bjmu.tsg211.com/articles/s41431-019-0344-2 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-019-0344-2 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1370265-motivations-for-data-sharing-views-of-research-participants-from-four-european-countries--a-direct-study https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6461907 https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/7f2fe5d6-764c-4323-8158-463d1f9e588b https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/ws/files/31077402/Author_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/motivations-for-data-sharing-views-of-research-participants-from- https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/967829 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30700834/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41431-019-0344-2,30700834,10.1038/s41431-019-0344-2,2913451912,PMC6461907,0,000-158-910-068-398; 000-541-435-302-414; 001-590-222-771-062; 003-361-281-809-829; 004-613-862-207-388; 004-658-191-615-397; 006-939-330-635-835; 007-406-314-592-593; 007-463-981-208-138; 016-743-775-117-289; 023-216-452-628-403; 041-166-847-536-597; 043-524-986-675-036; 043-786-976-783-463; 047-632-315-687-283; 049-989-488-206-788; 053-899-046-769-255; 054-778-926-965-153; 059-137-040-628-678; 071-827-673-101-799; 083-680-673-103-083; 103-930-969-143-394; 114-655-952-464-285; 114-658-000-212-025; 123-219-259-676-525; 159-485-857-843-520,13

We sought to delineate the molecular and phenotypic spectrum of a novel neurodevelopmental disorder caused by variants in the GNAI1 gene. Through large cohort trio-based exome sequencing and international data-sharing, we identified 24 unrelated individuals with NDD phenotypes and a variant in GNAI1, which encodes the inhibitory Gαi1 subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins. We collected detailed genotype and phenotype information for each affected individual. We identified 16 unique variants in GNAI1 in 24 affected individuals; 23 occurred de novo and 1 was inherited from a mosaic parent. Most affected individuals have a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Core features include global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, and epilepsy. This collaboration establishes GNAI1 variants as a cause of NDDs. GNAI1-related NDD is most often characterized by severe to profound delays, hypotonia, epilepsy that ranges from self-limiting to intractable, behavior problems, and variable mild dysmorphic features.",23,5,881,887,Exome sequencing; Autism; Epilepsy; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Hypotonia; Global developmental delay; Genetics; Intellectual disability; Genetic heterogeneity; Biology,,Child; Developmental Disabilities/genetics; Humans; Intellectual Disability/diagnosis; Muscle Hypotonia/diagnosis; Neurodevelopmental Disorders/diagnosis; Seizures/genetics; Whole Exome Sequencing,,NHGRI NIH HHS (UM1 HG008900) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (R01 NS069605) United States; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NHGRI NIH HHS (R01 HG009141) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8107131 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473207/ https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-020-01076-8.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33473207 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41436-020-01076-8 https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/variants-in-gnai1-cause-a-syndrome-associated-with-variable-featu https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/272921,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41436-020-01076-8,33473207,10.1038/s41436-020-01076-8,3123712009,PMC8107131,0,003-462-617-298-27X; 008-263-024-747-850; 009-995-008-408-883; 010-788-026-154-796; 015-307-411-123-672; 022-902-688-590-396; 023-841-890-738-825; 027-962-030-524-698; 032-919-347-878-256; 036-236-363-062-794; 036-746-913-850-016; 040-925-649-098-029; 041-372-054-816-713; 041-445-286-706-809; 061-815-996-855-615; 080-873-038-602-184; 082-556-214-629-09X; 126-368-122-664-759; 127-016-670-476-238,2

Amit; Veincent Christian Filipino Pepito; Bernardo Gutierrez; Thomas Rawson,"Background: When a new pathogen emerges, consistent case reporting is critical for public health surveillance. Tracking cases geographically and over time is key for understanding the spread of an infectious disease and effectively designing interventions to contain and mitigate an epidemic. In this paper we describe the reporting systems on COVID-19 in Southeast Asia during the first wave in 2020, and highlight the impact of specific reporting methods. Methods: We reviewed key epidemiological variables from various sources including a regionally comprehensive dataset, national trackers, dashboards, and case bulletins for 11 countries during the first wave of the epidemic in Southeast Asia. We recorded timelines of shifts in epidemiological reporting systems and described the differences in how epidemiological data are reported across countries and timepoints. Results: Our findings suggest that countries in Southeast Asia generally reported precise and detailed epidemiological data during the first wave of the pandemic. Changes in reporting rarely occurred for demographic data, while reporting shifts for geographic and temporal data were frequent. Most countries provided COVID-19 individual-level data daily using HTML and PDF, necessitating scraping and extraction before data could be used in analyses. Conclusion: Our study highlights the importance of more nuanced analyses of COVID-19 epidemiological data within and across countries because of the frequent shifts in reporting. As governments continue to respond to impacts on health and the economy, data sharing also needs to be prioritised given its foundational role in policymaking, and in the implementation and evaluation of interventions.",9,,662842,662842,Epidemiology; Geography; Psychological intervention; Public health surveillance; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Emerging infectious disease; Timeline; Pandemic; Environmental health,COVID- 19; Southeast Asia; data sharing; emerging infectious disease; epidemiological data,"Asia, Southeastern/epidemiology; COVID-19; Humans; Information Dissemination; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2",,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8242246 https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-1295720 https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.662842 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34222173/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.662842/full https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/77d5da2f-377a-3548-9f3d-141d67b61b4a/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34222173,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.662842,34222173,10.3389/fpubh.2021.662842,3172570741,PMC8242246,0,000-205-709-962-40X; 002-644-531-245-08X; 004-161-934-669-342; 004-420-310-017-403; 007-273-215-032-99X; 008-265-701-006-638; 011-157-290-464-385; 013-536-756-779-50X; 013-651-604-765-41X; 014-126-047-141-671; 016-267-593-890-591; 018-480-820-947-507; 019-009-330-569-023; 020-661-012-348-711; 022-526-129-975-007; 023-690-327-778-531; 024-039-439-793-748; 024-452-109-971-301; 025-519-162-196-746; 025-799-703-968-227; 030-497-017-511-339; 031-747-239-767-319; 037-574-958-291-594; 038-958-100-174-759; 040-378-365-649-909; 046-786-596-556-014; 047-539-168-536-031; 048-812-202-487-618; 049-066-409-249-849; 050-934-584-539-985; 051-253-013-531-173; 052-555-426-372-844; 053-887-219-753-967; 059-624-919-164-34X; 070-462-022-251-464; 072-475-866-686-308; 082-973-874-222-84X; 083-342-254-386-283; 089-170-558-733-803; 092-441-591-029-324; 096-746-972-859-228; 105-143-143-440-149; 110-017-679-247-041; 114-992-382-997-705; 119-044-591-716-596; 119-418-198-041-143; 141-196-894-269-092; 152-188-537-897-065; 160-093-154-645-205; 178-950-857-765-630; 181-099-802-604-030,0

As the efforts to develop and implement EHR-based data sharing platforms mature and scale up worldwide, there is a need to evaluate the impact of these interventions and to weigh their relative risks and benefits, in order to inform evidence-based health policies. The aim of this work is to systematically characterise and appraise the demonstrated benefits and risks of sharing EHR with patients, by mapping them across the six domains of quality of care of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) analytical framework (ie, patient-centredness, effectiveness, efficiency, timeliness, equity and safety). Methods and analysis CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, HMIC, Medline/PubMed and PsycINFO databases will be searched from January 1997 to August 2017. Primary outcomes will include measures related with the six domains of quality of care of the IOM analytical framework. The quality of the studies will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool, the ROBINS-I Tool and the Drummond’s checklist. A narrative synthesis will be conducted for all included studies. Subgroup analysis will be performed by domain of quality of care domain and by time scale (ie, short-term, medium-term or long-term impact). The body of evidence will be summarised in a Summary of Findings table and its strength assessed according to the GRADE criteria. Ethics and dissemination This review does not require ethical approval as it will summarise published studies with non-identifiable data. This protocol complies with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines. Findings will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations, and patient partners will be included in summarising the research findings into lay summaries and reports.

As of 9 December 2020, according to WHO, this highly infectious virus has infected more than 67 million people and led to over 1.5 million deaths across the world.2 There is a growing body of evidence on the epidemiology of the condition, risk factors for poor outcomes and effects of interventions.3–9 The rapid generation of robust data is crucial to monitor, understand and mitigate the effects of COVID-19. The Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19 (EAVE II) database creates a national, real-time prospective cohort using Scotland’s health data infrastructure, to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 infection, patterns of healthcare use and outcomes, and insights into the effectiveness of and safety of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19.10 This work builds on an established cohort for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine and anti-viral assessment in Scotland EAVE (Early Estimation of Vaccine and Anti-Viral Effectiveness).11,12 EAVE is a dormant pandemic protocol that is part of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Pandemic Preparedness Research Portfolio and a platform for previous studies on influenza vaccine and antiviral assessment.",50,4,1064,1074,Epidemiology; Prospective cohort study; Cohort study; MEDLINE; Influenza vaccine; Medicine; Cohort; Database; Pandemic; Estimation,,COVID-19; Cohort Studies; Humans; Mosquito Control; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2,,National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme (13/34/14); Medical Research Council (MR/R008345/1) United Kingdom; Scottish Government; BREATHE-The Health Data Research Hub for Respiratory Health (MC_PC_19004); UK Research and Innovation Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund and delivered through Health Data Research UK,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34089614/ https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/50/4/1064/6294008 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8195245 http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab028 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8195245 https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/cohort-profile-early-pandemic-evaluation-and-enhanced-surveillanc http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089614 https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/cohort-profile-early-pandemic-evaluation-and-enhanced-surveillanc https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/78658/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34089614,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyab028,34089614,10.1093/ije/dyab028,3165993107,PMC8195245,0,005-277-447-595-578; 009-773-158-190-943; 018-990-513-704-070; 028-878-558-392-165; 042-869-269-183-01X; 043-112-265-786-018; 069-498-914-163-880; 082-705-788-821-28X; 089-822-438-474-297; 127-791-751-157-535,6

The scale, pace and novelty of these applications raise a number of urgent sociotechnical, ethical and legal questions, including optimal methods of data storage, management and access. Although the open science movement advocates unfettered access to research data, many of the UK’s longitudinal cohort studies operate systems of managed data access, in which access is governed by legal and ethical agreements between stewards of research datasets and researchers wishing to make use of them. Amongst other things, these agreements aim to respect the reasonable expectations of the research participants who provided data and samples, as expressed in the consent process. Arguably, responsible data management and governance of data and sample use are foundational to the consent process in longitudinal studies and are an important source of trustworthiness in the eyes of those who contribute data to genomic and biosocial research. This paper presents an ethnographic case study exploring the foundational principles of a governance infrastructure for Managing Ethico-social, Technical and Administrative issues in Data ACcess (METADAC), which are operationalised through a committee known as the METADAC Access Committee. METADAC governs access to phenotype, genotype and ‘omic’ data and samples from five UK longitudinal studies. Using the example of METADAC, we argue that three key structural features are foundational for practising responsible data sharing: independence and transparency; interdisciplinarity; and participant-centric decision-making. We observe that the international research community is proactively working towards optimising the use of research data, integrating/linking these data with routine data generated by health and social care services and other administrative data services to improve the analysis, interpretation and utility of these data. The governance of these new complex data assemblages will require a range of expertise from across a number of domains and disciplines, including that of study participants. Human-mediated decision-making bodies will be central to ensuring achievable, reasoned and responsible decisions about the use of these data; the METADAC model described in this paper provides an example of how this could be realised.",12,1,24,24,Sociotechnical system; Business; Data management; Qualitative research; Data governance; Data sharing; Corporate governance; Data access; Knowledge management; Data integration,Data Access Committee (DAC); Data access; Data ethics; Data governance; Ethnography; Governance; Interdisciplinarity; Participant involvement; Qualitative research,"Big Data; Biomedical Research/economics; Databases, Genetic/economics; Genomics/ethics; Genotype; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/N01104X/2) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (Grant Number: MR/N01104X/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/P023444/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/N01104X/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K007017/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_00011/5) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K006525/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G9815508) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12013/2) United Kingdom,https://aspace.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/275162 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695297 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40246-018-0154-6.pdf https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/250500 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/better-governance-better-access-practising-responsible-data-shari http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10047596/ https://humgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40246-018-0154-6 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5918902 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10047596/ https://doaj.org/article/733decf5a9504990937c04bf2531d84a https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/832513 https://www.weh.ox.ac.uk/publications/832513 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/26038/ https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/275162/1/40246_2018_Article_154.pdf https://ifs.org.uk/publications/13324 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/files/164356009/Full_text_PDF_final_published_version_.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40246-018-0154-6 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29695297/ https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/250500/21B1E23F-17FC-41D3-B035-97E8D7BDD7FF.pdf http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/221349/ https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/better-governance-better-access-practising-responsible-data-shari https://core.ac.uk/download/160810490.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40246-018-0154-6,29695297,10.1186/s40246-018-0154-6,2802220410,PMC5918902,0,000-422-212-157-932; 001-942-137-988-335; 002-637-506-591-946; 004-777-608-648-170; 007-727-361-767-306; 007-956-999-130-522; 010-027-967-887-346; 011-076-534-151-883; 011-197-154-422-507; 016-513-542-264-372; 017-217-687-793-654; 018-082-966-584-653; 019-753-987-588-531; 020-792-077-865-138; 025-740-725-758-507; 026-144-696-419-498; 026-354-057-561-047; 026-524-834-331-561; 037-550-015-414-716; 037-913-500-029-571; 048-382-477-690-730; 050-924-721-794-132; 052-204-111-416-131; 052-853-150-237-953; 053-474-155-799-521; 054-212-966-623-833; 054-622-613-921-618; 055-248-649-549-546; 058-973-699-699-025; 063-745-312-133-884; 066-584-001-420-987; 077-228-090-295-353; 077-568-722-463-88X; 078-145-866-744-80X; 092-302-509-105-202; 092-605-651-936-97X; 101-713-460-840-863; 102-775-220-229-061; 108-540-290-339-727; 109-895-401-678-262; 111-762-800-650-518; 113-371-151-644-998; 124-623-955-979-002; 149-110-421-319-687; 183-062-821-189-796; 186-670-491-897-885,21

However, the reuse of shared clinical trial data is not without obstacles. Here we present some of the issues and lessons learned from our own experiences in accessing and analyzing trial data; specifically, where we aim to combine and pool data from multiple different trials. In addition to issues around missing annotation and incomplete datasets, we identify trial-design complexity as a potential hurdle that may complicate downstream analyses. We address potential solutions and emphasize the need for benefits of transparent sharing and analysis of participant-level clinical trial data with appropriate risk mitigation, a matter important to efficient clinical research.",20,1,1,4,Reuse; Data science; Downstream (manufacturing); Annotation; Data sharing; Data reuse; Risk management; Clinical research; Clinical trial; Medicine,Clinical trials; Data sharing; Pooled analysis,Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Information Dissemination; Research Design,,Medical Research Council (MR/L011808/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/N00583X/1) United Kingdom,https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-019-3627-6 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6701093 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13063-019-3627-6.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13063-019-3627-6 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/clinical-trial-data-reuse--overcoming-complexities-in-trial-design-and-data-sharing(d582005f-ba6b-4218-a0d7-fac858c7a3c1).html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31426840/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-019-3627-6,31426840,10.1186/s13063-019-3627-6,2966696311,PMC6701093,0,007-242-464-566-106; 015-781-575-530-328; 016-365-837-816-953; 016-618-244-678-631; 028-338-671-731-168; 031-599-514-334-824; 044-885-278-219-179; 067-481-268-141-412; 069-092-765-600-767; 074-534-782-291-958; 114-654-851-742-78X,7

I. Bayley; Andrew O. M. Mogg; Andy Purvis; Heather J. Koldewey,"Marine protected areas (MPAs) are widely used as management tools to conserve species and ecosystems at risk from human impact. Coastal managers often focus MPA designation on biogenic reef environments due to their value and sensitivity to damage. However, difficulties in enforcement and a lack of capacity to adequately monitor MPAs often make it hard for managers to assess the effectiveness of MPAs, particularly in under‐resourced, low‐income coastal countries. Reef community data were collected at three long‐term managed reserves within the Western Visayas region of the central Philippines in order to assess the state of reef community structure inside and outside of these small‐scale locally managed MPAs. In addition, 3D structural data were captured using recently developed 'Structure from Motion' photogrammetry techniques, demonstrating how multiple quantitative metrics of physical structural complexity and health can be recorded in such analyses. These community‐run MPAs were shown to be effective even when small (10–20 ha). Mean fish biomass density was five times greater within present‐day protected sites, alongside significantly increased levels of fish diversity, richness, and size. No significant structural differences were observed inside and outside of MPAs; however, average reef rugosity, height, and roughness were significantly higher in unfished reefs compared to blast‐fished reefs. Reef substrate complexity, coral composition, and level of management, were also shown to structure fish community assemblages, with the link between reef structure and fish richness/abundance disrupted outside of MPAs. The Structure from Motion technique allows a greater range of quantitative morphometrics to be assessed than traditional methods and at relatively low cost. The technique is rapid, non‐destructive and can be archived, increasing the value of data for managers wishing to quantify reef health and efficiently monitor benthic changes through time. We discuss both the limitations and benefits of this technology's future use.",29,12,2026,2044,Biomass (ecology); Community structure; Rugosity; Blast fishing; Environmental science; Fishery; Species richness; Marine protected area; Reef; Benthic zone,,,,Natural Environment Research Council,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/aqc.3215 https://pure.uhi.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/evaluating-the-efficacy-of-smallscale-marine-protected-areas-for-preserving-reef-health(f10f1e5a-5b22-4375-ba43-2d4483106e97).html https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6793080 https://www.openchannels.org/literature/25789 https://pure.uhi.ac.uk/en/publications/evaluating-the-efficacy-of-smallscale-marine-protected-areas-for-,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.3215,,10.1002/aqc.3215,2973165398,,0,001-032-625-401-203; 002-894-107-448-12X; 003-392-623-750-33X; 005-412-768-499-383; 005-621-080-921-145; 005-646-799-614-745; 005-994-448-043-443; 006-428-823-899-471; 006-675-569-958-912; 008-306-835-688-652; 008-704-219-480-800; 008-989-660-642-841; 012-813-923-288-81X; 016-274-666-697-481; 016-550-638-696-498; 016-847-870-131-018; 019-990-992-471-636; 020-187-880-382-404; 020-610-220-757-448; 021-432-878-558-231; 021-448-305-549-991; 021-898-636-614-813; 022-113-809-982-90X; 022-451-480-119-343; 027-638-932-936-785; 029-045-353-261-225; 029-239-942-131-037; 031-659-496-121-228; 032-318-851-415-433; 035-941-666-283-356; 035-956-058-420-064; 035-957-018-704-358; 036-003-480-434-06X; 036-121-632-191-595; 043-193-366-604-444; 043-724-184-552-399; 047-268-094-357-222; 047-337-341-048-598; 047-482-997-250-159; 048-001-792-493-188; 048-230-898-362-089; 048-475-737-668-496; 048-661-409-312-748; 049-845-275-146-897; 050-301-120-240-686; 054-221-287-965-895; 057-030-559-047-762; 057-430-890-821-749; 058-265-088-096-703; 059-419-339-854-878; 060-562-438-331-252; 063-360-973-227-207; 063-443-266-490-413; 063-734-083-556-678; 064-843-462-451-170; 068-310-369-153-973; 069-236-658-484-852; 071-916-984-369-068; 072-776-567-997-340; 075-180-815-446-487; 076-387-665-037-171; 076-859-538-814-241; 078-301-271-361-22X; 078-557-648-641-125; 081-939-623-182-50X; 083-010-791-763-813; 083-499-640-523-675; 083-540-456-464-857; 084-784-500-499-414; 085-441-087-914-961; 087-453-384-189-023; 087-832-233-214-834; 087-992-559-532-253; 091-110-648-916-248; 092-297-970-484-235; 092-782-394-621-041; 096-651-153-729-575; 097-777-402-478-018; 098-476-006-022-26X; 100-021-013-635-602; 104-182-746-671-101; 111-002-344-790-75X; 115-749-919-576-166; 117-849-538-283-07X; 119-129-832-960-710; 123-367-685-118-58X; 127-289-030-308-176; 129-801-293-855-393; 133-264-526-806-992; 133-539-748-077-270; 143-484-784-493-527; 148-530-249-177-967; 151-754-835-459-618; 154-533-668-546-895; 181-160-033-232-243; 190-423-987-823-288,5

Salek; Christoph Steinbeck,"Chemical Biology employs chemical synthesis, analytical chemistry and other tools to study biological systems. Recent advances in both molecular biology such as next generation sequencing (NGS) have led to unprecedented insights towards the evolution of organisms' biochemical repertoires. Because of the specific data sharing culture in Genomics, genomes from all kingdoms of life become readily available for further analysis by other researchers. While the genome expresses the potential of an organism to adapt to external influences, the Metabolome presents a molecular phenotype that allows us to asses the external influences under which an organism exists and develops in a dynamic way. Steady advancements in instrumentation towards high-throughput and highresolution methods have led to a revival of analytical chemistry methods for the measurement and analysis of the metabolome of organisms. This steady growth of metabolomics as a field is leading to a similar accumulation of big data across laboratories worldwide as can be observed in all of the other omics areas. This calls for the development of methods and technologies for handling and dealing with such large datasets, for efficiently distributing them and for enabling re-analysis. Here we describe the recently emerging ecosystem of global open-access databases and data exchange efforts between them, as well as the foundations and obstacles that enable or prevent the data sharing and reanalysis of this data.",36,,58,63,Metabolome; Organism; Data exchange; Genomics; Metabolomics; Data science; Data sharing; Open data; Bioinformatics; Big data; Biology,,"Databases, Factual; Genome; Genomics/methods; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Metabolome; Metabolomics/methods; Phenotype; Systems Biology/methods",,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000933/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council ( BB/L024152/1) United Kingdom,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593116302083 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367593116302083 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.12.024 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1367593116302083 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5344029 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28092796/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5344029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.12.024,28092796,10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.12.024,2573125552,PMC5344029,0,001-388-216-070-172; 005-088-848-391-215; 005-653-137-906-912; 014-939-140-029-949; 016-273-291-086-400; 016-357-056-768-290; 020-080-430-516-209; 021-460-022-265-544; 023-197-301-130-922; 027-807-885-652-900; 032-947-331-381-550; 034-992-349-477-37X; 035-670-427-523-082; 039-555-448-774-018; 039-783-700-856-256; 042-022-622-430-197; 049-012-654-002-459; 049-870-718-146-410; 051-548-594-606-353; 054-040-525-317-867; 054-533-078-313-244; 056-552-829-431-53X; 056-790-779-670-48X; 057-608-673-474-854; 061-059-021-814-564; 066-287-635-793-768; 068-223-082-354-713; 071-666-416-855-114; 073-411-694-150-913; 074-273-534-252-025; 074-284-520-781-173; 077-095-626-813-563; 083-194-168-745-049; 083-659-319-453-762; 084-213-185-304-701; 085-882-395-201-561; 087-523-235-485-25X; 090-459-756-441-468; 092-789-842-769-907; 101-617-939-294-155; 106-830-212-684-771; 110-574-953-315-230; 111-315-748-980-08X; 118-403-451-766-132; 124-449-777-274-171; 125-377-617-574-892; 126-986-577-218-526; 128-969-029-122-302; 129-269-724-950-061; 139-450-735-972-855; 142-243-816-973-16X; 142-786-140-330-228; 172-434-063-597-496; 174-849-466-048-093; 175-191-619-226-179; 183-022-769-808-433; 195-099-134-262-597,25

Ware; Anneke Lucassen; Alison Hall; Anna Middleton; Nazneen Rahman; Sian Ellard; Helen V. Firth,"Sharing de-identified genetic variant data via custom-built online repositories is essential for the practice of genomic medicine and is demonstrably beneficial to patients. Robust genetic diagnoses that inform medical management cannot be made accurately without reference to genetic test results from other patients, population controls and correlation with clinical context and family history. Errors in this process can result in delayed, missed or erroneous diagnoses, leading to inappropriate or missed medical interventions for the patient and their family. The benefits of sharing individual genetic variants, and the harms of not sharing them, are numerous and well-established. Databases and mechanisms already exist to facilitate deposition and sharing of de-identified genetic variants, but clarity and transparency around best practice is needed to encourage widespread use, prevent inconsistencies between different communities, maximise individual privacy and ensure public trust. We therefore recommend that widespread sharing of a small number of genetic variants per individual, associated with limited clinical information, should become standard practice in genomic medicine. Information confirming or refuting the role of genetic variants in specific conditions is fundamental scientific knowledge from which everyone has a right to benefit, and therefore should not require consent to share. For additional case-level detail about individual patients or more extensive genomic information, which is often essential for individual clinical interpretation, it may be more appropriate to use a controlled-access model for such data sharing, with the ultimate aim of making as much information available as possible with appropriate governance.",4,,22,22,Internet privacy; Best practice; CLARITY; Public trust; MEDLINE; Data sharing; Context (language use); Population; Computer science; Medical diagnosis,data ethics; data sharing; medical genomics; variant,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UP_1102/20) United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31886409/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6913213/ https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-22 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6913213/ https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR104450 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-22/v2/xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15090.2,31886409,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15090.2,2912924767,PMC6913213,0,000-129-004-228-019; 001-610-630-749-994; 002-203-796-204-386; 002-552-996-730-183; 005-550-008-145-57X; 006-551-787-966-676; 006-681-175-522-383; 010-232-055-736-062; 011-083-383-798-65X; 011-164-146-144-323; 013-240-333-952-646; 014-425-309-442-141; 015-307-411-123-672; 016-555-073-400-460; 018-322-645-602-654; 022-671-399-938-143; 023-178-829-367-107; 023-474-058-772-740; 023-824-188-041-88X; 024-768-036-874-551; 025-176-878-218-443; 025-277-168-494-067; 025-358-459-950-864; 026-629-559-633-469; 027-268-201-967-89X; 028-176-809-501-48X; 029-268-206-974-530; 029-973-257-212-935; 031-923-955-763-335; 035-387-313-491-509; 036-855-305-545-432; 037-264-438-159-051; 037-295-889-904-489; 038-153-305-566-811; 038-235-267-601-274; 039-270-475-402-499; 040-059-033-991-70X; 043-105-960-054-593; 046-718-041-032-044; 047-985-504-801-739; 051-796-341-444-053; 053-370-563-090-523; 053-897-550-990-347; 055-875-724-942-43X; 063-402-525-465-255; 065-857-059-194-278; 066-197-125-723-998; 069-869-800-849-462; 072-318-773-202-408; 073-425-352-215-729; 074-723-345-340-283; 075-204-677-494-600; 075-764-553-101-161; 079-549-760-007-032; 085-791-006-672-535; 085-919-700-879-544; 087-670-515-684-675; 087-717-454-000-772; 091-110-421-619-820; 093-168-234-627-459; 093-907-724-436-643; 097-762-824-254-741; 100-858-694-520-337; 101-297-804-507-344; 107-158-439-318-278; 109-294-779-885-278; 113-595-164-011-180; 120-794-211-617-421; 123-918-123-442-343; 126-368-122-664-759; 127-016-670-476-238; 146-264-292-146-929; 153-579-164-869-620; 186-496-549-480-011,17

Wu,"Health planners from global to local levels must anticipate year-to-year and week-to-week variation in seasonal influenza activity when planning for and responding to epidemics to mitigate their impact. To help with this, countries routinely collect incidence of mild and severe respiratory illness and virologic data on circulating subtypes and use these data for situational awareness, burden of disease estimates and severity assessments. Advanced analytics and modelling are increasingly used to aid planning and response activities by describing key features of influenza activity for a given location and generating forecasts that can be translated to useful actions such as enhanced risk communications, and informing clinical supply chains. Here, we describe the formation of the Influenza Incidence Analytics Group (IIAG), a coordinated global effort to apply advanced analytics and modelling to public influenza data, both epidemiological and virologic, in real-time and thus provide additional insights to countries who provide routine surveillance data to WHO. Our objectives are to systematically increase the value of data to health planners by applying advanced analytics and forecasting and for results to be immediately reproducible and deployable using an open repository of data and code. We expect the resources we develop and the associated community to provide an attractive option for the open analysis of key epidemiological data during seasonal epidemics and the early stages of an influenza pandemic.",14,2,105,110,Epidemiology; Supply chain; Risk analysis (engineering); Public health; Situation awareness; Transmission (medicine); Burden of disease; Computer science; Global health; Analytics,forecasting; incidence; influenza,"Data Interpretation, Statistical; Disease Outbreaks/statistics & numerical data; Forecasting; Global Health; Health Planning/organization & administration; Humans; Incidence; Influenza, Human/epidemiology; Public Health/statistics & numerical data; Seasons",,US National Institutes of Health (GM110748) International; Wellcome Trust (200861/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (200187/Z/15/Z) United Kingdom; World Health Organization (001) International; US National Institutes of Health (T32ES023770) International; NIAID NIH HHS (F31 AI138410) United States; Department of Health United Kingdom; NIGMS NIH HHS (R35 GM119582) United States; Medical Research Council (MR/R015600/1) United Kingdom,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/75278/9/irv.12705.pdf https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/245334/PMC7040973.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32096594/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32096594 https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/75278 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/irv.12705 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1425738-coordinating-the-real-time-use-of-global-influenza-activity-data-for-better-public-health-planning http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7040973/ https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/coordinating-the-realtime-use-of-global-influenza-activity-data-for-better-public-health-planning(926b84df-a25b-4dbe-a965-ed3ad5074af5).html https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/183344881/irv.12705.pdf https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/245334 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/irv.12705 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/139491/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/irv.12705,32096594,10.1111/irv.12705,2992675448,PMC7040973,0,003-805-559-799-704; 004-810-269-239-293; 005-327-758-493-475; 010-721-006-501-889; 012-139-846-488-356; 012-214-743-908-909; 012-387-297-209-715; 016-711-649-729-130; 023-444-133-294-80X; 036-086-252-091-903; 036-425-949-975-534; 041-345-059-449-576; 044-030-023-424-732; 046-108-409-768-765; 048-776-321-404-939; 056-389-790-636-417; 056-398-329-411-759; 056-615-840-336-248; 057-797-811-817-700; 072-433-172-660-626; 083-860-048-335-776; 084-621-635-113-893; 085-740-051-963-358; 087-322-982-538-49X; 088-521-327-788-757; 089-304-890-525-10X; 091-023-477-938-956; 107-299-448-850-847; 117-270-693-498-609; 122-110-182-435-663; 126-494-346-867-093; 155-037-342-328-541,3

Emergency contraception and induced abortion are overlooked in policy and research. Men’s roles in the SRHR of others are significant, particularly as obstacles to universal SRHR. Evidence on gender, masculinities and SRHR is essential to understand and reduce the barriers faced by individuals seeking to avoid the conception or continuation of a pregnancy. Methods and analysis This study aims to understand men’s masculinities and their relationships with emergency contraception and abortion. The protocol presents a multimethod study of men aged over 18 years in James Town, Accra, Ghana. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the research will use two mobile-based methods: a survey and in-depth interviews. Using respondent-driven sampling, an estimated 789 men will be recruited to participate in the survey, asking questions on their knowledge, attitude, behaviours and roles in emergency contraception and abortion. In-depth interviews focused on constructions of masculinity will be conducted with a purposive sample of men who participated in the survey. Data will be analysed concurrently using multiple regression analyses of quantitative data and abductive analysis of qualitative data. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the London School of Economics and Political Science and the Ghana Health Service. The findings in this study will: engage with emerging research on masculinities and SRHR in Ghana and elsewhere; offer methodological insight for future research; and provide evidence to inform interventions to reduce obstacles for emergency contraception and abortion care seekers.

We aim to ask the ethical questions which will lead to the improvement of healthcare and we take an open-minded approach to finding answers to them over time. What is or should be meant by ‘personalised medicine’ is a major theme of this issue. It is a debate bound up with question of both values in the sense of ethical reflection and value in the sense of economic return. This editorial discusses and interrelates the articles of the issue under four headings: the promise and the hype of personalised medicine; the human person and the communication of risk; data sharing and participation; value, equity and power.

Barnes; Julio Arturo Canario; Sunil S Vernekar; Shivaprasad S. Goudar; Roberto Espinal; Laura Merson; Phaik Yeong Cheah,"Data sharing is increasingly mandated by health research funders and publishers. In the context of data collected in low-resource settings, concerns have been raised regarding inequitable opportunities to engage in secondary use of data between researchers in well-resourced and resource-limited settings. In this context, we present three case studies and their issues related to equity: the multicountry Antenatal Corticosteroid Trial, health research in the Dominican Repulic and the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network. These case studies were discussed at the 2018 Global Forum for Bioethics in Research in South Africa, focussing on the theme “The ethics of data sharing and biobanking in health research”. The case studies provide concrete examples of real challenges such as lack of prior consent for data sharing, potential for misinterpretation of data by secondary users and limited capacity of researchers in low-resource settings to conduct secondary analyses. We conclude by suggesting ways forward. We stress the importance of capacity building and investments in data management and data science skills, and in data sharing platforms supporting poverty-related disease research. In addition, we recommend that there should be incentives to promote data sharing and that research groups and institutions establish their own data sharing policies  tailored to their context, data and community while persuing harmonization with existing policies as much as possible. We also think that international guidelines on authorship criteria should be revisited. For new studies, researchers should obtain consent for sharing of participants’ data with secondary users. Lastly we recommend that community and stakeholder engagement be conducted to improve the consent process and identify what might be sensitive data to mitigate any potential harms to data subjects and their communities.",4,,172,,Biobank; Business; Data management; Bioethics; Equity (finance); Capacity building; Data sharing; Context (language use); Stakeholder engagement; Public relations,,,,"Medical Research Council; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; National Institutes of Health; Exxon Mobil Corporation; Wellcome Trust; Wellcome Trust; Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)’s Global Network for Women and Children’s Health Research, USA; National Research Center on Child and Maternal Health Dr. Hugo Mendoza (CENISMI).",https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-172 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1120948 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-172/v1/xml https://www.tropmedres.ac/publications/1120948 https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/1120948 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/1120948,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15425.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15425.1,2988029011,,0,001-915-854-894-477; 003-348-966-947-646; 006-565-656-719-605; 008-683-828-683-451; 009-979-856-274-689; 012-459-081-102-118; 014-674-282-934-943; 016-282-586-324-263; 016-360-146-819-925; 021-647-780-229-032; 023-097-073-292-349; 024-803-376-872-350; 025-454-049-903-758; 028-989-959-754-042; 029-684-352-258-981; 030-804-649-042-451; 031-814-590-043-737; 039-977-325-484-221; 042-355-275-020-040; 051-573-338-288-08X; 057-326-382-019-24X; 060-711-673-569-152; 067-221-569-108-471; 067-235-854-748-766; 074-970-304-363-92X; 076-999-905-905-239; 079-355-774-775-491; 085-318-500-089-798; 087-036-518-204-018; 087-447-062-490-912; 092-806-914-705-745; 094-834-168-358-542; 096-742-036-084-660; 097-628-129-516-247; 100-825-939-225-555; 125-316-486-237-140; 126-871-425-351-950; 130-616-424-529-063; 135-302-870-468-483; 141-061-239-754-253; 148-436-954-441-400,5

Tussyadiah; Yang Lu,"In light of mounting privacy concerns over the increasing collection and use of biometric and behavioral information for travel facilitation, this study examines travelers’ online privacy concerns (TOPC) and its impact on willingness to share data with travel providers. A proposed theoretical model explaining antecedents and outcomes of TOPC related to biometric and behavioral data sharing was tested using structural equation modeling with data collected from 685 travelers. The results extend the Antecedents – Privacy Concerns – Outcomes (APCO) framework by identifying a set of salient individual factors that shape TOPC. The findings provide empirical evidence confirming the context dependence of privacy preferences, showing that although travelers are concerned over their information privacy they are still willing to share their behavioral data; while in the case of biometric information, the disclosure decision is dependent upon expected benefits rather than privacy concerns. This study offers insights into privacy behavior of online consumers in the travel context and constitutes one of the few focusing on the social aspects of biometric authentication.",54,,102122,,Internet privacy; Information privacy; Set (psychology); Empirical evidence; Biometrics; Context (language use); Salient; Behavioral data; Computer science; Structural equation modeling,,,,UK’s Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/81190/ https://ray.yorksj.ac.uk/id/eprint/5169/ https://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/854100/ https://surrey.eprints-hosting.org/854100/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijinfoman/ijinfoman54.html#IoannouTL20 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401219317311,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102122,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2020.102122,3015030707,,0,000-743-503-529-22X; 000-892-408-554-493; 003-118-998-063-278; 003-264-306-410-01X; 003-617-900-052-404; 004-082-480-505-347; 004-727-611-489-638; 005-457-107-035-994; 006-113-740-631-844; 007-148-299-778-584; 009-292-371-162-047; 010-627-907-767-210; 012-817-104-716-567; 015-241-693-828-590; 015-482-248-474-39X; 015-570-098-276-821; 015-743-513-190-818; 016-773-780-573-921; 023-609-631-604-594; 024-523-194-463-373; 027-966-542-584-81X; 028-635-629-323-719; 028-932-205-814-750; 031-175-486-141-734; 031-732-275-611-58X; 032-690-735-556-088; 033-171-354-077-456; 033-988-631-393-497; 034-193-000-896-140; 035-511-700-949-132; 036-423-699-421-547; 036-861-563-006-547; 043-213-633-162-472; 044-352-611-433-522; 044-700-027-212-411; 044-763-858-798-124; 045-420-627-418-480; 045-672-153-707-432; 045-968-337-223-689; 046-198-865-911-547; 049-356-430-024-623; 053-703-026-288-959; 054-492-060-177-987; 057-928-534-117-972; 058-777-287-783-898; 059-693-586-833-304; 060-071-907-003-651; 063-331-870-462-551; 065-128-049-128-971; 068-362-445-193-219; 069-625-520-895-367; 070-130-654-199-130; 076-641-631-123-216; 080-942-863-070-874; 083-357-477-276-200; 084-021-077-814-775; 084-961-631-599-698; 087-030-533-812-25X; 088-421-809-744-118; 089-168-546-618-506; 093-241-568-122-002; 094-799-587-437-965; 095-938-126-976-791; 097-396-089-278-570; 100-436-172-024-424; 101-442-155-142-418; 105-922-495-132-847; 105-922-577-732-942; 105-985-620-108-888; 107-977-201-221-993; 111-705-252-981-883; 113-208-511-429-504; 121-072-864-778-259; 123-325-963-166-413; 124-190-102-429-972; 125-586-628-580-201; 128-988-396-733-184; 130-749-674-951-653; 133-015-162-140-271; 138-674-119-690-463; 147-608-106-186-699; 162-190-464-060-285; 162-306-764-014-610; 168-411-150-435-456; 171-423-614-117-808; 172-152-657-543-182; 178-347-732-094-080; 181-809-755-765-694; 182-787-468-538-263; 183-252-714-295-275; 186-399-589-242-590; 189-396-564-811-086; 191-423-222-859-023; 197-537-527-960-281; 198-728-084-233-525,14

Godolphin; Philip M.W. Bath; Alan A Montgomery,"Objective Systematic reviews often rely on the acquisition of unpublished analyses or data. We carried out a nested randomised trial comparing two different approaches for contacting authors to request additional data for a systematic review. Participants Participants were authors of published reports of prevention or treatment trials in stroke in which there was central adjudication of events. A primary and secondary research active author were selected as contacts for each trial. Interventions Authors were randomised to be sent either a short email with a protocol of the systematic review attached (‘Short’) or a longer email that contained detailed information and without the protocol attached (‘Long’). A maximum of two emails were sent to each author to obtain a response. The unit of analysis was trial, accounting for clustering by author. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome was whether a response was received from authors. Secondary outcomes included time to response, number of reminders needed before a response was received and whether authors agreed to collaborate. Results 88 trials with 76 primary authors were identified in the systematic review, and of these, 36 authors were randomised to Short (trials=45) and 40 to Long (trials=43). Responses were received for 69 trials. There was no evidence of a difference in response rate between trial arms (Short vs Long, OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.33).

2006,028-755-196-917-488,Polarity and Attitude Effects in the Continued-Influence Paradigm,,2019,journal article,Journal of Memory and Language,0749596x; 10960821,Elsevier BV,United States,Andrew Gordon; Ullrich K. H. Ecker; Stephan Lewandowsky,"Abstract Misinformation – information that is false or inaccurate – can continue to influence people’s memory and reasoning even after it has been corrected. Researchers have termed this the continued influence effect (CIE). However, to date, research has focused exclusively on examining the CIE in a single polarity, namely the ongoing effect of initially affirmed material that is later negated. No research has yet examined how reliance on outdated information may be affected if this polarity is reversed, that is, if initially-negated information is reinstated. It also remains unclear how participants’ pre-existing beliefs may impact the acceptance of a correction, with prior evidence showing conflicting results. To investigate these questions, across two experiments we presented participants scoring high versus low on measures of relevant attitudes with fictional news reports that contained a piece of critical attitude-relevant information. This information was either true throughout, false throughout, initially-affirmed then retracted, or initially-negated then reinstated. Participants’ reliance on the critical information was subsequently measured with the use of inferential-reasoning items. Reinstatement of initially-negated information was insufficient to bring reliance on that information to a baseline level – that is, reliance on information presented as true throughout was greater than reliance on negated and then reinstated information. This result was symmetrical with the conventional CIE observed with a reversed polarity. The effect of participants’ pre-existing attitudes on continued reliance was equivocal. The results therefore suggest that the CIE is not contingent on polarity, raising questions about the cognitive mechanisms underlying the effect.",108,,104028,,Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Negation; Misinformation; Raising (linguistics); Baseline level; Reversed polarity; Polarity (physics),,,,World University Network; University of Bristol; Australian Research Council to Ullrich Ecker and Stephan Lewandowsky; EPSRC,https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/polarity-and-attitude-effects-in-the-continuedinfluence-paradigm(6df9c8ad-7e63-4516-89bf-bbf49494d064).html https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/polarity-and-attitude-effects-in-the-continued-influence-paradigm https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X19300592 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/polarity-and-attitude-effects-in-the-continued-influence-paradigm,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2019.104028,,10.1016/j.jml.2019.104028,2952040358,,0,003-704-353-801-095; 003-862-912-108-312; 005-521-831-294-077; 006-387-127-116-367; 007-715-107-004-516; 007-847-455-606-200; 008-765-667-849-113; 010-784-227-055-016; 011-738-444-594-920; 013-702-161-895-027; 014-007-099-735-349; 016-497-605-201-751; 020-040-552-779-238; 020-106-606-796-893; 021-091-793-853-511; 022-246-385-962-575; 022-282-806-874-441; 032-049-177-406-929; 034-399-990-171-379; 034-937-691-844-161; 035-466-534-087-345; 036-582-167-898-609; 041-237-580-296-170; 042-804-055-385-25X; 042-868-676-432-752; 046-622-317-412-19X; 051-083-862-616-631; 053-459-201-895-587; 053-618-825-807-923; 056-938-462-750-324; 059-579-094-234-509; 059-740-023-861-001; 067-165-710-052-590; 067-894-587-035-196; 071-201-743-168-178; 077-271-476-458-868; 081-138-602-636-488; 084-086-836-198-940; 086-245-322-403-36X; 091-331-440-548-019; 093-106-151-967-745; 095-220-689-564-712; 101-234-229-707-033; 102-278-067-148-427; 103-854-123-090-24X; 110-671-025-667-203; 114-728-792-322-759; 115-087-071-547-412; 120-735-129-332-136; 127-868-046-533-796; 135-830-531-842-847; 136-457-209-586-148; 137-195-625-784-089; 143-157-613-858-693; 152-313-615-159-27X; 153-251-413-056-112; 170-215-158-792-814; 170-511-578-648-743; 170-760-323-431-232; 171-505-386-709-359; 194-382-788-265-620,3

Gibson; Gregory Scott; Oliver Harrison; Anna Dominiczak; Philip Hanlon,"Background: The global burden of disease is increasingly dominated by non-communicable diseases.These diseases are less amenable to curative and preventative interventions than communicable disease. This presents a challenge to medical practice and medical research, both of which are experiencing diminishing returns from increasing investment. Objective: Our aim was to (1) review how medical knowledge is generated, and its limitations, (2) assess the potential for emerging technologies and ideas to improve medical research, and (3) suggest solutions and recommendations to increase medical research efficiency on non-communicable diseases. Methods: We undertook an unsystematic review of peer-reviewed literature and technology websites. Results: Our review generated the following conclusions and recommendations. (1) Medical knowledge continues to be generated in a reductionist paradigm. This oversimplifies our models of disease, rendering them ineffective to sufficiently understand the complex nature of non-communicable diseases. (2) Some of these failings may be overcome by adopting a “Systems Medicine” paradigm, where the human body is modeled as a complex adaptive system. That is, a system with multiple components and levels interacting in complex ways, wherein disease emerges from slow changes to the system set-up. Pursuing systems medicine research will require larger datasets. (3) Increased data sharing between researchers, patients, and clinicians could provide this unmet need for data. The recent emergence of electronic health care records (EHR) could potentially facilitate this in real-time and at a global level. (4) Efforts should continue to aggregate anonymous EHR data into large interoperable data silos and release this to researchers. However, international collaboration, data linkage, and obtaining additional information from patients will remain challenging. (5) Efforts should also continue towards “Medicine 2.0”. Patients should be given access to their personal EHR data. Subsequently, online communities can give researchers the opportunity to ask patients for direct access to the patient’s EHR data and request additional study-specific information. However, selection bias towards patients who use Web 2.0 technology may be difficult to overcome. Conclusions: Systems medicine, when combined with large-scale data sharing, has the potential to raise our understanding of non-communicable diseases, foster personalized medicine, and make substantial progress towards halting, curing, and preventing non-communicable diseases. Large-scale data amalgamation remains a core challenge and needs to be supported. A synthesis of “Medicine 2.0” and “Systems Science” concepts into “Systems Medicine 2.0” could take decades to materialize but holds much promise.

Frey; Colin Leonard Bird,"It is arguably a precept that the open sharing of data maximises the scientific utility of the research that generated that data. Indeed, progress depends on individual scientists being able to build on the results produced by others. The means to facilitate sharing undoubtedly exist, but various studies have identified reluctance among researchers to share information with their peers, at least until the professional priorities of the original researchers have been accommodated. With a view to encouraging less inhibited collaboration, we appraise the processes of data exchange from the perspective of a trading environment and consider how data exchanges might promote (or perhaps hinder) collaboration in data-rich scientific research disciplines and how such an exchange might be set up. We suggest an exchange with trusted brokers (akin to the commodity markets) as a way to overcome the challenges of the current environment. We conclude by encouraging the scientific and technical community to debate the merits of a trading perspective on data sharing and exchange.",28,10,989,996,Business; Data exchange; Set (psychology); Perspective (graphical); Commodity; Information Dissemination; Precept; Data sharing; Cooperative behavior; Knowledge management,,Cooperative Behavior; Information Dissemination/methods; Research/organization & administration; Statistics as Topic,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/D00652X) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-014-9785-4 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25113779 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014JCAMD..28..989F/abstract https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10822-014-9785-4 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10822-014-9785-4.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4196031 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jcamd/jcamd28.html#FreyB14 https://paperity.org/p/36975588/scientific-and-technical-data-sharing-a-trading-perspective https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/395500/ http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10822-014-9785-4 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10822-014-9785-4/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10822-014-9785-4,25113779,10.1007/s10822-014-9785-4,1992633332,PMC4196031,0,003-254-479-923-236; 010-389-916-295-197; 010-556-177-342-193; 022-721-428-651-305; 025-807-776-125-746; 027-023-263-980-939; 030-967-973-187-499; 054-179-007-882-23X; 065-827-375-538-012; 098-602-012-878-552; 099-852-869-487-663; 102-308-210-932-64X; 115-966-041-821-725; 131-279-826-235-748; 179-008-547-352-025; 197-500-232-702-809,3

Accurate public health messaging is essential to counter this, but education may also have a role. Early in the outbreak, The London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine partnered with FutureLearn to develop a massive open online course (MOOC) on COVID-19. Our approach was grounded in social constructivism, supporting participation, sharing uncertainties, and encouraging discussion. The first run of the course included over 200,000 participants from 184 countries, with over 88,000 comments at the end of the three-week run. Many participants supported each other’s learning in their responses and further questions. Our experience suggests that open education, and supporting the development of communities of learners, can complement traditional messaging, providing a sustainable approach to countering the spread of misinformation.</ns4:p>",5,,105,,,,,,Department of Health & Social Care; Wellcome Trust,,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15973.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15973.1,,,0,013-444-492-765-519; 056-006-599-468-848; 111-631-194-906-762; 120-188-212-674-372,2

It offers instant access to almost any type of information, along with the ability to share that information with others. The aim of this paper is to critically assess the enhancement potential of the Internet. We argue that unconditional access to information does not lead to cognitive enhancement. The Internet is not a simple, uniform technology, either in its composition, or in its use. We will look into why the Internet as an informational resource currently fails to enhance cognition. We analyze some of the phenomena that emerge from vast, continual fluxes of information-information overload, misinformation and persuasive design-and show how they could negatively impact users' cognition. Methods for mitigating these negative impacts are then advanced: individual empowerment, better collaborative systems for sorting and categorizing information, and the use of artificial intelligence assistants that could guide users through the informational space of today's Internet.",26,4,2345,2362,Internet privacy; The Internet; Cognition; Information overload; Empowerment; Misinformation; Human enhancement; Computer science; Resource (project management); Collaboration,Cognitive enhancement; Information overload; Internet; Misinformation; Persuasive design,Artificial Intelligence; Cognition; Humans; Internet; Persuasive Communication; Technology,,"Murdoch Children's Research Institute; Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii; Wellcome Centre for Ethics and Humanities",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7417391 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/see/see26.html#VoineaVMS20 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-020-00210-8 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32253711/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11948-020-00210-8.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/VOITIA-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11948-020-00210-8,32253711,10.1007/s11948-020-00210-8,3014103690,PMC7417391,0,000-820-372-970-176; 000-869-607-418-608; 000-898-908-027-734; 001-410-794-638-645; 002-692-689-025-403; 003-205-157-906-010; 003-413-350-037-116; 003-712-004-091-961; 007-997-582-769-962; 010-423-042-177-734; 012-981-239-609-288; 014-168-999-234-766; 014-392-005-189-636; 014-729-436-502-613; 017-697-666-754-731; 021-764-152-097-510; 023-097-431-986-413; 024-942-920-326-290; 025-271-384-564-536; 026-563-687-729-781; 029-018-635-018-764; 029-541-871-675-914; 033-334-283-232-335; 033-890-658-530-29X; 036-695-076-794-370; 037-743-862-202-918; 038-196-730-539-371; 041-802-029-980-869; 049-673-360-148-063; 050-616-897-222-862; 051-579-865-366-905; 053-309-571-181-430; 053-845-429-017-698; 054-239-691-884-62X; 055-807-088-113-125; 058-505-707-925-671; 060-505-322-279-500; 061-646-630-453-211; 064-180-382-869-548; 067-204-376-677-534; 072-234-674-184-728; 075-607-234-687-987; 075-980-527-017-587; 076-616-261-814-014; 081-034-851-964-208; 081-179-030-180-921; 081-602-815-382-545; 085-625-834-116-805; 086-430-524-386-072; 086-993-701-614-697; 089-701-406-393-504; 093-382-506-344-717; 096-954-925-926-13X; 097-343-762-938-673; 102-948-122-940-477; 113-965-123-855-956; 119-400-269-442-839; 126-255-792-943-035; 126-803-914-363-843; 139-761-306-409-325; 143-156-099-472-848; 154-677-497-579-010; 156-693-085-119-803; 169-017-030-383-293; 169-079-233-335-535; 178-552-595-672-499; 186-059-802-012-698; 190-892-644-765-903,14

The UK government continues to invest in research centres to encourage use of these data, and trials and cohort studies utilise data linkage methods in the follow-up of participants. This does not come without its limitations and challenges, such as data access delays.; ; ; Objective; This paper outlines the challenges faced by three projects utilising individual-level routinely-collected linked data for the longer-term follow-up of participants.; ; ; Methods; These studies are varied in design, study population and data providers. One researcher was common to the three studies and collated relevant study correspondence, formal documentary evidence such as data sharing agreements and, where relevant, meeting records to review. Key themes were identified and reviewed by other members of the research teams. Mitigating strategies were identified and discussed with a data provider representative and a broader group of researchers to finalise the recommendations presented.; ; ; Results; The challenges discussed are grouped into five themes: Data application process; Project timelines; Dependencies and considerations related to consent; Information Governance; Contractual. In presenting our results descriptively we summarise each case study, identify the main cross-cutting themes and consider the potential for mitigation of challenges.; ; ; Conclusions; We make recommendations that identify responsibilities for both researchers and data providers for mitigating and managing data access challenges. A continued conversation within the research community and with data providers is needed to continue to enable researchers to access and utilise the wealth of routinely-collected data available. The suggestions made in this paper will help researchers be better prepared to deal with the challenges of applying for data from multiple data providers.",3,3,432,432,Data collection; Record linkage; Business; Government; Information governance; Data sharing; Timeline; Data access; Knowledge management; Linked data,,,,Medical Research Council (MR/K023233/1) United Kingdom,https://ijpds.org/article/view/432 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095522 https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/114102/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34095522 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8142952 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34095522/ https://core.ac.uk/download/160606703.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v3i3.432,34095522,10.23889/ijpds.v3i3.432,2889854355,PMC8142952,0,006-258-632-472-484; 008-623-747-755-05X; 012-627-203-763-118; 013-699-594-985-621; 016-018-786-272-055; 018-426-391-090-527; 021-719-302-615-035; 026-278-871-119-42X; 032-212-952-923-036; 037-278-900-990-134; 043-804-074-862-118; 045-284-919-482-210; 049-820-363-291-225; 050-100-008-655-530; 057-317-748-898-134; 064-194-216-492-834; 064-194-935-361-873; 064-211-963-922-166; 143-333-615-591-996; 148-423-226-970-301; 162-725-859-796-180; 181-109-504-938-610,14

H. Ecker,"Misinformation can undermine a well-functioning democracy. For example, public misconceptions about climate change can lead to lowered acceptance of the reality of climate change and lowered support for mitigation policies. This study experimentally explored the impact of misinformation about climate change and tested several pre-emptive interventions designed to reduce the influence of misinformation. We found that false-balance media coverage (giving contrarian views equal voice with climate scientists) lowered perceived consensus overall, although the effect was greater among free-market supporters. Likewise, misinformation that confuses people about the level of scientific agreement regarding anthropogenic global warming (AGW) had a polarizing effect, with free-market supporters reducing their acceptance of AGW and those with low free-market support increasing their acceptance of AGW. However, we found that inoculating messages that (1) explain the flawed argumentation technique used in the misinformation or that (2) highlight the scientific consensus on climate change were effective in neutralizing those adverse effects of misinformation. We recommend that climate communication messages should take into account ways in which scientific content can be distorted, and include pre-emptive inoculation messages.",12,5,e0175799,,Global warming; Climate change; Psychology; Misinformation; Scientific consensus; Contrarian; Science policy; Media coverage; Argumentation theory; Social psychology,,Climate Change; Information Services/standards,,Australian Research Council; Royal Society; Psychonomics Society,https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175799 https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/neutralizing-misinformation-through-inoculation-exposing-misleadi https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/neutralizing-misinformation-through-inoculation(57d3b0eb-c66c-4ffc-88da-a43e7d918940).html https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799&type=printable https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/115433374/Full_text_PDF_final_published_version_.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/83929928 https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/115433374/Full_text_PDF_final_published_version_.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PLoSO..1275799C/abstract https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/neutralizing-misinformation-through-inoculation-exposing-misleadi http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5419564 https://doaj.org/article/95e6c419940347d2bd92c91fdc9c3072 http://mars.gmu.edu/handle/1920/11372 https://www.downes.ca/post/71124/rd https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0175799 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/69225b57-6a4c-3b02-a900-a622b3c2b236/ https://paperity.org/p/80265629/neutralizing-misinformation-through-inoculation-exposing-misleading-argumentation https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5419564/ https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/neutralizing-misinformation-through-inoculation-exposing-misleadi https://core.ac.uk/download/83929928.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175799,28475576,10.1371/journal.pone.0175799,2610353045,PMC5419564,0,002-100-479-952-709; 003-704-353-801-095; 004-378-687-886-928; 006-565-963-643-313; 006-773-150-665-765; 007-313-703-135-756; 008-473-671-870-834; 010-340-110-537-989; 010-444-274-512-768; 011-753-294-162-828; 014-250-483-708-265; 015-811-718-701-441; 016-078-295-355-563; 017-341-265-989-495; 017-533-943-435-165; 018-394-383-789-051; 021-183-820-391-542; 021-395-339-186-969; 022-708-713-430-935; 022-786-281-831-324; 022-827-397-563-825; 025-690-180-785-886; 028-575-198-138-041; 031-336-890-854-263; 034-441-714-663-314; 035-187-818-193-455; 035-686-526-062-011; 039-062-667-482-44X; 040-546-236-746-825; 041-757-661-098-730; 046-622-317-412-19X; 048-212-758-611-873; 053-459-201-895-587; 053-926-384-786-761; 054-649-243-267-005; 056-470-842-934-44X; 058-449-694-762-741; 061-351-939-535-890; 064-042-690-445-856; 065-220-754-840-691; 066-898-778-531-960; 067-165-710-052-590; 067-247-298-092-564; 068-243-401-701-54X; 070-274-424-303-396; 073-774-791-038-387; 073-939-105-673-018; 077-066-115-469-243; 077-689-252-823-182; 081-164-404-101-086; 081-831-462-492-237; 083-077-957-731-536; 095-617-071-347-543; 097-328-829-188-278; 106-399-124-384-116; 106-686-726-450-979; 109-723-350-470-11X; 110-507-584-173-125; 121-486-514-737-991; 121-643-080-472-59X; 122-553-426-244-728; 127-868-046-533-796; 133-027-466-218-056; 135-405-037-143-197; 141-291-809-896-258; 147-546-746-083-945; 155-377-850-105-927; 171-505-386-709-359; 175-968-898-849-829; 185-583-432-618-274; 187-699-073-642-877,281

Hernandez,"Electronic health records (EHRs) can be a major tool in the quest to decrease costs and timelines of clinical trial research, generate better evidence for clinical decision making, and advance health care. Over the past decade, EHRs have increasingly offered opportunities to speed up, streamline, and enhance clinical research. EHRs offer a wide range of possible uses in clinical trials, including assisting with prestudy feasibility assessment, patient recruitment, and data capture in care delivery. To fully appreciate these opportunities, health care stakeholders must come together to face critical challenges in leveraging EHR data, including data quality/completeness, information security, stakeholder engagement, and increasing the scale of research infrastructure and related governance. Leaders from academia, government, industry, and professional societies representing patient, provider, researcher, industry, and regulator perspectives convened the Leveraging EHR for Clinical Research Now! Think Tank in Washington, DC (February 18-19, 2016), to identify barriers to using EHRs in clinical research and to generate potential solutions. Think tank members identified a broad range of issues surrounding the use of EHRs in research and proposed a variety of solutions. Recognizing the challenges, the participants identified the urgent need to look more deeply at previous efforts to use these data, share lessons learned, and develop a multidisciplinary agenda for best practices for using EHRs in clinical research. We report the proceedings from this think tank meeting in the following paper.",202,,13,19,Professional association; Government; Health care; Best practice; Data quality; Patient recruitment; Stakeholder engagement; Information security; Knowledge management; Medicine,,Biomedical Research; Clinical Trials as Topic; Electronic Health Records; Health Information Interoperability; Humans; Information Dissemination; Informed Consent; Patient Reported Outcome Measures,,"AstraZeneca; Amgen; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; J&J Medical Device Companies; Pfizer; St Jude Medical, Inc; The Medicines Company",https://core.ac.uk/display/159754688 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1255536 https://utsouthwestern.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/leveraging-electronic-health-records-for-clinical-research https://einstein.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/leveraging-electronic-health-records-for-clinical-research http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29802975 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002870318301388 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29802975 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/164877/ https://core.ac.uk/download/159754688.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ahj.2018.04.015,29802975,10.1016/j.ahj.2018.04.015,2802191091,,0,001-259-008-854-289; 001-533-979-423-368; 003-652-274-366-732; 005-066-372-532-440; 006-303-031-317-681; 007-587-406-481-300; 008-274-458-092-445; 013-005-325-123-784; 015-162-092-047-769; 016-618-244-678-631; 017-284-071-800-502; 020-405-083-990-346; 024-198-157-569-375; 025-172-707-508-798; 028-938-670-021-69X; 029-016-683-245-516; 030-295-481-017-611; 031-540-312-730-611; 031-725-805-353-309; 035-512-982-350-877; 035-592-863-692-180; 036-016-023-626-560; 039-966-415-878-511; 040-101-240-131-012; 041-166-847-536-597; 043-849-667-094-440; 047-485-864-516-957; 047-610-159-417-697; 049-989-488-206-788; 054-473-934-918-341; 057-220-832-266-542; 058-014-040-395-29X; 059-124-523-480-193; 064-422-688-303-36X; 066-748-061-274-713; 068-955-139-334-320; 072-461-224-334-610; 073-006-383-173-078; 073-567-818-013-226; 078-605-593-376-03X; 081-701-335-582-832; 082-305-465-001-305; 084-620-046-612-577; 087-077-671-135-849; 087-296-461-204-818; 088-653-728-656-717; 092-068-822-606-406; 092-966-982-399-156; 094-395-716-067-93X; 095-031-765-468-35X; 110-588-609-235-386; 110-756-842-556-338; 112-239-340-012-864; 115-958-780-648-786; 117-003-631-142-088; 128-191-046-842-913; 150-392-983-465-495; 156-590-296-640-840; 180-692-122-657-631; 190-472-119-693-234,22

This paper summarizes presentations and discussions at the meeting related with the main results and advances in exposome research achieved through the EXPOsOMICS project; on other parallel research initiatives on the study of the exposome in Europe and in the United States and their complementarity to EXPOsOMICS; lessons learned from these early studies on the exposome and how they may shape the future of research on environmental exposure assessment; and finally the broader implications of exposome research for risk assessment and policy development on environmental exposures. The main results of EXPOsOMICS in relation to studies of the external exposome and internal exposome in relation to both air pollution and water contaminants were presented as well as new technologies for environmental health research (adductomics) and advances in statistical methods. Although exposome research strengthens the scientific basis for policy development, there is a need in terms of showing added value for public health to: improve communication of research results to non-scientific audiences; target research to the broader landscape of societal challenges; and draw applicable conclusions. Priorities for future work include the development and standardization of methodologies and technologies for assessing the external and internal exposome, improved data sharing and integration, and the demonstration of the added value of exposome science over conventional approaches in answering priority policy questions.",18,1,260,260,Exposome; Work (electrical); Standardization; Emerging technologies; Data sharing; Environmental exposure; Health policy; Engineering ethics; Medicine; Added value,Adductomics; Air pollution; Exposome; External exposome; Internal exposome; Policy; Statistics; Water contamination; Workshop report,Air Pollution/adverse effects; Biomedical Research; Congresses as Topic; Environmental Exposure/adverse effects; Environmental Health; Europe; Health Policy; Humans; Risk Assessment; Stakeholder Participation; Water Pollution/adverse effects,,World Health Organization (001) International; Medical Research Council (MR/L01341X/1) United Kingdom; EC FP7 (308610) International,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12889-018-5160-z.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29448939/ https://edoc.unibas.ch/61189/ http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/374980 https://lra.le.ac.uk/handle/2381/44642 https://acuresearchbank.acu.edu.au/item/8968v/exposomics-final-policy-workshop-and-stakeholder-consultation https://core.ac.uk/display/151191918 https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12889-018-5160-z http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/handle/2445/121080 http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/121080/1/turner2018_2928.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29448939 https://researchportal.phe.gov.uk/en/publications/exposomics-final-policy-workshop-and-stakeholder-consultation-dav http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5815236 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-018-5160-z https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F374980 https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-5160-z https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/35620 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5815236 https://core.ac.uk/download/158569689.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-5160-z,29448939,10.1186/s12889-018-5160-z,2790784065,PMC5815236,0,000-357-458-074-792; 001-592-004-196-61X; 002-249-834-378-955; 006-329-646-736-562; 006-669-247-149-134; 006-910-560-553-908; 007-050-392-459-670; 008-766-731-800-782; 010-768-856-238-675; 012-524-945-867-280; 013-300-261-481-807; 015-797-153-912-410; 016-768-372-746-161; 017-078-621-881-275; 017-405-375-841-707; 017-824-836-569-002; 018-863-263-562-652; 019-407-248-190-421; 020-487-624-585-32X; 021-608-684-521-402; 024-100-072-254-907; 027-574-694-016-317; 027-938-408-733-177; 030-803-551-652-281; 033-648-762-703-044; 035-750-188-749-040; 039-787-509-058-561; 040-589-535-177-300; 040-876-918-750-348; 041-974-579-810-929; 046-706-999-195-126; 046-974-608-611-665; 047-602-858-621-072; 047-919-653-672-760; 050-840-296-915-491; 051-632-080-563-941; 052-632-672-101-026; 052-973-662-924-147; 061-558-160-025-553; 062-692-807-278-820; 067-348-572-918-043; 071-615-621-937-67X; 072-042-364-654-214; 082-421-357-301-990; 083-154-677-494-472; 090-326-476-441-974; 097-913-930-822-656; 100-647-325-875-458; 102-795-287-639-004; 137-160-496-997-589; 137-651-420-153-351; 139-071-009-264-838; 142-244-186-122-655; 150-988-786-711-48X,22

White,"Purpose Binding proteins (G-proteins) mediate signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular functions and comprise Gα and Gβγ units. Human diseases have been reported for all five Gβ proteins. A de novo missense variant in GNB2 was recently reported in one individual with developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID) and dysmorphism. We aim to confirm GNB2 as a neurodevelopmental disease gene, and elucidate the GNB2-associated neurodevelopmental phenotype in a patient cohort. Methods We discovered a GNB2 variant in the index case via exome sequencing and sought individuals with GNB2 variants via international data-sharing initiatives. In silico modelling of the variants was assessed, along with multiple lines of evidence in keeping with American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines for interpretation of sequence variants. Results We identified 12 unrelated individuals with five de novo missense variants in GNB2, four of which are recurrent: p.(Ala73Thr), p.(Gly77Arg), p.(Lys89Glu) and p.(Lys89Thr). All individuals have DD/ID with variable dysmorphism and extraneurologic features. The variants are located at the universally conserved shared interface with the Gα subunit, which modelling suggests weaken this interaction. Conclusion Missense variants in GNB2 cause a congenital neurodevelopmental disorder with variable syndromic features, broadening the spectrum of multisystem phenotypes associated with variants in genes encoding G-proteins.",,,jmedgenet,2020-107462,Gene; Exome sequencing; Genomics; Human genome; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Genetics; Intellectual disability; Medical genetics; Missense mutation; Biology,G-beta protein; GNB2; developmental delay; intellectual disability,,,Autism Speaks; Health Innovation Challenge Fund; Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Program; Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital; Autism Sequencing Consortium; Australian Genomics Health Alliance PhD Award; Telethon Undiagnosed Diseases Program; Wellcome Trust; Undiagnosed Diseases Program - Victoria; Murdoch Children's Research Institute; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; National Human Genome Research Institute; National Human Genome Research Institute; Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship; National Institutes of Health; National Institutes of Health; National Health and Medical Research Council; Fondazione Telethon; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development; NIHR Biomedical Research Centre Oxford; Australian Genomic Health Alliance NHMRC Targeted Call for Research into Preparing Australia for the Genomics Revolution in Healthcare; Australian NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Neurocognitive Disorders,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34183358/ https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1184204 https://jmg.bmj.com/content/early/2021/08/01/jmedgenet-2020-107462 https://jmg.bmj.com/content/early/2021/06/28/jmedgenet-2020-107462 https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/publications/1184204 https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/133025 https://jmg.bmj.com/content/jmedgenet/early/2021/06/28/jmedgenet-2020-107462.full.pdf https://www.cmd.ox.ac.uk/publications/1184204 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1555828-recurrent-de-novo-missense-variants-in-gnb2-can-cause-syndromic-intellectual-disability.,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107462,34183358,10.1136/jmedgenet-2020-107462,3176647115,,0,004-797-177-282-039; 005-085-541-994-886; 008-263-024-747-850; 015-128-526-019-791; 023-147-297-425-262; 030-854-572-972-233; 039-535-161-446-887; 044-698-495-656-240; 045-535-621-031-250; 052-226-906-694-175; 056-942-789-620-873; 059-205-409-001-122; 064-811-270-322-415; 070-972-086-384-450; 072-318-773-202-408; 086-374-111-104-600; 096-092-966-018-561; 098-904-844-986-517,0

Smith,"We highlight improvements to the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) in the latest Release 3.0 (R3.0; covering 1662–2014). ICOADS is the most widely used freely available collection of surface marine observations, providing data for the construction of gridded analyses of sea surface temperature, estimates of air–sea interaction and other meteorological variables. ICOADS observations are assimilated into all major atmospheric, oceanic and coupled reanalyses, further widening its impact. R3.0 therefore includes changes designed to enable effective exchange of information describing data quality between ICOADS, reanalysis centres, data set developers, scientists and the public. These user-driven innovations include the assignment of a unique identifier (UID) to each marine report – to enable tracing of observations, linking with reports and improved data sharing. Other revisions and extensions of the ICOADS' International Maritime Meteorological Archive common data format incorporate new near-surface oceanographic data elements and cloud parameters. Many new input data sources have been assembled, and updates and improvements to existing data sources, or removal of erroneous data, made. Coupled with enhanced ‘preliminary’ monthly data and product extensions past 2014, R3.0 provides improved support of climate assessment and monitoring, reanalyses and near-real-time applications.",37,5,2211,2232,Unique identifier; Tracing; Meteorology; Data quality; Common Data Format; Data sharing; Environmental science; Climatology; Data set; Cloud computing; Metadata,,,,"Climate Observation Division, Climate Program Office, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce; US National Science Foundation through core funding at the National Center for Atmospheric Research; Joint DECC and Defra Integrated Climate Programme, DECC/Defra; NERC through the NOC National Capability Program; Economic and Social Research Council; Climate Observation Division of NOAA's Climate Program Office; U.S. National Science Foundation's Oceanographic Instrumentation and Technical Services Program",http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4775/full https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/articles:19864 https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4775 https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.4775 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.wiley-joc-v-37-i-5-joc4775 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/397480/ https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/14538 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4775 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017IJCli..37.2211F/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/joc.4775,,10.1002/joc.4775,2465808793,,0,001-853-093-423-767; 003-737-862-887-916; 009-838-875-872-044; 010-205-937-714-187; 011-625-956-834-763; 011-991-006-943-923; 014-946-409-961-444; 015-463-101-868-462; 018-891-135-480-255; 022-415-685-754-932; 022-780-982-274-420; 022-877-506-374-763; 027-144-106-980-098; 028-708-333-422-165; 029-165-960-347-756; 031-024-969-076-932; 032-061-997-327-339; 037-612-396-534-105; 043-298-997-779-348; 046-301-958-054-225; 047-192-714-905-536; 048-661-421-564-403; 050-749-311-698-994; 051-983-523-522-239; 055-004-805-365-343; 057-974-275-415-701; 058-465-290-925-84X; 058-855-734-044-917; 061-388-204-015-391; 061-978-121-060-63X; 062-053-262-398-476; 062-614-800-263-307; 063-163-380-473-389; 068-339-450-848-069; 070-590-793-590-604; 073-062-629-034-171; 075-614-628-774-237; 075-905-414-604-689; 078-563-228-609-373; 081-568-992-529-214; 083-941-803-995-183; 092-027-019-460-371; 092-907-200-434-106; 094-739-512-837-900; 096-509-467-713-544; 098-982-810-145-246; 099-021-845-399-725; 100-541-468-173-255; 102-653-959-421-080; 103-202-172-300-959; 103-395-853-608-40X; 108-450-923-167-373; 114-665-784-076-636; 120-830-629-883-765; 123-708-430-947-055; 126-665-376-864-321; 129-833-233-294-092; 136-225-764-788-811; 137-306-772-742-961; 143-666-786-978-154; 150-029-768-405-725; 152-080-614-259-24X; 163-537-132-344-069; 169-713-723-696-515; 182-894-423-120-377; 184-673-856-962-143; 185-670-814-516-535; 191-348-942-810-132; 191-633-565-129-095,183

Electronic monitoring devices have shown potential for improving inhaler use, yet little research has considered the attitudes of patients towards these devices. We gave seven adolescents with asthma an electronic monitoring device to use for one month and collected their views on important issues including monitoring and data sharing. Our results showed that participants felt positively about using the data to demonstrate responsibility for their condition to both their parents and medical professionals, but expressed concern for the attention the device’s appearance could draw to them and their asthma.

Small; Anita Attala; Keith Seymour; Sean Woodcock; Jonathan Ling,"There is an increasing presence of patient-led social media, mobile apps and patient support technology, but little is known about the role of these in the support of bariatric surgery patients in the UK. This study aimed to seek the views of allied health professionals (AHPs) working in bariatric surgical teams to understand their current perceptions of the role of social media, mobile apps and patient-support technology within bariatric surgery in the UK. A confidential, printed survey was distributed to the AHPs at the British Obesity and Metabolic Surgery Society (BOMSS) 7th Annual Scientific Conference in January 2016. An email to AHPs who did not attend the conference was sent requesting voluntary participation in the same survey online through Survey Monkey® within 2 weeks of the conference. A total of 95 responses were received, which was a 71% response rate (n = 134). Responses were from nurses (34%, n = 46), dietitians (32%, n = 32), psychologists (16%, n = 12) and 1 nutritionist, 1 physiotherapist, 1 patient advocate, 1 surgeon and 9 respondents did not fill in their title. The use of social media and mobile apps by patients is increasing, with AHPs concerned about misinformation; advice may differ from what is given in clinic. Technologies, e.g. telehealth and videoconferencing are not widely used in bariatric surgery in the UK. AHPs are unclear about the role of technologies for bariatric surgical patient support.

Chawner; Marina Mihaljevic; Sinead Morrison; Hale Yapici Eser; Anne M. Maillard; Beata Nowakowska; Marianne Bernadette van den Bree; Ann Swillen,"Background; ; Several rare copy number variants have been identified to confer risk for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD-CNVs), and increasingly NDD-CNVs are being identified in patients. There is a clinical need to understand the phenotypes of NDD-CNVs. However due to rarity of NDD-CNVs in the population, within individual countries there is a limited number of NDD-CNV carriers who can participate in research. The pan-european MINDDS (Maximizing Impact of Research in Neurodevelopmental Disorders) consortium was established in part to address this issue.; Methodology; ; A survey was developed to scope out the current landscape of NDD-CNV research across member countries of the MINDDS consortium, and to identify clinical cohorts with potential for future research.; Results; ; 36 centres from across 16 countries completed the survey. We provide a list of centres who can be contacted for future collaborations. 3844 NDD-CNV carriers were identified across clinical and research centres spanning a range of medical specialties, including psychiatry, paediatrics, medical genetics. A broad range of phenotypic data was available; including medical history, developmental history, family history and anthropometric data. In 12/16 countries, over 75% of NDD-CNV carriers could be recontacted for future studies.; Conclusion; ; This survey has highlighted the potential within Europe for large multi-centre studies of NDD-CNV carriers, to improve knowledge of the complex relationship between NDD-CNV and clinical phenotype. The MINNDS consortium is in a position to facilitate collaboration, data-sharing and knowledge exchange on NDD-CNV phenotypes across Europe.",63,12,104093,104093,Copy-number variation; Geography; Medical history; Family history; Population; In patient; Pan european; Family medicine; Medical genetics; Psychiatric genetics,Copy number variants; European; Medical genetics; Neurodevelopmental disorders; Psychiatric genetics; Research collaboration,"DNA Copy Number Variations; Databases, Genetic; Developmental Disabilities/diagnosis; Europe; Gene Frequency; Genetic Testing/methods; Genome-Wide Association Study/methods; Humans; Information Dissemination; Phenotype",,Medical Research Council (MR/L010305/1) United Kingdom,https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/136095/ https://orca.cf.ac.uk/136095/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33160096 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S176972122030803X https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160096 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33160096/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmg.2020.104093,33160096,10.1016/j.ejmg.2020.104093,3097123712,,0,001-224-159-079-961; 001-754-625-434-173; 001-869-448-766-993; 002-759-395-908-888; 004-275-785-244-644; 005-579-856-715-255; 006-178-053-331-249; 006-253-625-376-299; 010-121-236-714-530; 011-908-098-506-105; 015-217-995-332-670; 023-610-137-898-230; 024-006-172-469-517; 026-493-519-384-664; 026-524-588-142-633; 027-382-400-828-293; 030-254-354-544-688; 031-419-769-447-002; 033-234-708-544-919; 034-726-561-556-495; 034-918-087-685-99X; 036-730-765-927-723; 037-758-101-501-317; 039-751-497-733-413; 040-007-596-769-307; 041-073-280-320-96X; 043-806-546-767-573; 046-625-267-387-515; 048-566-251-689-776; 056-264-166-068-744; 056-471-969-119-690; 058-942-407-470-797; 058-950-561-843-782; 062-223-180-727-028; 065-741-024-402-888; 068-289-891-282-520; 072-934-812-933-123; 073-256-166-778-54X; 076-456-224-619-64X; 079-337-780-001-944; 079-787-538-197-836; 081-701-734-959-668; 090-021-911-389-502; 094-504-814-640-314; 096-149-262-788-140; 099-593-206-645-970; 099-620-636-680-996; 099-717-729-967-284; 112-593-015-773-565; 113-294-595-474-436; 144-720-592-370-440,0

Broad consent to such sharing is considered appropriate, feasible and acceptable in low- and middle-income settings, but to date limited empirical research has been conducted to inform the design of such processes. We examined stakeholder perspectives about how best to seek broad consent to sharing data from the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, which implemented a data sharing policy and broad consent to data sharing in January 2016. Between February and August 2017 qualitative data were collected at two sites, Bangkok and the Thai-Myanmar border town of Mae Sot. We conducted eighteen semi-structured interviews. We also conducted four focus group discussions with a total of nineteen people. Descriptive and thematic coding informed analysis of aspects of data sharing that are considered most important to inform participants about, and the best ways to explain complex and abstract topics relating to data sharing. The findings demonstrated that clinical trial participants prioritise information about the potential benefits and harms of data sharing. Stakeholders made multiple suggestions for clarifying information provided about data sharing on such topics. There was significant variation amongst stakeholders’ perspectives about how much information should be provided about data sharing, and it was clear that effective information provision should be responsive to the study, the study population, the individual research participant and the research context. Effectively communicating about data sharing with research participants is challenging in practice, highlighting the importance of robust and effective data sharing governance in this context. Broad consent should incorporate effective and efficient explanations of data sharing to promote informed decision-making, without impeding research participants’ understandings of key aspects of the research from which data will be shared. Further work is required to refine both the development of core information about data sharing to be provided to all research participants, and appropriate solutions for context specific-challenges arising when explaining data sharing.",19,1,86,86,Empirical research; Research ethics; Psychology; Qualitative research; Research participant; Data sharing; Context (language use); Public relations; Focus group; Thematic analysis,Broad consent; Data sharing; Research; Research ethics; Secondary use; Thailand,Adult; Biomedical Research/ethics; Clinical Trials as Topic/ethics; Female; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Informed Consent/ethics; Male; Multicenter Studies as Topic/ethics; Organizational Policy; Qualitative Research; Research Subjects; Thailand,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (096527) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (2013132/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (106698/Z/14/Z) United Kingdom,https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/940683 https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0326-x https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/940683 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12910-018-0326-x.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6223036 https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/940683 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30404642 https://www.tropmedres.ac/publications/940683 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-018-0326-x https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/940683 https://0-bmcmedethics-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/s12910-018-0326-x https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30404642/ https://www.weh.ox.ac.uk/publications/940683 https://philpapers.org/rec/CHECAW,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-018-0326-x,30404642,10.1186/s12910-018-0326-x,2899900567,PMC6223036,0,008-345-895-678-669; 010-938-575-860-707; 013-438-358-393-549; 015-053-505-151-458; 016-365-837-816-953; 016-425-722-679-911; 021-647-780-229-032; 023-097-073-292-349; 024-800-842-732-547; 025-568-732-580-901; 028-567-633-238-97X; 032-520-030-950-067; 033-706-344-295-941; 035-648-830-848-740; 036-312-661-618-588; 037-902-792-672-425; 039-231-507-973-180; 039-433-883-997-392; 041-351-846-842-204; 043-238-582-252-339; 043-813-119-071-745; 048-912-199-333-412; 053-609-575-603-914; 054-778-926-965-153; 060-711-673-569-152; 068-137-668-307-999; 069-666-005-621-303; 072-898-886-295-077; 075-465-734-221-082; 079-355-774-775-491; 085-600-704-194-468; 091-182-490-204-656; 098-422-711-641-097; 100-441-363-187-695; 124-707-160-725-322; 125-810-717-283-966; 132-706-574-496-06X; 135-302-870-468-483,7

Clinical trialists, particularly those receiving public funding, are often concerned about the additional time and money that data-sharing activities will require, but few published empirical data are available to help inform these decisions. We sought to evaluate the activity and resources required to prepare anonymised IPD from a clinical trial in anticipation of a future data-sharing request. Data from two UK publicly funded clinical trials were used for this exercise: 2437 participants with epilepsy recruited from 90 hospital outpatient clinics in the SANAD trial and 146 children with neuro-developmental problems recruited from 18 hospitals in the MENDS trial. We calculated the time and resources required to prepare each anonymised dataset and assemble a data pack ready for sharing. The older SANAD trial (published 2007) required 50 hours of staff time with a total estimated associated cost of £3185 whilst the more recently completed MENDS trial (published 2012) required 39.5 hours of staff time with total estimated associated cost of £2540. Clinical trial researchers, funders and sponsors should consider appropriate resourcing and allow reasonable time for preparing IPD ready for subsequent sharing. This process would be most efficient if prospectively built into the standard operational design and conduct of a clinical trial. Further empirical examples exploring the resource requirements in other settings is recommended. SANAD: International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Registry: ISRCTN38354748;  .

Kucharski; Andrew J. K. Conlan; Ken T. D. Eames,"School children are core groups in the transmission of many common infectious diseases, and are likely to play a key role in the spatial dispersal of disease across multiple scales. However, there is currently little detailed information about the spatial movements of this epidemiologically important age group. To address this knowledge gap, we collaborated with eight secondary schools to conduct a survey of movement patterns of school pupils in primary and secondary schools in the United Kingdom. We found evidence of a significant change in behaviour between term time and holidays, with term time weekdays characterised by predominately local movements, and holidays seeing much broader variation in travel patterns. Studies that use mathematical models to examine epidemic transmission and control often use adult commuting data as a proxy for population movements. We show that while these data share some features with the movement patterns reported by school children, there are some crucial differences between the movements of children and adult commuters during both term-time and holidays.",10,6,e0128070,,Proxy (climate); Seasonality; Demography; Pediatrics; Geography; Population; Age groups; Biological dispersal; Census,,Adult; Child; Holidays; Humans; Movement; Schools; Seasons; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Travel,,Medical Research Council (MR/K021524/1) United Kingdom,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0128070 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4452697 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1028070K/abstract https://paperity.org/p/72959832/schools-out-seasonal-variation-in-the-movement-patterns-of-school-children https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128070 https://datacompass.lshtm.ac.uk/150/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26030611 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/248679 https://core.ac.uk/download/42633141.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0128070,26030611,10.1371/journal.pone.0128070,646729331,PMC4452697,0,003-082-950-776-533; 006-874-209-190-964; 007-666-140-536-110; 008-482-109-233-963; 010-052-701-665-775; 015-333-133-944-890; 015-527-136-147-18X; 018-991-745-774-451; 019-235-524-028-095; 020-987-925-297-779; 026-194-096-627-141; 028-693-525-152-076; 040-573-340-687-03X; 041-345-059-449-576; 041-407-144-090-589; 056-756-032-731-097; 057-178-980-617-125; 057-586-071-243-253; 062-124-445-615-838; 066-586-073-738-176; 066-829-094-262-430; 075-299-143-829-028; 075-727-045-473-222; 075-852-365-682-827; 080-130-452-043-587; 088-521-327-788-757; 091-906-699-672-136; 098-948-589-324-368; 107-299-448-850-847; 109-540-939-966-415; 112-889-301-279-915; 118-303-475-083-514; 137-772-428-966-585; 153-847-868-142-786,16

Thomas; Jonathan Rushton; Salome A. Bukachi; Laura C. Falzon; Olivia Howland; Eric M. Fèvre,"Background: Collaboration between the human and animal health sectors, including the sharing of disease surveillance data, has the potential to improve public health outcomes through the rapid detection of zoonotic disease events prior to widespread transmission in humans. Kenya has been at the forefront of embracing a collaborative approach in Africa with the inception of the Zoonotic Disease Unit in 2011. Joint outbreak responses have been coordinated at the national level, yet little is currently documented on cross-sectoral collaboration at the sub-national level. Methods: Key informant interviews were conducted with 28 disease surveillance officers from the human and animal health sectors in three counties in western Kenya. An inductive process of thematic analysis was used to identify themes relating to barriers and drivers for cross-sectoral collaboration. Results: The study identified four interlinking themes related to drivers and barriers for cross-sectoral collaboration. To drive collaboration at the sub-national level there needs to be a clear identification of ""common objectives,"" as currently exemplified by the response to suspected rabies and anthrax cases and routine meat hygiene activities. The action of collaboration, be it integrated responses to outbreaks or communication and data sharing, require ""operational structures"" to facilitate them, including the formalisation of reporting lines, supporting legislation and the physical infrastructure, from lab equipment to mobile phones, to facilitate the activities. These structures in turn require ""appropriate resources"" to support them, which will be allocated based on the ""political will"" of those who control the resources. Conclusions: Ongoing collaborations between human and animal disease surveillance officers at the sub-national level were identified, driven by common objectives such as routine meat hygiene and response to suspected rabies and anthrax cases. In these areas a suitable operational structure is present, including a supportive legislative framework and clearly designated roles for officers within both sectors. There was support from disease surveillance officers to increase their collaboration, communication and data sharing across sectors, yet this is currently hindered by the lack of these formal operational structures and poor allocation of resources to disease surveillance. It was acknowledged that improving this resource allocation will require political will at the sub-national, national and international levels.",8,,658454,,Public health; Business; Disease surveillance; Legislation; Data sharing; One Health; Resource allocation; Public relations; Unit (housing); Thematic analysis,Kenya; livestock; one health; prioritisation; resource allocation; surveillance; zoonoses,,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/L019019/1) United Kingdom,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.658454/full https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34169106/ https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8217437 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8217437,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2021.658454,34169106,10.3389/fvets.2021.658454,3167911455,PMC8217437,0,008-290-600-774-608; 010-845-059-600-463; 014-438-952-187-269; 017-957-523-956-430; 021-100-348-412-20X; 022-626-159-440-159; 022-798-700-828-241; 025-873-515-494-75X; 026-714-347-709-472; 028-448-231-505-80X; 030-276-349-122-402; 042-077-630-130-934; 043-096-283-697-927; 046-065-403-141-753; 051-842-800-110-816; 054-060-313-651-79X; 066-071-437-703-335; 068-306-907-571-741; 073-739-702-999-677; 075-373-988-055-880; 086-587-883-230-761; 092-282-079-174-463; 097-254-205-066-986; 100-498-785-553-760; 105-899-934-817-336; 107-024-586-661-507; 120-452-379-778-456; 127-098-004-221-411; 130-096-157-113-285; 133-124-119-029-466; 142-426-526-834-382; 143-306-982-427-000; 155-706-363-231-71X; 171-551-340-975-974,0

Jones,"Background: The analysis of clinical free text from patient records for research has potential to contribute to the medical evidence base but access to clinical free text is frequently denied by data custodians who perceive that the privacy risks of data-sharing are too high. Engagement activities with patients and regulators, where views on the sharing of clinical free text data for research have been discussed, have identified that stakeholders would like to understand the potential clinical benefits that could be achieved if access to free text for clinical research were improved. We aimed to systematically review all UK research studies which used clinical free text and report direct or potential benefits to patients, synthesizing possible benefits into an easy to communicate taxonomy for public engagement and policy discussions.; ; Methods: We conducted a systematic search for articles which reported primary research using clinical free text, drawn from UK health record databases, which reported a benefit or potential benefit for patients, actionable in a clinical environment or health service, and not solely methods development or data quality improvement. We screened eligible papers and thematically analyzed information about clinical benefits reported in the paper to create a taxonomy of benefits.; ; Results: We identified 43 papers and derived five themes of benefits: health-care quality or services improvement, observational risk factor-outcome research, drug prescribing safety, case-finding for clinical trials, and development of clinical decision support. Five papers compared study quality with and without free text and found an improvement of accuracy when free text was included in analytical models.; ; Conclusions: Findings will help stakeholders weigh the potential benefits of free text research against perceived risks to patient privacy. The taxonomy can be used to aid public and policy discussions, and identified studies could form a public-facing repository which will help the health-care text analysis research community better communicate the impact of their work.",3,,606599,606599,Psychology; Medical record; Data governance; Public engagement; Observational study; Data quality; Primary research; Medical education; Clinical trial; Clinical decision support system,clinical free text; data governance; natural language processing; patient benefit; privacy; text analysis,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34713089 https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa56077/Download/56077__19302__2061b0171167486cb1010437031b24b2.pdf https://doaj.org/article/9d004ef18e334332897a3e2a833b1569 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2021.606599/full http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/97075/ https://cronfa.swansea.ac.uk/Record/cronfa56077 https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa56077 https://cronfa.swansea.ac.uk/Record/cronfa56077/Download/56077__19302__2061b0171167486cb1010437031b24b2.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.606599,34713089,10.3389/fdgth.2021.606599,3126293907,PMC8521813,0,000-793-800-668-344; 001-140-386-300-410; 002-511-211-381-219; 004-205-294-541-35X; 004-356-334-083-073; 005-132-850-927-766; 005-142-801-894-020; 006-453-404-587-208; 006-752-440-609-03X; 007-279-338-113-543; 007-476-340-416-036; 008-419-535-639-040; 009-187-570-329-546; 009-680-218-526-54X; 011-074-154-802-331; 011-658-011-432-74X; 012-277-508-841-570; 012-661-569-551-469; 013-541-969-076-695; 016-833-935-408-798; 020-373-859-445-473; 021-140-832-808-958; 021-576-782-263-685; 024-275-147-179-88X; 026-354-057-561-047; 026-828-800-490-436; 028-223-913-489-547; 028-293-866-288-235; 035-571-752-866-00X; 035-774-688-423-799; 039-150-761-373-426; 042-090-119-720-060; 042-451-611-939-348; 045-545-542-482-490; 046-452-178-272-211; 046-547-180-385-25X; 047-300-205-307-672; 047-872-377-854-051; 049-116-874-920-215; 049-511-442-669-311; 050-260-165-174-274; 051-491-914-614-682; 057-335-675-487-009; 059-372-220-510-466; 059-452-342-777-505; 061-533-167-577-456; 066-220-956-670-295; 070-768-933-728-237; 070-978-695-727-209; 072-168-954-099-074; 072-375-089-908-798; 074-658-827-969-414; 075-116-256-270-529; 075-782-420-958-646; 077-934-290-543-524; 078-120-144-030-441; 079-249-474-121-139; 079-421-634-267-711; 082-392-155-072-288; 086-038-379-763-436; 087-116-762-227-043; 091-149-640-545-831; 091-874-846-025-972; 092-307-154-336-37X; 093-508-280-881-00X; 096-110-157-975-86X; 097-232-258-842-339; 100-703-049-037-91X; 101-120-792-686-926; 103-615-191-446-246; 105-636-356-666-26X; 106-476-410-613-545; 107-167-132-725-068; 109-013-189-967-333; 115-334-288-945-310; 122-603-341-983-014; 128-161-709-442-076; 134-856-879-067-73X; 135-473-435-335-906; 135-917-948-980-024; 137-927-890-552-802; 138-332-935-017-269; 140-507-002-621-265; 145-588-473-240-935; 146-435-911-674-370; 153-811-109-368-878,0

Simultaneously the number of IPD meta-analyses (IPDMAs) is increasing. However, rates of data retrieval have not improved. Our goal was to describe the challenges of retrieving IPD for an IPDMA and provide practical guidance on obtaining and managing datasets based on a review of the literature and practical examples and observations. We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, until January 2019, to identify publications focused on strategies to obtain IPD. In addition, we searched pharmaceutical websites and contacted industry organizations for supplemental information pertaining to recent advances in industry policy and practice. Finally, we documented setbacks and solutions encountered while completing a comprehensive IPDMA and drew on previous experiences related to seeking and using IPD. Our scoping review identified 16 articles directly relevant for the conduct of IPDMAs. We present short descriptions of these articles alongside overviews of IPD sharing policies and procedures of pharmaceutical companies which display certification of Principles for Responsible Clinical Trial Data Sharing via Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations websites. Advances in data sharing policy and practice affected the way in which data is requested, obtained, stored and analyzed. For our IPDMA it took 6.5 years to collect and analyze relevant IPD and navigate additional administrative barriers. Delays in obtaining data were largely due to challenges in communication with study sponsors, frequent changes in data sharing policies of study sponsors, and the requirement for a diverse skillset related to research, administrative, statistical and legal issues. Knowledge of current data sharing practices and platforms as well as anticipation of necessary tasks and potential obstacles may reduce time and resources required for obtaining and managing data for an IPDMA. Sufficient project funding and timeline flexibility are pre-requisites for successful collection and analysis of IPD. IPDMA researchers must acknowledge the additional and unexpected responsibility they are placing on corresponding study authors or data sharing administrators and should offer assistance in readying data for sharing.",20,1,1,18,Data collection; Cochrane Library; Flexibility (personality); MEDLINE; Data sharing; Computer science; Timeline; Certification; Data retrieval; Knowledge management,Data collection; Data sharing; Individual participant data meta-analysis; Practical guide; Systematic review,Communication; Humans; Information Dissemination; Information Storage and Retrieval; Motivation; Research Personnel,,Medical Research Council (G0901530) United Kingdom; Marie Curie (MCCC-FCO-11-C) United Kingdom; CIHR (KRS 126594) Canada,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32398016/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7218569 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12874-020-00964-6 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12874-020-00964-6.pdf https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6923/v1.pdf?c=1585614140000 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6923/v1 https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-00964-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-00964-6,32398016,10.1186/s12874-020-00964-6,3027531952,PMC7218569,0,000-301-568-089-079; 001-124-777-187-494; 001-636-848-048-600; 002-054-851-581-525; 003-339-113-221-232; 003-501-820-945-195; 004-208-098-843-282; 004-289-562-148-61X; 004-430-080-135-357; 004-658-191-615-397; 004-927-101-042-867; 006-718-186-394-23X; 006-782-636-400-809; 007-242-464-566-106; 007-785-082-576-932; 009-277-508-042-519; 009-574-630-997-213; 009-751-887-782-941; 010-190-473-682-471; 011-097-447-532-517; 013-303-277-111-046; 014-960-977-747-519; 015-247-308-759-97X; 015-781-575-530-328; 015-899-382-015-577; 016-185-168-724-649; 016-365-837-816-953; 017-489-366-232-601; 019-071-865-081-339; 019-234-406-179-787; 019-299-734-208-775; 019-548-872-830-559; 019-925-449-412-393; 020-903-417-307-925; 021-331-587-795-138; 021-495-622-209-802; 021-925-215-428-423; 023-862-038-828-721; 023-940-965-035-432; 024-410-972-405-612; 026-205-597-910-501; 026-476-254-823-910; 026-795-122-242-282; 028-900-415-372-560; 028-989-959-754-042; 031-545-680-541-18X; 032-396-624-356-991; 032-465-306-782-828; 032-901-372-888-16X; 033-071-928-266-953; 035-906-153-525-395; 035-990-807-421-11X; 037-647-464-933-483; 037-747-200-525-783; 038-924-998-222-79X; 039-143-027-064-551; 039-309-388-213-812; 041-304-863-075-498; 043-754-919-265-460; 045-221-908-045-316; 045-316-522-580-916; 047-230-865-678-363; 047-990-797-111-454; 048-382-477-690-730; 049-180-495-796-169; 049-662-437-499-176; 049-733-386-429-762; 050-260-636-209-964; 051-640-603-936-269; 052-547-519-377-337; 053-474-155-799-521; 054-212-966-623-833; 056-081-717-689-810; 059-244-770-813-641; 059-423-762-050-211; 060-880-217-812-646; 062-524-439-483-616; 063-156-205-440-998; 063-516-447-514-722; 064-468-977-982-120; 065-065-438-457-896; 065-262-201-061-36X; 065-741-814-424-563; 066-932-298-584-445; 067-457-862-282-445; 067-481-268-141-412; 068-826-826-795-398; 071-369-296-418-911; 073-477-710-753-450; 075-204-677-494-600; 077-433-286-546-022; 078-351-299-808-869; 079-535-907-403-025; 082-306-912-987-52X; 085-320-250-288-390; 086-092-501-221-102; 086-470-411-539-657; 089-795-248-092-369; 090-340-799-629-921; 091-182-490-204-656; 091-787-990-345-342; 094-417-383-617-298; 097-653-390-900-554; 098-422-711-641-097; 098-727-591-914-595; 105-152-982-358-458; 109-180-353-268-218; 113-465-946-474-168; 114-948-154-474-20X; 115-501-377-123-058; 117-689-401-140-764; 117-847-857-173-119; 118-775-367-472-120; 119-543-511-508-778; 127-598-513-739-834; 127-932-384-251-162; 128-420-952-694-103; 130-521-601-804-31X; 132-031-476-844-582; 133-309-254-271-395; 135-302-870-468-483; 145-028-004-871-587; 156-256-401-071-608; 169-307-812-724-123; 177-729-381-638-505; 189-281-588-640-509,14

One such situation is the number of cyberattacks they may face when interacting online. This paper reports on an initiative which recruited, trained, and supported older adults to become community cybersecurity educators (CyberGuardians), tasked with promoting cybersecurity best practice within their communities to prevent older adults falling victim to opportunistic cyberattacks. This initiative utilised an embedded peer-to-peer information dissemination strategy, rather than expert-to-citizen, facilitating the inclusion of individuals who would ordinarily be unlikely to seek cybersecurity information and thus may be vulnerable to cyberattacks. We report on ways the CyberGuardians used informal methods to create more aware communities, served as role models for behaviour change and indirectly improved their personal wellbeing. We discuss considerations for supporting CyberGuardians, including implications for sustainability and for replicating this model in other digital contexts, e.g., recognising misinformation or improving mental health.",,,1,15,Mental health; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Best practice; Civic engagement; Information sharing; Misinformation; Information Dissemination; Computer security; Sustainability,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3411764.3445078 http://sure.sunderland.ac.uk/id/eprint/13499/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chi/chi2021.html#NicholsonMDHCM21 https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/training-and-embedding-cybersecurity-guardians-in-older-communiti https://doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445078,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445078,,10.1145/3411764.3445078,3161750441,,0,003-451-472-487-905; 005-305-255-134-967; 006-283-901-242-017; 006-460-010-131-852; 006-683-593-749-029; 010-829-625-718-328; 018-676-457-157-029; 022-922-004-762-248; 023-639-356-479-473; 023-687-635-946-982; 026-110-204-287-56X; 026-448-873-977-494; 029-061-160-435-110; 030-308-122-054-074; 030-859-827-289-050; 035-088-743-044-514; 035-856-246-755-744; 036-425-524-718-997; 041-517-467-195-905; 043-618-777-628-935; 057-153-866-134-946; 058-809-468-935-356; 060-245-357-993-407; 065-538-770-864-474; 069-866-463-946-806; 077-226-815-402-322; 081-940-633-390-327; 083-066-739-714-953; 084-074-063-793-757; 085-102-890-911-931; 094-527-745-685-261; 095-814-603-683-648; 095-847-724-219-471; 117-688-331-147-375; 120-827-236-109-19X; 143-857-541-478-68X; 147-823-177-701-864; 148-043-059-917-25X,2

Martin; Jenny L Donovan,"Opt-in consent is usually required for research, but is known to introduce selection bias. This is a particular problem for large scale epidemiological studies using only pre-collected health data. Most previous studies have shown that members of the public value opt-in consent and can perceive research without consent as an invasion of privacy. Past research has suggested that people are generally unaware of research processes and existing safeguards, and that education may increase the acceptability of research without prior informed consent, but this recommendation has not been formally evaluated. Our objectives were to determine the range of public opinion about the use of existing medical data for research and to explore views about consent to a secondary review of medical records for research. We also investigated the effect of the provision of detailed information about the potential effect of selection bias on public acceptability of the use of data for research. We carried out a systematic review of existing literature on public attitudes to secondary use of existing health records identified by searching PubMed (1966-present), Embase (1974-present) and reference lists of identified studies to provide a general overview, followed by a qualitative focus group study with 19 older men recruited from rural and suburban primary care practices in the UK to explore key issues in detail. The systematic review identified twenty-seven relevant papers and the findings suggested that males and older people were more likely to consent to a review of their medical data. Many studies noted participants’ lack of knowledge about research processes and existing safeguards and this was reflected in the focus groups. Focus group participants became more accepting of the use of pre-collected medical data without consent after being given information about selection bias and research processes. All participants were keen to contribute to NHS-related research but some were concerned about data-sharing for commercial gain and the potential misuse of information. Increasing public education about research and specific targeted information provision could promote trust in research processes and safeguards, which in turn could increase the acceptability of research without specific consent where the need for consent would lead to biased findings and impede research necessary to improve public health.",13,1,72,72,Health education; Public health; Secondary research; Qualitative research; Medical record; Selection bias; Medical education; Focus group; Informed consent; Medicine,,Aged; Biomedical Research/standards; Focus Groups; Health Education; Humans; Informed Consent; Male; Medical Records; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology; Public Opinion; Selection Bias; United Kingdom,,Medical Research Council (G0900871) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (C18281/A8145) United Kingdom; Department of Health United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (C18281/A11326) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (C18281/A15064) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (C11043/A4286) United Kingdom,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23734773 https://paperity.org/p/56934948/lets-get-the-best-quality-research-we-can-public-awareness-and-acceptance-of-consent-to https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1471-2288-13-72.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/81620857 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2288-13-72/fulltext.html https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2288-13-72 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2288-13-72 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/lets-get-the-best-quality-research-we-can-public-awareness-and-ac https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-13-72 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3682867 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23734773/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2288-13-72,23734773,10.1186/1471-2288-13-72,2021501736,PMC3682867,0,001-404-557-777-085; 002-063-463-265-162; 002-407-454-205-076; 002-617-065-873-068; 003-248-854-672-723; 004-971-320-303-906; 006-493-137-123-295; 006-705-788-701-521; 007-032-903-100-733; 014-995-185-832-395; 015-165-691-270-472; 019-144-001-711-844; 019-516-962-190-392; 023-957-645-271-533; 024-747-240-410-989; 026-008-847-475-651; 028-710-775-331-01X; 029-016-683-245-516; 031-534-722-786-692; 035-461-260-596-050; 037-622-957-634-253; 038-309-113-387-411; 046-520-601-387-799; 047-459-822-710-568; 050-825-875-007-011; 052-284-678-349-665; 052-592-174-062-104; 053-713-480-660-123; 054-815-469-206-441; 057-198-340-030-332; 059-504-875-873-104; 062-032-965-451-007; 064-427-460-494-086; 071-913-770-164-143; 079-850-234-263-768; 087-350-510-725-797; 088-578-456-285-870; 089-419-489-410-998; 089-559-693-765-838; 091-483-625-082-537; 109-348-264-226-856; 131-363-814-251-515; 132-079-070-024-229; 162-242-883-922-398; 185-679-940-561-653,86

It is theorized that the AI would position alcohol as 'heart healthy' to further undermine public perceptions of risks from drinking. Methods A comparative analysis (including content, thematic and context analyses) of cardiovascular health information published on the websites of AI-funded (n = 18, such as 'Drinkaware' and the 'Distilled Spirits Council of the US') and non-AI-funded (n = 18, such as 'NHS.uk') organizations based in multiple high-income jurisdictions. Results Websites of non-industry-funded health organizations were more likely than AI/SAPRO websites to label alcohol as a risk factor for a range of important cardiovascular diseases (such as myocardial infarction, congestive cardiac failure, hypertension and stroke). Conversely, AI/SAPRO websites were more likely to suggest alcohol was protective in the development of some heart conditions. AI/SAPRO websites frequently referenced the J-shaped curve as proof of benefit from moderate alcohol consumption; suggested a balance between the benefits and harms from drinking; positioned alcohol as consistent with a 'healthy lifestyle'; and framed drinking as a social norm. Conclusions AI-funded health organizations mis-represent the evidence on cardiovascular effects of moderate alcohol consumption. Healthcare professionals should appreciate the role of funding source in biasing content, and exercise caution when directing patients to content funded by the AI. Tighter regulation of messaging that AI/SAPRO's provide to the public is required, to avoid the dissemination of harmful misinformation.",31,6,1197,1204,Psychiatry; Psychology; Misinformation; MEDLINE; Context (language use); Alcohol industry; Cardiovascular health; Alcohol consumption; Health professionals; Risk factor (computing),,,,"Master's by Health Education England; Commonwealth Fund; National Institute for Health Research Doctoral Fellowship (NIHR300156); UK Prevention Research Partnership; UK Research and Innovation Research Councils: Medical Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council, and Natural Environment Research Council; British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK, Wellcome, and The Health Foundation; Scottish Government Chief Scientist Office, Health and Care Research Wales, National Institute of Health Research [NIHR], and Public Health Agency [NI]) (UKPRP_CO1_103)",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34480167/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckab135,34480167,10.1093/eurpub/ckab135,3197255565,,0,000-657-789-997-027; 013-553-703-858-372; 017-551-147-524-721; 024-122-156-548-416; 025-183-658-540-719; 027-570-948-356-293; 033-708-101-326-319; 037-550-015-414-716; 049-786-964-563-808; 059-722-499-618-77X; 063-123-673-904-65X; 073-203-453-131-272; 110-200-890-874-02X; 114-279-939-771-823,0

The Health Promotion in Schools of Music project in the USA and the Healthy Conservatoires project in the UK have therefore recommended health promotion at conservatoires. Few health education courses have been evaluated to date, however. A 5-month health education programme for first-year undergraduate students at a British conservatoire was introduced as part of the core curriculum in September 2016. The programme, which involved both lectures and seminars, was evaluated using quantitative and qualitative approaches. This article reports only the qualitative evaluation. Twenty semi-structured individual interviews were conducted either face-to-face or via Skype in April 2017. The data were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Five themes were identified: (i) the programme as a catalyst for engagement with health; (ii) behavioural changes; (iii) barriers to engaging with the programme material and initiating changes; (iv) suggestions for improvement; and (v) misinformation. Generally, participants viewed the programme as relevant and informative, particularly appreciating the intimate nature of the seminars. They reported that the programme helped them take a broader perspective on musicianship and that they would welcome sessions that are more practical than theoretical. They also reported instances of change in their behaviours relating to both lifestyle and management of music practice. In conclusion, undergraduate music students viewed this health education programme positively. Their feedback illustrates the complex nature of health promotion in the conservatoire setting.",,,,,Health education; Higher education; Industrial and organizational psychology; Psychology; Health promotion; Perspective (graphical); Misinformation; Core curriculum; Medical education; Musical,behaviour change; health promotion; music students; programme evaluation,,,"Musical Impact, a Conservatoires UK; UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council (AH/K002287/1)",https://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/id/eprint/46205/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daab146,34562098,10.1093/heapro/daab146,3200337584,,0,005-020-813-570-327; 006-428-146-936-756; 007-679-214-514-751; 008-514-870-525-927; 014-052-134-119-30X; 015-506-157-519-402; 017-648-607-980-850; 023-483-871-260-363; 024-957-849-379-307; 030-927-038-896-618; 031-140-150-948-251; 032-928-459-748-741; 034-624-890-796-759; 037-550-015-414-716; 038-569-361-723-817; 043-884-106-048-157; 046-109-908-231-596; 047-520-961-330-696; 048-093-176-443-698; 049-361-258-178-060; 064-170-998-861-238; 068-506-680-324-223; 082-367-901-969-368; 085-179-743-004-720; 092-766-882-881-002; 097-859-298-619-528; 102-737-526-477-271; 103-548-235-527-295; 120-618-504-752-958; 147-974-218-501-809; 148-632-311-126-229; 162-118-502-591-428,1

In India, only 7.3% of its 365 million youth report such problems. Although public stigma associated with mental health problems particularly affects help-seeking among young people, the extent of stigma among young people in India is unknown. Describing and characterizing public stigma among young people will inform targeted interventions to address such stigma in India, and globally. Thus, we examined the magnitude and manifestations of public stigma, and synthesised evidence of recommendations to reduce mental-health-related stigma among young people in India. A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies was conducted. Nine electronic databases were searched and 30 studies (n = 6767) met inclusion criteria. Most studies (66%) focused on youth training to become health professionals. One-third of young people display poor knowledge of mental health problems and negative attitudes towards people with mental health problems and one in five had actual/intended stigmatizing behavior (I2>=95%). Young people are unable to recognize causes and symptoms of mental health problems and believe that recovery is unlikely. People with mental health problems are perceived as dangerous and irresponsible, likely due to misinformation and misunderstanding of mental health problems as being solely comprised of severe mental disorders (e.g. schizophrenia). However, psychiatric labels are not commonly used/understood. Public education may use symptomatic vignettes (through relatable language and visuals) instead of psychiatric labels to improve young people’s understanding of the range of mental health problems. Recommended strategies to reduce public stigma include awareness campaigns integrated with educational institutions and content relevant to culture and age-appropriate social roles.",20,1,538,538,Psychiatry; Mental health; Psychology; Stigma (botany); Observational study; Misinformation; Public education; Targeted interventions; Inclusion (disability rights); Schizophrenia,India; Mental health; Stigma; Systematic review; Youth,Adolescent; Humans; India; Mental Disorders/epidemiology; Mental Health; Schizophrenia; Social Stigma,,Wellcome Trust (084754/Z/08/Z) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-020-02937-x/peer-review https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7667785 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12888-020-02937-x.pdf https://link.springer.com/10.1186/s12888-020-02937-x https://doaj.org/article/28abb82db6a5445db2c839db10b5f876 https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-020-02937-x https://paperity.org/p/258431156/stigma-associated-with-mental-health-problems-among-young-people-in-india-a-systematic https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33198678/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667785,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02937-x,33198678,10.1186/s12888-020-02937-x,3105303626,PMC7667785,0,000-808-649-752-242; 001-356-351-460-61X; 001-436-643-410-745; 001-599-886-543-872; 002-735-129-644-254; 004-641-656-699-834; 005-457-670-111-984; 006-411-505-905-716; 007-337-819-096-978; 007-340-876-375-364; 008-122-727-773-589; 009-258-059-151-176; 009-875-714-699-909; 009-876-265-452-699; 010-767-922-209-748; 010-810-206-220-920; 011-116-232-027-346; 012-586-165-497-542; 013-355-369-120-729; 017-300-737-144-757; 017-756-337-634-63X; 018-239-684-465-923; 019-139-464-121-22X; 019-883-789-021-329; 019-905-270-729-018; 021-594-729-975-914; 023-915-820-950-643; 024-210-669-857-310; 026-020-689-548-940; 026-124-401-689-186; 031-351-722-590-153; 032-326-830-380-665; 034-187-360-207-432; 034-265-723-507-065; 035-318-552-165-787; 036-029-330-716-569; 036-793-834-055-673; 037-808-915-813-662; 038-960-834-672-514; 040-320-368-948-371; 042-724-627-449-336; 043-530-927-329-273; 045-848-582-479-681; 046-583-821-174-427; 046-963-296-569-889; 048-966-524-016-335; 051-497-706-514-916; 052-034-456-359-604; 053-690-914-502-407; 055-787-840-920-166; 055-788-063-462-184; 056-461-898-691-059; 057-989-579-252-333; 058-068-059-206-616; 059-296-291-285-620; 062-221-249-046-599; 064-347-305-198-340; 065-414-409-956-293; 067-623-482-804-011; 067-688-094-501-518; 068-745-449-587-475; 069-256-628-867-746; 070-943-640-802-072; 074-330-059-856-054; 075-344-434-034-073; 077-503-516-546-345; 081-423-590-652-642; 082-491-378-093-514; 083-876-609-529-973; 086-586-581-991-456; 088-449-014-465-654; 088-604-276-304-022; 090-397-328-043-497; 090-621-441-470-937; 090-984-179-110-508; 091-059-357-915-236; 094-269-459-627-651; 097-360-976-307-062; 100-373-029-036-873; 101-269-273-984-783; 104-086-738-170-366; 105-218-847-962-678; 105-897-378-662-839; 107-744-695-289-535; 109-273-148-276-246; 109-675-847-509-856; 112-723-840-654-77X; 115-431-584-279-847; 117-953-602-934-173; 119-012-786-773-391; 119-459-204-750-693; 120-695-285-554-095; 122-717-302-385-72X; 123-346-119-469-307; 125-138-802-503-254; 133-727-831-590-460; 139-422-204-313-73X; 140-037-504-110-04X; 142-382-572-880-353; 145-847-240-300-507; 149-127-618-687-636; 151-984-497-409-872; 153-416-018-625-971; 168-553-881-128-832; 183-420-184-777-807; 183-645-480-585-735; 188-235-211-033-633; 193-642-506-736-570,9

This study used in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 48 stakeholders in Vietnam to explore the experiences, attitudes, and expectations that inform ethical and effective approaches to sharing clinical research data.

Asselbergs; John Danesh; Richard Dobson; Nikolaos Maniadakis; Aldo P. Maggioni; Ghislaine J. M. W. van Thiel; Maureen Cronin; Gunnar Brobert; Panos Vardas; Stefan D. Anker; Diederick E. Grobbee; Spiros Denaxas,"Aims Cohorts of millions of people's health records, whole genome sequencing, imaging, sensor, societal and publicly available data present a rapidly expanding digital trace of health. We aimed to critically review, for the first time, the challenges and potential of big data across early and late stages of translational cardiovascular disease research. Methods and results We sought exemplars based on literature reviews and expertise across the BigData@Heart Consortium. We identified formidable challenges including: data quality, knowing what data exist, the legal and ethical framework for their use, data sharing, building and maintaining public trust, developing standards for defining disease, developing tools for scalable, replicable science and equipping the clinical and scientific work force with new inter-disciplinary skills. Opportunities claimed for big health record data include: richer profiles of health and disease from birth to death and from the molecular to the societal scale; accelerated understanding of disease causation and progression, discovery of new mechanisms and treatment-relevant disease sub-phenotypes, understanding health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems and returning actionable feedback loops to improve (and potentially disrupt) existing models of research and care, with greater efficiency. In early translational research we identified exemplars including: discovery of fundamental biological processes e.g. linking exome sequences to lifelong electronic health records (EHR) (e.g. human knockout experiments); drug development: genomic approaches to drug target validation; precision medicine: e.g. DNA integrated into hospital EHR for pre-emptive pharmacogenomics. In late translational research we identified exemplars including: learning health systems with outcome trials integrated into clinical care; citizen driven health with 24/7 multi-parameter patient monitoring to improve outcomes and population-based linkages of multiple EHR sources for higher resolution clinical epidemiology and public health. Conclusion High volumes of inherently diverse ('big') EHR data are beginning to disrupt the nature of cardiovascular research and care. Such big data have the potential to improve our understanding of disease causation and classification relevant for early translation and to contribute actionable analytics to improve health and healthcare.",39,16,1481,1495,Translational research; Public health; Health informatics; Health care; Precision medicine; Data science; Population; Medicine; Big data; Analytics,,"Big Data; Cardiovascular Diseases/diagnosis; Electronic Health Records/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Translational Research, Biomedical/methods",,British Heart Foundation (RG/08/014/24067) United Kingdom; Department of Health (CDF-2015-08-074) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L003120/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K006584/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/16/1481/4096831 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F371460 http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10042324/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29370377/ http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29370377 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019015 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/278553 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1185112 https://doi.org/10.1093%2Feurheartj%2Fehx487 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6019015 http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/371460,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehx487,29370377,10.1093/eurheartj/ehx487,2790916396,PMC6019015,0,000-393-041-064-722; 000-970-252-625-70X; 001-005-665-668-822; 001-913-247-641-751; 002-114-537-772-042; 002-446-877-820-830; 002-767-777-698-417; 002-864-394-030-406; 003-562-014-527-369; 004-248-309-859-708; 005-299-545-998-239; 006-189-649-732-047; 006-869-754-767-099; 007-360-700-193-565; 008-892-955-372-163; 010-222-991-684-139; 010-456-847-549-559; 011-597-520-810-845; 012-918-264-608-066; 013-844-168-011-267; 015-023-041-112-196; 015-150-379-939-328; 015-359-715-368-606; 015-788-700-177-781; 016-013-169-897-508; 016-144-348-745-315; 016-762-220-821-719; 017-965-231-000-971; 017-971-864-494-992; 018-399-041-364-961; 018-537-798-155-785; 019-381-850-574-505; 019-458-314-869-29X; 019-583-853-520-161; 019-759-686-568-374; 020-174-844-068-896; 020-283-868-252-690; 021-093-543-057-079; 021-226-939-451-562; 021-275-717-859-766; 021-672-808-234-867; 021-880-294-823-766; 022-566-662-716-042; 023-370-757-601-24X; 023-392-800-466-176; 023-446-974-754-304; 023-748-015-952-632; 023-779-146-782-110; 024-849-701-774-062; 026-029-956-795-964; 026-061-343-908-241; 026-419-799-073-776; 027-475-728-172-956; 028-957-143-755-054; 029-877-239-393-904; 030-707-179-053-468; 032-812-489-885-128; 032-898-192-053-603; 032-939-464-940-862; 033-640-741-658-487; 034-394-654-049-005; 035-551-503-973-009; 037-889-910-411-186; 038-812-488-966-725; 039-981-116-965-717; 040-544-803-168-349; 042-153-192-005-421; 042-455-930-023-909; 043-067-166-116-246; 044-941-978-398-933; 045-386-275-438-800; 046-202-562-656-20X; 046-718-041-032-044; 047-268-989-306-629; 048-525-173-870-228; 048-831-053-033-068; 049-595-703-273-157; 050-128-851-105-369; 050-990-530-651-281; 051-504-974-050-081; 054-193-948-380-769; 055-519-837-857-388; 056-167-421-656-443; 056-568-578-822-494; 056-968-929-262-664; 057-216-354-098-000; 058-797-985-966-139; 059-280-544-856-836; 061-220-015-569-45X; 061-918-980-788-990; 062-740-099-067-478; 064-381-296-096-244; 064-454-561-106-699; 064-852-801-879-513; 065-000-186-527-896; 065-046-318-160-963; 065-808-874-001-646; 066-381-745-711-998; 068-091-759-254-123; 069-405-622-489-787; 070-769-113-811-494; 070-842-381-547-800; 071-069-417-173-355; 073-072-285-018-627; 073-171-079-925-684; 073-376-826-664-713; 075-208-803-697-782; 075-802-822-545-356; 078-044-638-112-883; 078-692-899-377-391; 079-137-793-871-512; 080-775-957-349-096; 080-984-191-906-995; 081-389-384-400-085; 081-552-643-034-153; 084-466-158-396-95X; 084-620-046-612-577; 085-274-778-016-065; 085-416-095-530-007; 088-211-965-882-381; 092-068-822-606-406; 093-931-530-069-232; 094-951-512-261-33X; 095-889-372-020-607; 096-983-401-605-231; 099-423-206-946-43X; 100-691-245-682-435; 107-353-989-345-266; 109-041-235-734-898; 110-276-917-575-531; 114-396-443-383-942; 114-763-289-696-773; 118-197-078-558-364; 122-407-567-198-707; 129-172-287-808-698; 137-738-351-002-577; 140-922-756-183-044; 141-598-988-118-158; 144-462-201-569-788; 162-725-859-796-180; 170-044-215-797-07X,112

Willemze,"BACKGROUND: Survival in mycosis fungoides (MF) is varied and may be poor. The PROCLIPI (PROspective Cutaneous Lymphoma International Prognostic Index) study is a web-based data collection system for early-stage MF with legal data-sharing agreements permitting international collaboration in a rare cancer with complex pathology. Clinicopathological data must be 100% complete and in-built intelligence in the database system ensures accurate staging. OBJECTIVES: To develop a prognostic index for MF. METHODS: Predefined datasets for clinical, haematological, radiological, immunohistochemical, genotypic, treatment and quality of life are collected at first diagnosis of MF and annually to test against survival. Biobanked tissue samples are recorded within a Federated Biobank for translational studies. RESULTS: In total, 430 patients were enrolled from 29 centres in 15 countries spanning five continents. Altogether, 348 were confirmed as having early-stage MF at central review. The majority had classical MF (81·6%) with a CD4 phenotype (88·2%). Folliculotropic MF was diagnosed in 17·8%. Most presented with stage I (IA: 49·4%; IB: 42·8%), but 7·8% presented with enlarged lymph nodes (stage IIA). A diagnostic delay between first symptom development and initial diagnosis was frequent [85·6%; median delay 36 months (interquartile range 12-90)]. This highlights the difficulties in accurate diagnosis, which includes lack of a singular diagnostic test for MF. CONCLUSIONS: This confirmed early-stage MF cohort is being followed-up to identify prognostic factors, which may allow better management and improve survival by identifying patients at risk of disease progression. This study design is a useful model for collaboration in other rare diseases, especially where pathological diagnosis can be complex.",181,2,350,357,Quality of life; Interquartile range; Internal medicine; Stage (cooking); Prospective cohort study; Mycosis fungoides; International Prognostic Index; Cutaneous lymphoma; Medicine; Cohort,,Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Datasets as Topic; Delayed Diagnosis/statistics & numerical data; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; International Cooperation; Male; Middle Aged; Mycosis Fungoides/diagnosis; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Registries/statistics & numerical data; Risk Factors; Skin/pathology; Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis,,Cancer Research UK (50763/A18021) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30267549 https://iris.unito.it/handle/2318/1717359 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjd.17258 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1360575-the-proclipi-international-registry-of-early-stage-mycosis-fungoides-identifies-substantial-diagnostic-delay-in-most-patients https://cris.unibo.it/handle/11585/674410 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30267549/ https://iris.unipv.it/handle/11571/1246270 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjd.17258 http://www.repository.uhblibrary.co.uk/id/eprint/3813/ https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/159987/ https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/284857,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.17258,30267549,10.1111/bjd.17258,2893877319,,0,000-141-617-559-373; 002-217-117-859-696; 004-224-212-158-626; 005-231-901-712-874; 013-511-722-645-668; 013-693-791-633-767; 013-929-329-972-935; 014-769-256-124-738; 014-887-957-688-066; 015-722-808-276-106; 017-282-776-893-674; 017-431-867-455-422; 018-122-092-193-427; 021-032-482-923-463; 030-587-546-496-129; 031-555-956-126-382; 033-008-621-938-274; 042-678-945-998-977; 051-185-492-715-006; 057-380-261-257-724; 057-508-930-541-862; 058-155-611-172-508; 061-805-034-333-235; 062-610-871-829-605; 064-655-922-614-463; 068-049-047-405-860; 074-401-629-887-369; 078-691-730-994-533; 078-734-487-549-866; 086-349-995-362-407; 097-081-206-955-109; 097-382-269-398-943; 099-328-371-512-883; 117-085-568-178-900; 117-372-014-907-990; 136-881-940-785-501,69

Weiss,"We refer to the measures proposed by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) requiring early sharing of data after trial publication (Jan 23, p e9). We welcome the move towards greater sharing of trial data but have concerns about unintended consequences of the proposal, particularly for community-based trials in low-income and middle-income countries. Our main concern is the short (6 month) period proposed before data must be shared. Our studies often take many years of intensive fi eldwork before primary results are available. Published output during a trial is often limited to maintain blinding, and researchers’ careers are crucially dependent on post-trial outputs. The research team will focus its effort on presenting primary findings as soon as possible, especially when these are of major policy relevance. Following this, there will usually be a series of pre-planned further analyses. These trials, often involving many thousands of participants, are generally done by collaborative teams, including scientists from institutions in which research capacity is being built. Junior researchers from these institutions will often be responsible for preparing secondary trial outputs, which is very important for their career development. If data are shared openly within 6 months of the primary publication, other groups (eg, from well resourced centres in high-income countries) might easily outpace the work of these scientists, further exacerbating the asymmetry of opportunities between researchers in high-income countries and those in lowincome and middle-income countries. These concerns would be reduced if a 12 month period of exclusive use were adopted. This could be a proportionate arrangement that protects the legitimate interests of researchers while ensuring that data can be shared without undue delay. If the main concern of the ICMJE is the transparency of fi ndings and the ability to do replication analyses to check that data have been correctly analysed and reported, our opinion is that this could be ensured in other ways. For example, investigators could be required to share the data for replication analyses on a confi dential basis at an earlier stage. Those advocating for greater data sharing correctly point out that researchers doing trials have a duty to study participants to maximise the value of the data they have voluntarily provided. But it is important to ensure that the proposed requirements do not make it so unattractive and unrewarding for researchers to do challenging long-term primary research that such studies are not done. This would be a grave disservice to the public.",387,10035,2287,2287,Psychology; Blinding; Unintended consequences; Primary research; Career development; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Public relations; Clinical trial; Transparency (graphic),,Advisory Committees; Clinical Trials as Topic; Editorial Policies; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods,,Medical Research Council (G0901756) United Kingdom,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616306821 https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(16)30683-3.pdf https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2816%2930682-1/fulltext https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27302259 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673616306821 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/2551433/ http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(16)30683-3.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(16)30682-1,27302259,10.1016/s0140-6736(16)30682-1,2416467918,,0,015-227-688-423-184,11

Wilson; Marten Winter; Piero Genovesi; Melodie A. McGeoch,"Managing biological invasions relies on good global coverage of species distributions. Accurate information on alien species distributions, obtained from international policy and cross-border co-operation, is required to evaluate trans-boundary and trading partnership risks. However, a standardized approach for systematically monitoring alien species and tracking biological invasions is still lacking. This Perspective presents a vision for global observation and monitoring of biological invasions. We show how the architecture for tracking biological invasions is provided by a minimum information set of Essential Variables, global collaboration on data sharing and infrastructure, and strategic contributions by countries. We show how this novel, synthetic approach to an observation system for alien species provides a tangible and attainable solution to delivering the information needed to slow the rate of new incursions and reduce the impacts of invaders. We identify three Essential Variables for Invasion Monitoring; alien species occurrence, species alien status and alien species impact. We outline how delivery of this minimum information set by joint, complementary contributions from countries and global community initiatives is possible. Country contributions are made feasible using a modular approach where all countries are able to participate and strategically build their contributions to a global information set over time. The vision we outline will deliver wide-ranging benefits to countries and international efforts to slow the rate of biological invasions and minimize their environmental impacts. These benefits will accrue over time as global coverage and information on alien species increases.",213,,295,308,Environmental resource management; Species distribution; Set (psychology); Alien; Standardized approach; Data sharing; Alien species; General partnership; Biology; Information set,,,,"Australian Research Council; Centre of Excellence PLADIAS; The Czech Academy of Sciences; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; BiodivERsA; Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT/MCTES); POPH/FSE (EC); National Research Foundation of South Africa; National Research Foundation of South Africa; South African National Department of Environment Affairs; DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology; Natural Environment Research Council; Joint Nature Conservation Committee; COST Action; DST-NRF Centre of Excellence for Invasion Biology, the National Research Foundation of South Africa; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716302373 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1503632/ https://core.ac.uk/display/76971439 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/2d3b4deb-530b-3885-b245-866514420abc/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320716302373 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/a-vision-for-global-monitoring-of-biological-invasions http://opus.sanbi.org:80/handle/20.500.12143/5512 https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/a-vision-for-global-monitoring-of-biological-invasions https://scholar.sun.ac.za:443/handle/10019.1/117621 https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/26412 https://core.ac.uk/download/76971439.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2016.06.013,,10.1016/j.biocon.2016.06.013,2461256145,,0,000-009-016-781-659; 002-120-778-597-434; 003-541-769-850-890; 005-076-442-022-147; 005-331-876-286-153; 006-189-037-410-469; 009-462-637-067-688; 011-921-850-928-186; 012-004-435-922-383; 012-291-170-531-583; 013-535-210-465-141; 014-841-719-889-635; 016-041-572-894-807; 017-059-351-754-511; 017-258-720-896-593; 019-539-764-242-376; 024-220-465-821-286; 027-123-528-514-06X; 030-157-936-392-405; 033-394-194-083-790; 034-708-596-544-858; 038-026-427-199-878; 038-576-531-136-734; 043-544-360-093-462; 043-664-757-448-133; 048-257-233-682-037; 051-374-473-154-39X; 056-966-609-020-886; 058-006-808-740-477; 058-850-235-670-54X; 058-893-886-507-13X; 068-028-107-874-835; 068-033-450-354-753; 068-040-313-337-282; 068-242-633-535-371; 068-654-894-445-105; 076-105-094-695-139; 080-512-384-707-76X; 080-805-037-579-280; 085-007-782-094-000; 089-022-553-859-955; 089-908-105-656-76X; 093-716-749-045-989; 094-956-305-298-909; 106-895-914-258-731; 109-215-995-500-426; 110-669-716-908-923; 128-170-841-709-836; 133-549-988-434-408; 135-930-299-400-961; 139-311-798-867-649; 151-977-055-572-378; 185-668-351-219-303,124

Rhon; Kim L Bennell; Edward Roddy; Carl Heneghan; David J Beard; Jonathan Rees; Richard D Riley,"Shoulder pain is one of the most common presentations of musculoskeletal pain with a 1-month population prevalence of between 7 and 26%. The overall prognosis of shoulder pain is highly variable with 40% of patients reporting persistent pain 1 year after consulting their primary care clinician. Despite evidence for prognostic value of a range of patient and disease characteristics, it is not clear whether these factors also predict (moderate) the effect of specific treatments (such as corticosteroid injection, exercise, or surgery). This study aims to identify predictors of treatment effect (i.e. treatment moderators or effect modifiers) by investigating the association between a number of pre-defined individual-level factors and the effects of commonly used treatments on shoulder pain and disability outcomes. This will be a meta-analysis using individual participant data (IPD). Eligible trials investigating the effectiveness of advice and analgesics, corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy-led exercise, psychological interventions, and/or surgical treatment in patients with shoulder conditions will be identified from systematic reviews and an updated systematic search for trials, and risk of bias will be assessed. Authors of all eligible trials will be approached for data sharing. Outcomes measured will be shoulder pain and disability, and our previous work has identified candidate predictors. The main analysis will be conducted using hierarchical one-stage IPD meta-analysis models, examining the effect of treatment-predictor interaction on outcome for each of the candidate predictors and describing relevant subgroup effects where significant interaction effects are detected. Random effects will be used to account for clustering and heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses will be based on (i) exclusion of trials at high risk of bias, (ii) use of restricted cubic splines to model potential non-linear associations for candidate predictors measured on a continuous scale, and (iii) the use of a two-stage IPD meta-analysis framework. Our study will collate, appraise, and synthesise IPD from multiple studies to examine potential predictors of treatment effect in order to assess the potential for better and more efficient targeting of specific treatments for individuals with shoulder pain.

Jorge Cardoso; Frederik Barkhof,"Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have heterogeneous clinical presentations, symptoms, and progression over time, making MS difficult to assess and comprehend in vivo. The combination of large-scale data sharing and artificial intelligence creates new opportunities for monitoring and understanding MS using MRI. First, development of validated MS-specific image analysis methods can be boosted by verified reference, test, and benchmark imaging data. Using detailed expert annotations, artificial intelligence algorithms can be trained on such MS-specific data. Second, understanding disease processes could be greatly advanced through shared data of large MS cohorts with clinical, demographic, and treatment information. Relevant patterns in such data that may be imperceptible to a human observer could be detected through artificial intelligence techniques. This applies from image analysis (lesions, atrophy, or functional network changes) to large multidomain datasets (imaging, cognition, clinical disability, genetics). After reviewing data sharing and artificial intelligence, we highlight 3 areas that offer strong opportunities for making advances in the next few years: crowdsourcing, personal data protection, and organized analysis challenges. Difficulties as well as specific recommendations to overcome them are discussed, in order to best leverage data sharing and artificial intelligence to improve image analysis, imaging, and the understanding of MS.",97,21,989,999,Benchmark (computing); Leverage (statistics); Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Data sharing; Functional networks; Large scale data; Computer science; Crowdsourcing; Data Protection Act 1998,,,,Wellcome Trust (215573/Z/19/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (203139/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT203148/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT213038/Z/18/Z) United Kingdom,https://n.neurology.org/content/97/21/989 http://n.neurology.org/content/97/21/989 https://n.neurology.org/content/neurology/early/2021/10/04/WNL.0000000000012884.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000012884,34607924,10.1212/wnl.0000000000012884,3204942238,PMC8610621,0,000-701-590-973-664; 001-731-626-836-105; 001-900-370-730-191; 004-146-633-868-713; 005-048-256-981-071; 005-349-098-372-412; 007-599-558-840-008; 010-372-815-635-227; 012-139-988-100-724; 013-063-200-214-530; 013-279-506-580-261; 013-637-875-470-161; 016-043-526-509-508; 016-870-810-885-358; 017-453-800-978-63X; 017-583-665-097-914; 017-840-061-587-773; 018-942-530-132-784; 021-119-878-683-744; 021-338-107-995-74X; 021-614-490-700-550; 022-918-045-792-249; 023-313-374-209-362; 024-944-117-710-823; 026-319-886-695-823; 028-149-420-362-772; 028-696-653-010-949; 029-144-558-151-189; 029-735-374-411-243; 035-056-810-105-510; 035-700-795-573-66X; 046-019-657-946-925; 046-553-974-573-042; 049-145-663-892-931; 057-793-547-662-042; 060-460-496-049-274; 065-828-282-675-32X; 070-007-397-506-297; 070-635-452-143-247; 070-854-322-147-469; 074-717-425-130-082; 078-929-311-149-930; 078-989-142-286-049; 079-243-524-744-565; 079-908-918-303-264; 083-723-000-152-451; 090-121-047-250-329; 096-136-404-914-841; 096-499-045-763-780; 097-145-856-126-513; 099-873-629-631-665; 102-777-870-192-255; 114-677-885-428-811; 117-669-730-994-586; 118-723-152-502-551; 121-295-323-348-860; 121-707-574-802-675; 122-041-200-251-029; 135-913-744-588-786; 138-372-131-360-834; 145-620-068-187-322; 175-213-835-754-587; 183-670-015-592-23X,1

Day; Iacopo Olivotto; Carolyn Y. Ho; Euan A. Ashley; Eric M. Green; Colleen Caleshu,"Background— Clinically impactful differences in the interpretation of genetic test results occur between laboratories and clinicians. To improve the classification of variants, a better understanding of why discrepancies occur and how they can be reduced is needed. Methods and Results— We examined the frequency, causes, and resolution of discordant variant classifications in the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), a consortium of international centers with expertise in the clinical management and genetic architecture of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Of the 112 variants present in patients at >1 center, 23 had discordant classifications among centers (20.5%; Fleiss κ, 0.54). Discordance was more than twice as frequent among clinical laboratories in ClinVar, a public archive of variant classifications (315/695 variants; 45.2%; Fleiss κ, 0.30; P Conclusions— Discordance in variant classification among hypertrophic cardiomyopathy centers is largely attributable to privately held data. Some discrepancies are caused by differences in expert assessment of conflicting data. Discordance was markedly lower among centers specialized in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than among clinical laboratories, suggesting that optimal genetic test interpretation occurs in the context of clinical care delivered by specialized centers with both clinical and genetics expertise.",10,5,0,0,Internal medicine; Cardiomyopathy; Data sharing; Context (language use); Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; Genetic testing; Test interpretation; Medicine; Genetic counseling; Genetic architecture,"cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic; genetic counseling; genetic testing; registries","Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic/epidemiology; Female; Genetic Testing; Genetic Variation; Hospitals, Special; Humans; Information Dissemination; Male; Registries",,Medical Research Council (MC_UP_1102/20) United Kingdom,https://flore.unifi.it/handle/2158/1181097 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28986452 https://circgenetics.ahajournals.org/content/10/5/e001700 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/102809 https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCGENETICS.116.001700 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28986452,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/circgenetics.116.001700,28986452,10.1161/circgenetics.116.001700,2982776418,,0,005-377-674-977-777; 010-392-318-799-720; 010-635-713-938-093; 012-080-974-008-894; 014-900-970-191-701; 015-307-411-123-672; 024-051-701-812-919; 026-487-721-578-808; 033-567-456-194-988; 034-109-646-564-300; 035-384-804-278-207; 037-920-866-166-04X; 046-108-585-498-071; 047-985-504-801-739; 054-916-609-067-379; 058-146-513-989-333; 059-196-881-657-414; 063-179-607-562-64X; 068-544-363-724-511; 079-540-059-302-710; 081-266-958-181-265; 093-107-829-204-536; 113-184-876-303-935; 120-625-025-967-025; 127-016-670-476-238; 136-722-192-706-16X; 137-316-197-301-21X; 143-284-918-988-191,33

Donald; Padet Siriyasatien; Alain Kohl,"The increasing global incidence of mosquito-borne infections is driving a need for effective control methods. Vector populations have expanded their geographical ranges, while increasing resistance to chemical insecticides and a lack of effective treatments or vaccines has meant that the development of vector control methods is essential in the fight against mosquito-transmitted diseases. This review will focus on Toxorhynchites, a non-hematophagous mosquito genus which is a natural predator of vector species and may be exploited as a biological control agent. Their effectiveness in this role has been strongly debated for many years and early trials have been marred by misinformation and incomplete descriptions. Here, we draw together current knowledge of the general biology of Toxorhynchites and discuss how this updated information will benefit their role in an integrated vector management program.",11,11,747,,Misinformation; Toxorhynchites; Vector management; General biology; Control methods; Biology; Environmental planning; Vector (epidemiology),Toxorhynchites; biological vector control; elephant mosquito,,,Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12014/8) United Kingdom; The Thailand Science Research and Innovation (Global Partnership Fiscal year 2020),https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/11/11/747 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7693308 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/223175/ https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/11/11/747/pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7693308 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33143104/ https://core.ac.uk/download/341601968.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects11110747,33143104,10.3390/insects11110747,3097193456,PMC7693308,0,000-440-525-231-055; 000-545-702-773-228; 000-553-891-623-527; 000-772-538-302-239; 000-791-939-445-162; 001-170-952-034-530; 001-952-985-963-455; 001-992-782-266-98X; 002-400-242-501-680; 002-579-869-410-953; 003-095-817-079-651; 003-490-536-212-241; 005-031-380-161-31X; 005-085-659-010-950; 005-514-994-715-926; 005-676-894-221-576; 006-273-952-533-616; 006-497-255-367-002; 006-561-297-884-968; 006-609-358-594-500; 006-858-240-508-651; 008-329-331-980-15X; 008-351-631-392-166; 008-371-626-221-520; 009-002-957-477-881; 009-238-574-832-998; 013-757-088-955-887; 014-717-130-975-233; 015-199-796-392-180; 015-676-267-171-832; 016-547-200-114-564; 016-994-865-104-576; 017-142-012-995-932; 017-157-200-214-63X; 018-577-080-396-818; 018-759-236-290-276; 020-008-239-567-773; 020-573-327-638-887; 020-651-705-344-124; 021-817-512-788-144; 022-055-050-755-337; 022-106-961-446-25X; 022-215-683-431-092; 022-929-927-402-533; 023-208-238-244-329; 023-729-882-300-751; 024-235-774-586-162; 025-080-752-440-448; 026-026-230-043-372; 026-426-957-220-125; 026-568-859-500-688; 026-771-054-952-12X; 027-532-610-267-130; 027-949-228-057-662; 027-953-756-507-980; 030-092-735-272-584; 030-249-799-782-551; 030-357-309-938-962; 031-307-696-960-828; 032-168-576-530-152; 032-539-573-973-396; 033-101-990-603-601; 033-231-915-223-495; 033-533-198-906-51X; 035-167-863-516-083; 036-240-714-493-687; 036-956-749-243-294; 037-030-002-576-987; 037-998-910-056-287; 038-157-961-309-088; 038-472-375-885-568; 038-473-419-710-394; 038-547-784-396-515; 039-302-798-329-066; 039-495-034-191-072; 039-636-288-228-978; 040-186-874-229-412; 040-307-531-283-204; 041-293-225-387-816; 042-799-340-176-226; 042-859-277-639-17X; 045-265-248-688-192; 045-582-862-744-560; 047-151-981-952-053; 048-478-576-396-015; 048-920-596-245-838; 050-550-204-622-160; 051-463-389-192-419; 051-907-628-364-156; 052-053-319-463-222; 053-119-925-365-820; 054-724-500-693-695; 055-410-644-743-748; 057-122-205-970-806; 062-788-180-335-938; 062-800-616-187-454; 063-008-550-721-278; 063-423-179-632-42X; 063-984-241-631-656; 063-993-715-505-630; 065-881-866-244-710; 066-183-993-426-048; 067-031-755-455-947; 069-171-897-847-476; 070-301-438-295-500; 071-240-032-649-671; 071-568-315-750-162; 071-593-100-355-848; 071-716-942-220-947; 074-134-466-960-627; 074-683-331-886-855; 076-135-083-808-895; 079-485-218-016-65X; 079-587-715-437-508; 081-144-201-601-656; 081-338-167-704-058; 081-983-541-123-328; 091-714-124-788-393; 092-096-490-156-135; 092-721-151-784-533; 096-137-939-044-058; 096-151-984-486-34X; 096-783-232-405-282; 097-095-058-795-998; 097-776-497-197-600; 098-908-946-846-425; 099-314-063-127-708; 099-477-883-212-250; 101-803-859-495-693; 102-001-473-835-909; 107-398-710-814-109; 108-456-936-767-797; 113-038-704-487-875; 117-421-935-556-521; 119-813-648-987-367; 120-465-218-376-184; 121-961-672-345-299; 125-096-989-784-11X; 128-047-588-390-388; 130-052-526-580-352; 130-993-130-122-579; 133-788-880-446-114; 134-071-612-622-749; 137-296-066-860-921; 137-373-118-550-383; 147-382-140-738-419; 148-976-130-015-342; 149-057-524-647-114; 152-781-193-287-470; 158-069-141-439-769; 158-334-735-048-25X; 161-109-964-838-789; 162-756-977-393-683; 165-520-389-068-794; 166-044-733-588-636; 171-902-824-396-209; 174-006-817-979-231; 181-925-162-131-141,2

The NUHDSS was established in 2002 to provide a platform to investigate the long-term social, economic and health consequences of urban residence, and to serve as a primary research tool for intervention and impact evaluation studies focusing on the needs of the urban poor in SSA. Since its inception, the NUHDSS has successfully followed every year a population of about 65,000 individuals in 24,000 households in two slum communities--Korogocho and Viwandani--in Nairobi, Kenya. Data collected include key demographic and health information (births, deaths including verbal autopsy, in- and out-migration, immunization) and other information that characterizes living conditions in the slums (livelihood opportunities, household amenities and possessions, type of housing etc.). In addition to the routine data, it has provided a robust platform for nesting several studies examining the challenges of rapid urbanization in SSA and associated health and poverty dynamics.

Despite there being a common goal that should have unified resources and efforts, there have been an overwhelmingly large number of clinical trials that have been registered that are of questionable methodological quality. As the final paper of this Series, we discuss how the medical research community has responded to COVID-19. We recognise the incredible pressure that this pandemic has put on researchers, regulators, and policy makers, all of whom were doing their best to move quickly but safely in a time of tremendous uncertainty. However, the research community's response to the COVID-19 pandemic has prominently highlighted many fundamental issues that exist in clinical trial research under the current system and its incentive structures. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only re-emphasised the importance of well designed randomised clinical trials but also highlighted the need for large-scale clinical trials structured according to a master protocol in a coordinated and collaborative manner. There is also a need for structures and incentives to enable faster data sharing of anonymised datasets, and a need to provide similar opportunities to those in high-income countries for clinical trial research in low-resource regions where clinical trial research receives considerably less research funding.",9,5,e711,e720,Medical research; Business; Data sharing; Protocol (science); Incentive; Public relations; Global health; Clinical research; Clinical trial; Pandemic,,Biomedical Research/trends; COVID-19/epidemiology; Global Health; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,,Medical Research Council (MR/L004283/1) United Kingdom; FIC NIH HHS (R25 TW011217) United States,https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8049590 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X20305428 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30542-8 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30542-8/fulltext https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/26598 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214109X20305428 https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/26598/2/How%20COVID-19%20has%20fundamentally%20changed%20clinical%20research%20in%20global%20health.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33865476/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8049590 https://ecommons.aku.edu/pakistan_fhs_mc_women_childhealth_paediatr/1014/ https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ar/covidwho-1189095,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(20)30542-8,33865476,10.1016/s2214-109x(20)30542-8,3156399049,PMC8049590,0,000-546-201-755-456; 000-824-042-765-020; 001-223-855-651-349; 002-236-092-817-783; 004-148-351-819-461; 004-388-082-074-520; 004-958-095-428-625; 005-216-391-582-065; 006-390-587-064-374; 006-747-050-858-931; 007-055-918-357-090; 007-083-326-821-628; 008-015-941-994-573; 008-969-076-065-872; 009-392-665-010-610; 009-638-765-110-093; 010-118-141-292-77X; 010-333-930-223-672; 011-481-326-357-86X; 012-947-955-914-292; 013-589-652-883-539; 013-654-735-442-817; 014-012-301-004-539; 014-066-894-007-471; 014-130-691-097-677; 014-260-577-535-261; 015-578-135-574-817; 016-197-668-121-930; 022-092-920-153-237; 023-591-289-869-454; 024-491-813-250-411; 025-738-368-428-303; 025-799-703-968-227; 026-318-902-883-863; 026-941-677-206-341; 028-235-036-618-252; 031-147-284-265-01X; 031-561-993-708-606; 032-354-112-046-716; 032-981-083-569-683; 033-620-057-542-199; 034-076-325-224-884; 034-548-036-987-474; 035-715-988-125-953; 039-899-641-275-148; 039-988-101-454-65X; 041-513-747-981-072; 043-336-546-020-484; 046-109-725-892-439; 047-048-081-990-374; 048-550-674-246-452; 048-911-526-369-152; 049-687-048-028-953; 050-106-026-625-105; 050-475-816-794-476; 051-768-765-064-97X; 056-424-112-152-027; 057-074-092-089-866; 058-470-343-040-532; 058-696-975-970-801; 059-261-195-932-891; 059-766-810-955-571; 060-681-626-763-361; 062-098-545-300-175; 062-109-608-117-687; 063-102-848-755-500; 066-366-074-062-249; 067-443-176-104-836; 070-892-674-264-578; 070-907-107-093-716; 071-295-484-660-01X; 072-182-587-546-258; 077-516-865-749-928; 077-594-920-432-581; 077-601-497-223-178; 079-033-593-157-369; 079-420-970-985-881; 081-657-243-714-898; 082-563-338-607-525; 083-115-065-447-868; 084-947-250-717-995; 086-896-717-876-216; 087-104-246-676-397; 090-136-896-175-070; 104-503-862-119-757; 110-527-581-256-281; 110-860-429-147-936; 116-185-337-689-385; 126-012-958-488-196; 141-669-591-445-850; 174-857-824-014-871,14

The platform needed to be relatively affordable, rapid to deploy, and use a common and accessible technology. Central to this project, we wanted to make the content of the platform open to any investigator without restriction. In designing this array we prioritized a number of types of genetic variability for inclusion, such as known risk alleles, disease-causing mutations, putative risk alleles, and other functionally important variants. The array was primarily designed to allow rapid screening of samples for disease-causing mutations and large population studies of risk factors. Notably, an explicit aim was to make this array widely available to facilitate data sharing across and within diseases. The resulting array, NeuroX, is a remarkably cost and time effective solution for high-quality genotyping. NeuroX comprises a backbone of standard Illumina exome content of approximately 240,000 variants, and over 24,000 custom content variants focusing on neurologic diseases. Data are generated at approximately $50–$60 per sample using a 12-sample format chip and regular Infinium infrastructure; thus, genotyping is rapid and accessible to many investigators. Here, we describe the design of NeuroX, discuss the utility of NeuroX in the analyses of rare and common risk variants, and present quality control metrics and a brief primer for the analysis of NeuroX derived data.",36,3,1.61E+10,12,Exome; Genome-wide association study; Genetic variability; Imputation (genetics); Data sharing; Genotyping Techniques; Genotyping; Genetics; Genetic variation; Computational biology; Medicine,Genetics; Genotyping; Imputation; Meta-analysis; Methods; Neurodegeneration; Parkinson's,Alleles; Costs and Cost Analysis; Genetic Association Studies/methods; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics; Genetic Variation; Genotyping Techniques/economics; Neurodegenerative Diseases/genetics; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods,,NHLBI NIH HHS (RC2 HL102926) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (U01 NS082151) United States; Medical Research Council (G1100643) United Kingdom; NCRR NIH HHS (UL1 RR033184) United States; Medical Research Council (MC_G1000735) United Kingdom; NINDS NIH HHS (R01 NS075321) United States; Wellcome Trust (089698) United Kingdom; NIA NIH HHS (Z01-AG000949-02) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HL-102925) United States; Intramural NIH HHS (Z01 AG000949-02) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (RC2 HL103010) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HL-102923) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (P50 NS071674) United States; NIA NIH HHS (U01 AG049505) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (RC2 HL102923) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (UC2 HL102926) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (UC2 HL103010) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HL-103010) United States; Medical Research Council (MR/L501554/1) United Kingdom; NHLBI NIH HHS (HL-102924) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (RC2 HL102924) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG008122) United States; Parkinson's UK (G-0909) United Kingdom; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG033193) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (HL-102926) United States; Intramural NIH HHS (Z01 AG000949) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (UC2 HL102923) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (UC2 HL102924) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (RC2 HL102925) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (UC2 HL102925) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR000127) United States; Medical Research Council (G0700943) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25444595 https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/neurox-a-fast-and-efficient-genotyping-platform-for-investigation https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/neurox-a-fast-and-efficient-genotyping-platform-for-investigation https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25444595/ https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/neurox-a-fast-and-efficient-genotyping-platform-for-investigation-of-neurodegenerative-diseases(5a3b46fd-aa68-4938-865f-5a7e2cea5e9e).html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4317375 https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/579194 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2Fbf8bb7c4-7ded-47de-b5eb-48910959d693 https://ora.ouls.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8f94b4ae-301f-4bd3-af2d-ac95b7e9f7ab https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/153490 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458014004977 https://core.ac.uk/display/46019006 http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2129580 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197458014004977 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/398181/ https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:8f94b4ae-301f-4bd3-af2d-ac95b7e9f7ab https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2129580 https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/neurox-a-fast-and-efficient-genotyping-platform-for-investigation https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/neurox-a-fast-and-efficient-genotyping-platform-for-investigation https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/neurox-a-fast-and-efficient-genotyping-platform-for-investigation,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.07.028,25444595,10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2014.07.028,1978669979,PMC4317375,0,010-222-602-223-17X; 011-868-941-880-827; 013-514-353-200-455; 015-393-609-508-491; 019-398-590-708-896; 019-603-929-554-874; 028-400-079-616-325; 034-921-764-522-520; 035-846-740-268-010; 037-868-383-394-667; 042-469-107-436-376; 044-892-661-507-929; 048-521-138-765-66X; 049-039-283-791-654; 059-365-387-693-932; 063-991-004-452-975; 080-103-811-433-234; 091-716-150-608-922; 094-477-111-932-678; 109-947-144-945-359; 113-063-323-171-02X; 133-656-523-418-92X; 166-907-228-172-577,90

Lazic; Jack R. Mellor; Michael C. Ashby; Marcus R. Munafò,"Pseudoreplication occurs when the number of measured values or data points exceeds the number of genuine replicates, and when the statistical analysis treats all data points as independent and thus fully contributing to the result. By artificially inflating the sample size, pseudoreplication contributes to irreproducibility, and it is a pervasive problem in biological research. In some fields, more than half of published experiments have pseudoreplication – making it one of the biggest threats to inferential validity. Researchers may be reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods if their hypothesis is about the pseudoreplicates and not the genuine replicates; for example, when an intervention is applied to pregnant female rodents (genuine replicates) but the hypothesis is about the effect on the multiple offspring (pseudoreplicates). We propose using a Bayesian predictive approach, which enables researchers to make valid inferences about biological entities of interest, even if they are pseudoreplicates, and show the benefits of this approach using two in vivo data sets.",10,1,2366,2366,Bayesian probability; Machine learning; Sample size determination; Artificial intelligence; Data point; Intervention (counseling); Computer science; Pseudoreplication,,,,RCUK | Medical Research Council (MRC) (MC_UU_00011/7) International; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/R002177/1) United Kingdom,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59384-7 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/a-bayesian-predictive-approach-for-dealing-with-pseudoreplication(593ad00b-01c7-47d3-9200-f7b8c70b6b7d)/export.html https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32047274 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/222880578/s41598_020_59384_7.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-59384-7.pdf https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/a-bayesian-predictive-approach-for-dealing-with-pseudoreplication(593ad00b-01c7-47d3-9200-f7b8c70b6b7d).html http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020NatSR..10.2366L/abstract https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/a-bayesian-predictive-approach-for-dealing-with-pseudoreplication https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32047274 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32047274,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59384-7,32047274,10.1038/s41598-020-59384-7,3006609564,PMC7012913,0,003-600-232-335-992; 004-068-544-417-178; 006-731-601-441-141; 009-844-407-427-581; 013-176-783-022-581; 018-142-268-214-921; 019-080-566-620-405; 020-631-014-246-594; 023-948-064-324-671; 029-039-079-169-352; 029-107-637-329-472; 032-067-023-957-495; 032-422-507-974-826; 033-075-105-991-554; 034-783-567-768-457; 040-261-449-428-207; 045-348-481-855-683; 058-458-638-092-960; 058-659-579-427-409; 059-236-956-307-050; 061-401-711-406-024; 063-706-529-753-740; 063-828-102-408-126; 067-394-052-780-607; 072-297-900-343-538; 095-549-313-217-097; 102-668-674-697-675; 122-432-905-067-609; 132-198-602-571-680; 150-764-147-723-043; 158-746-175-076-113; 161-115-633-176-873; 171-014-350-310-26X; 194-526-216-808-407; 195-660-281-158-491,13

Moore; Charis Cook; Ruth Bastow,"Despite the clear demand for open data sharing, its implementation within plant science is still limited. This is, at least in part, because open data-sharing raises several unanswered questions and challenges to current research practices. In this commentary, some of the challenges encountered by plant researchers at the bench when generating, interpreting, and attempting to disseminate their data have been highlighted. The difficulties involved in sharing sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data are reviewed. The benefits and drawbacks of three data-sharing venues currently available to plant scientists are identified and assessed: (i) journal publication; (ii) university repositories; and (iii) community and project-specific databases. It is concluded that community and project-specific databases are the most useful to researchers interested in effective data sharing, since these databases are explicitly created to meet the researchers’ needs, support extensive curation, and embody a heightened awareness of what it takes to make data reuseable by others. Such bottom-up and community-driven approaches need to be valued by the research community, supported by publishers, and provided with long-term sustainable support by funding bodies and government. At the same time, these databases need to be linked to generic databases where possible, in order to be discoverable to the majority of researchers and thus promote effective and efficient data sharing. As we look forward to a future that embraces open access to data and publications, it is essential that data policies, data curation, data integration, data infrastructure, and data funding are linked together so as to foster data access and research productivity.",64,14,4109,4117,Dissemination; Government; Data science; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Open data; Computer science; Data access; Data integration; Data curation,Data sharing; databases; metabolomics; open data; proteomics; publication; repositories; transcriptomics.,Access to Information; High-Throughput Screening Assays; Information Dissemination; Information Storage and Retrieval; Plants/metabolism; Science,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/F005903/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I020004/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBG0214811) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/G021481/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/J004057/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/K013602/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/F005806/1) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24043847 http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/14/4109.short https://core.ac.uk/display/18327387 https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/64/14/4109/686949 https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/64/14/4109/686949/Making-open-data-work-for-plant-scientists http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24043847 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24043847/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24043847 https://paperity.org/p/47219999/making-open-data-work-for-plant-scientists http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/57555/1/WRAP_Moore_J.%20Exp.%20Bot.-2013-Leonelli-jxb-ert273.pdf http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/57555/ https://core.ac.uk/download/18327387.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ert273,24043847,10.1093/jxb/ert273,2126676706,PMC3808334,0,000-143-278-480-597; 010-565-649-776-251; 012-306-942-917-945; 012-977-176-390-212; 015-046-320-639-128; 018-913-793-231-757; 021-680-514-391-920; 028-052-595-483-065; 028-648-386-304-339; 035-597-794-651-707; 037-512-130-164-057; 042-487-522-757-002; 049-503-529-534-487; 064-634-454-000-838; 069-450-639-713-805; 075-479-902-530-376; 076-174-239-479-488; 105-975-375-940-523; 110-083-316-759-991; 118-055-657-395-789; 145-534-673-773-02X; 192-452-508-501-587,25

Policies for data sharing should be responsive to public views, but there is little evidence of the systematic study of these from low-income countries. This qualitative study explored views on fair data-sharing processes among 60 stakeholders in Kenya with varying research experience, using a deliberative approach. Stakeholders’ attitudes were informed by perceptions of benefit and concerns for research data sharing, including risks of stigmatization, loss of privacy, and undermining scientific careers and validity, reported in detail elsewhere. In this article, we discuss institutional trust-building processes seen as central to perceptions of fairness in sharing research data in this setting, including forms of community involvement, individual prior awareness and agreement to data sharing, independence and accountability of governance mechanisms, and operating under a national framework.",10,3,264,277,Social responsibility; Political science; Qualitative research; Accountability; Community engagement; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Corporate governance; Public relations; Informed consent,Africa; Kenya; community consultation; data sharing; ethics; governance; informed consent; trust,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude; Biomedical Research; Community Participation; Cooperative Behavior; Data Collection; Developing Countries; Female; Humans; Income; Information Dissemination; Informed Consent; Kenya; Male; Middle Aged; Policy; Public Health; Qualitative Research; Research Personnel; Residence Characteristics; Social Responsibility",,Wellcome Trust (092654/Z/10/A) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (096527) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT085418) United Kingdom,https://ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/541710 https://www.weh.ox.ac.uk/publications/541710 https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/541710 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1556264615592385 https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/541710 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/541710 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1556264615592385 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4548475 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26297748 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1556264615592385 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/541710,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1556264615592385,26297748,10.1177/1556264615592385,2160708061,PMC4548475,0,001-624-916-522-59X; 004-352-766-892-319; 007-368-971-398-77X; 010-348-947-954-043; 010-527-516-552-564; 019-538-368-158-59X; 020-013-516-594-400; 021-672-229-560-342; 021-946-221-379-43X; 026-354-553-648-432; 027-614-876-022-826; 031-963-146-907-550; 032-520-030-950-067; 034-120-745-893-107; 034-226-623-297-644; 035-813-132-606-003; 037-126-838-015-529; 038-824-642-263-293; 041-351-846-842-204; 042-355-275-020-040; 043-461-666-754-223; 044-169-945-877-144; 044-230-020-749-669; 046-849-371-099-946; 067-481-268-141-412; 070-964-123-925-720; 073-359-242-136-904; 075-465-734-221-082; 091-182-490-204-656; 100-441-363-187-695; 109-577-063-176-767; 110-837-660-980-431; 118-085-022-435-430; 123-224-961-607-542; 124-707-160-725-322; 130-389-785-483-120; 135-302-870-468-483; 166-968-590-450-006,32

ELIXIR (www.elixir-europe.org), the European Research Infrastructure for life sciences data, has identified a set of Core Data Resources within Europe that are of most fundamental importance for the long-term preservation of biological data. We explore characteristics of their usage, impact and assured funding horizon to assess their value and importance as an infrastructure, to understand sustainability of the infrastructure, and to demonstrate a model for assessing Core Data Resources worldwide. Results: The nineteen resources currently designated ELIXIR Core Data Resources form a data infrastructure in Europe which is a subset of the worldwide open life science data infrastructure. We show that, from 2014 to 2018, data managed by the Core Data Resources more than tripled while staff numbers increased by less than a tenth. Additionally, support for the Core Data Resources is precarious: together they have assured funding for less than a third of current staff after four years. Our findings demonstrate the importance of the ELIXIR Core Data Resources as repositories for research data and knowledge, while also demonstrating the uncertain nature of the funding environment for this infrastructure. ELIXIR is working towards longer-term support for the Core Data Resources and, through the Global Biodata Coalition, aims to ensure support for the worldwide life science data resource infrastructure of which the ELIXIR Core Data Resources are a subset.",36,8,2636,2642,Elixir (programming language); Agriculture; Business; Core (game theory); Biological data; Biodata; Open data; Resource (project management); Knowledge management; Sustainability,,Biological Science Disciplines; Computational Biology,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,http://europepmc.org/article/MED/31950984 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/bioinformatics/bioinformatics36.html#DrysdaleCPGBGGH20 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31950984 https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz959 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31950984/ https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-pdf/36/8/2636/33116488/btz959.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7446027 https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/8/2636/5709034,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz959,31950984,10.1093/bioinformatics/btz959,2999321803,PMC7446027,0,002-674-207-145-869; 003-391-130-133-101; 003-806-971-406-428; 007-476-084-424-319; 008-514-753-111-311; 010-260-218-932-155; 011-981-765-750-672; 012-770-059-004-038; 019-444-649-825-70X; 022-526-129-975-007; 022-926-136-143-674; 024-175-467-256-911; 025-545-624-398-262; 030-307-018-489-751; 032-312-732-039-343; 039-136-390-477-822; 049-977-306-880-897; 054-158-433-521-207; 054-938-263-387-291; 061-320-956-708-480; 063-091-334-038-917; 067-016-341-834-781; 069-596-404-921-10X; 070-462-022-251-464; 072-652-532-293-533; 073-740-942-732-902; 074-386-743-302-579; 084-794-417-370-694; 087-190-941-539-945; 094-381-625-194-127; 094-534-401-459-661; 098-016-413-464-72X; 108-848-767-053-023; 117-248-321-927-15X; 123-930-933-291-120; 124-828-193-357-862; 131-310-027-630-517; 158-622-740-675-633; 197-322-317-312-341,26

In recent years, the introduction of data-driven technologies in healthcare has opened up the space for collaborations with private digital companies seeking access to patient data. However, these collaborations appear to challenge the public’s trust in the. In this paper we explore how the opening of the healthcare sector to private digital companies challenges the existing social contract and the NHS’s solidaristic character, and impacts on public trust. We start by critically discussing different examples of partnerships between the NHS and private companies that collect and use data. We then analyse the relationship between trust and solidarity, and investigate how this relationship changes in the context of digital companies entering the healthcare system. Finally, we show ways for the NHS to maintain public trust by putting in place a solidarity grounded partnership model with companies seeking to access patient data. Such a model would need to serve collective interests through, for example, securing preferential access to goods and services, providing health benefits, and monitoring data access. A solidarity grounded partnership model will help establish a social contract or licence that responds to the public’s expectations and to principles of a solidaristic healthcare system.",21,1,1,7,Philosophy of medicine; Business; Goods and services; Public trust; Data sharing; Context (language use); Solidarity; Public institution; Public relations; Social contract,Data sharing; Data-driven technologies; Private companies; Public trust; Solidaristic healthcare system; Solidarity,Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Trust,,Wellcome Trust (203132/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-020-00553-8 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12910-020-00553-8.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/HORSWC https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607840 https://doaj.org/article/9b5791d14fc84589830e68e4036f7563 https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-020-00553-8 https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/publications/1139342,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-020-00553-8,33143692,10.1186/s12910-020-00553-8,3097915150,PMC7607840,0,003-711-598-604-01X; 012-811-031-103-729; 018-905-427-826-830; 021-091-713-909-176; 023-315-807-815-86X; 029-509-486-839-10X; 032-591-365-730-734; 034-509-551-210-676; 040-680-861-345-311; 047-817-075-077-048; 051-083-830-071-008; 055-003-652-142-450; 062-145-164-741-072; 064-912-826-348-980; 068-569-622-384-349; 070-640-145-669-069; 078-249-789-490-901; 078-438-294-475-227; 080-147-835-556-137; 131-412-196-105-622; 154-822-682-588-275; 162-725-859-796-180; 166-151-425-331-381; 186-832-421-064-131,3

Potter,"Abstract While the citizen science approach has gained prominence in water and ecosystem services management, methodological limitations, insufficient resources invested in monitoring practices and a lack of effective mechanisms for integrating the approach into existing monitoring and decision making processes means that its full potential has yet to be realized. Nevertheless, the concept offers a real opportunity to address data gaps and assist decision makers operating under a wide range of socio-ecological and environmental uncertainties. In this paper, we report findings from a project in which low-cost sensors were deployed to collect hydrological data in two study locations in Nepal. We found evidence that the citizen science has potential to generate locally relevant data and knowledge which can enrich a much more polycentric governance of water ecosystem services management. However, some major challenges need to be overcome, in particular developing locally-tailored monitoring sensors, standardizing monitoring and data sharing practice, improving local capabilities to collect quality data and making the approach more sustainable and adaptive to emerging environmental threats and uncertainties. If sufficient attention can be given to these key challenges, citizen science looks set to play a significant future role in water and ecosystem services management.",3,,100059,,Business; Set (psychology); Citizen science; Key (cryptography); Data quality; Data sharing; Data poor; Corporate governance; Ecosystem services; Environmental planning,,,,Global Challenges Research Fund; Economic and Social Research Council; Natural Environment Research Council; Natural Environment Research Council; Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine; Israel Cancer Research Fund,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666049021000359,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crsust.2021.100059,,10.1016/j.crsust.2021.100059,3184462399,,0,000-785-692-812-344; 000-826-091-294-906; 001-117-752-253-058; 004-515-176-976-575; 005-996-427-454-47X; 006-264-658-298-083; 010-279-479-672-216; 011-485-089-313-385; 012-437-282-700-803; 012-995-343-723-344; 013-378-196-401-574; 017-330-643-380-748; 019-819-736-252-776; 020-412-303-065-124; 024-723-379-221-772; 026-042-327-890-463; 027-766-138-394-268; 030-075-468-430-415; 031-633-611-330-987; 032-956-056-961-343; 038-071-975-135-261; 038-138-085-237-649; 040-345-907-238-389; 045-181-423-237-180; 045-566-000-073-660; 047-833-007-161-424; 050-681-197-007-863; 050-810-960-791-232; 052-182-019-817-456; 052-872-226-551-310; 054-511-940-773-366; 060-622-407-950-968; 060-716-274-159-466; 066-796-262-704-253; 068-402-228-133-117; 071-134-130-847-090; 075-722-381-026-816; 077-890-065-884-873; 081-879-304-771-516; 084-149-167-565-234; 084-374-719-159-703; 087-144-304-406-413; 094-116-742-298-278; 097-410-983-286-637; 102-035-227-101-921; 103-081-387-145-206; 108-325-762-317-891; 108-499-182-315-814; 113-290-827-408-975; 114-753-966-441-139; 134-662-002-252-589; 147-682-929-413-325; 148-796-913-126-227; 149-573-711-256-144; 156-238-135-485-875; 160-304-109-079-520; 182-587-333-934-318; 191-224-414-736-130,1

Richmond-Rakerd; Stephanie D’Souza; Barry J. Milne; Avshalom Caspi; Terrie E. Moffitt,"Importance Excess risk of physical disease and mortality has been observed among individuals with psychiatric conditions, suggesting that ameliorating mental disorders might also be associated with ameliorating the later onset of physical disability and early mortality. However, the temporal association between mental disorders and physical diseases remains unclear, as many studies have relied on retrospective recall, used cross-sectional designs or prospective designs with limited follow-up periods, or given inadequate consideration to preexisting physical illnesses. Objective To examine whether mental disorders are associated with subsequent physical diseases and mortality across 3 decades of observation. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based cohort study used data from the New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure, a collection of nationwide administrative data sources linked at the individual level, to identify mental disorders, physical diseases, and deaths recorded between July 1, 1988, and June 30, 2018, in the population of New Zealand. All individuals born in New Zealand between January 1, 1928, and December 31, 1978, who resided in the country at any time during the 30-year observation period were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from July 2019 to November 2020. Exposures Nationwide administrative records of mental disorder diagnoses made in public hospitals. Main Outcomes and Measures Chronic physical disease diagnoses made in public hospitals, deaths, and health care use. Results The study population comprised 2 349 897 individuals (1 191 981 men [50.7%]; age range at baseline, 10-60 years). Individuals with a mental disorder developed subsequent physical diseases at younger ages (hazard ratio [HR], 2.33; 95% CI, 2.30-2.36) and died at younger ages (HR, 3.80; 95% CI, 3.72-3.89) than those without a mental disorder. These associations remained across sex and age and after accounting for preexisting physical diseases. Associations were observed across different types of mental disorders and self-harm behavior (relative risks, 1.78-2.43; P < .001 for all comparisons). Mental disorders were associated with the onset of physical diseases and the accumulation of physical disease diagnoses (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.00; 95% CI, 1.98-2.03), a higher number of hospitalizations (IRR, 2.43; 95% CI, 2.39-2.48), longer hospital stays for treatment (IRR, 2.70; 95% CI, 2.62-2.79), and higher associated health care costs (b = 0.115; 95% CI, 0.112-0.118). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, mental disorders were likely to begin and peak in young adulthood, and they antedated physical diseases and early mortality in the population. These findings suggest that ameliorating mental disorders may have implications for improving the length and quality of life and for reducing the health care costs associated with physical diseases.",4,1,e2033448,,Demography; Rate ratio; Cohort study; Young adult; Disease; Physical disability; Population; Population study; Medicine; Relative risk,,Adolescent; Adult; Child; Chronic Disease/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Longevity; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Disorders/complications; Middle Aged; New Zealand/epidemiology; Quality of Life,,NICHD NIH HHS (P2C HD065563) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (R03 HD050374) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG028716) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG034424) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG032282) United States; Medical Research Council (MR/P005918/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/P005918) United Kingdom,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/articlepdf/2774902/richmondrakerd_2021_oi_201021_1609792972.21408.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7807295 https://www.scilit.net/article/c32f2414ff294bfaad5d49b3cd11afeb http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7807295 https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/longitudinal-associations-of-mental-disorders-with-physical-diseases-and-mortality-among-23-million-new-zealand-citizens(e0f54dd7-a335-4abd-8c2f-61a5892ea9b4).html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33439264/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7807295 https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2774902,http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33448,33439264,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33448,3118240136,PMC7807295,0,000-705-860-954-489; 001-123-832-443-83X; 002-110-751-377-985; 003-553-493-726-087; 003-710-326-208-57X; 006-357-027-972-310; 012-023-236-591-968; 013-146-996-636-109; 016-412-421-488-49X; 032-578-797-738-098; 033-177-924-968-769; 033-351-315-900-305; 036-282-874-924-947; 040-152-257-545-828; 042-394-314-585-936; 042-699-286-585-580; 045-423-411-096-754; 045-543-262-104-736; 047-509-172-004-751; 048-763-518-924-513; 051-089-383-919-069; 059-744-410-736-313; 065-399-959-210-813; 074-699-857-933-990; 076-074-034-161-515; 088-610-990-246-334; 091-738-169-829-191; 095-004-690-310-510; 100-146-633-756-244; 104-627-809-714-527; 111-701-140-985-689; 116-557-172-173-253; 129-078-692-922-063; 160-765-475-369-925; 175-782-002-505-690,3

With the increasing amounts of data being produced, mere description of investigations as text in manuscripts is not sufficient to enable re-use anymore: the underlying data needs to be published together with the findings in the literature to maximise the benefit from public and private expenditure and to take advantage of an enormous opportunity to improve scientific reproducibility in metabolomics and cognate disciplines. Reporting recommendations in metabolomics started to emerge about a decade ago and were mostly concerned with inventories of the information that had to be reported in the literature for consistency. In recent years, metabolomics data standards have developed extensively, to include the primary research data, derived results and the experimental description and importantly the metadata in a machine-readable way. This includes vendor independent data standards such as mzML for mass spectrometry and nmrML for NMR raw data that have both enabled the development of advanced data processing algorithms by the scientific community. Standards such as ISA-Tab cover essential metadata, including the experimental design, the applied protocols, association between samples, data files and the experimental factors for further statistical analysis. Altogether, they pave the way for both reproducible research and data reuse, including meta-analyses. Further incentives to prepare standards compliant data sets include new opportunities to publish data sets, but also require a little “arm twisting” in the author guidelines of scientific journals to submit the data sets to public repositories such as the NIH Metabolomics Workbench or MetaboLights at EMBL-EBI. In the present article, we look at standards for data sharing, investigate their impact in metabolomics and give suggestions to improve their adoption.",12,1,1,13,Consistency (database systems); Raw data; Data file; Data science; Primary research; Vendor; Data sharing; Computer science; Publication; Metadata,Data sharing; Data standards; Experimental metadata; Mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; NMR,,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/H024921/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_EX_G0800783) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L01632X/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000933/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000771/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/E025080/1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4648992 https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/32516 https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/41353/ https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/data-standards-can-boost-metabolomics-research-and-if-there-is-a-will-there-is-a-way(aa6b7087-ebe9-42ae-992c-a00bd1f9fdbd).html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-015-0879-3 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-015-0879-3/fulltext.html https://core.ac.uk/display/77011377 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01232411 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11306-015-0879-3.pdf https://paperity.org/p/74852277/data-standards-can-boost-metabolomics-research-and-if-there-is-a-will-there-is-a-way http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1136092 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26612985 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/data-standards-can-boost-metabolomics-research-and-if-there-is-a-will-there-is-a-way(440ff813-07cc-4e7a-a1a2-0f8595b20803).html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11306-015-0879-3,26612985,10.1007/s11306-015-0879-3,2173728492,PMC4648992,0,000-909-941-070-364; 001-768-653-484-466; 003-046-498-462-846; 003-380-864-921-429; 005-653-137-906-912; 006-457-411-091-209; 007-661-635-121-360; 008-134-427-406-216; 009-764-085-540-142; 010-884-303-739-099; 011-307-079-107-287; 012-977-176-390-212; 014-793-338-069-744; 016-273-291-086-400; 018-119-534-531-116; 019-804-570-233-329; 020-942-979-231-75X; 022-090-795-823-537; 022-347-953-225-112; 027-432-061-970-430; 033-287-985-312-461; 035-787-377-411-718; 036-965-888-787-034; 040-722-359-245-043; 041-759-700-182-564; 042-487-522-757-002; 043-113-601-286-712; 045-802-993-975-010; 047-274-386-089-953; 049-012-654-002-459; 049-600-685-295-259; 049-698-939-529-843; 050-235-705-444-585; 051-032-003-027-345; 051-548-594-606-353; 052-394-822-287-33X; 054-711-082-679-360; 055-547-573-459-199; 056-058-515-282-179; 056-552-829-431-53X; 056-790-779-670-48X; 064-182-709-618-919; 065-183-473-321-924; 068-223-082-354-713; 074-273-534-252-025; 074-614-949-934-346; 079-217-687-792-191; 082-730-242-636-132; 084-213-185-304-701; 085-882-395-201-561; 087-523-235-485-25X; 088-291-111-446-677; 090-274-688-300-629; 092-518-663-349-873; 100-840-528-972-746; 105-906-257-589-681; 119-960-523-898-985; 123-058-492-304-395; 126-126-371-693-17X; 141-385-908-483-720; 142-786-140-330-228; 155-493-120-487-909; 183-022-769-808-433; 185-535-532-985-956,124

Primaquine is also known to cause haemolysis in people with variants of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the risk of adverse effects in people with G6PD deficiency given primaquine or other 8-aminoquinoline (8AQ) as a single dose or short course (less than 7 days).; ; Methods and analysis: We will search the following databases: Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. Prospective cohort studies, randomised and quasi-randomised trials that evaluated 8AQs for whatever reason in adults or children with a known G6PD deficiency will be included.

2457,035-494-139-022-339,The Health Care Sector's Experience of Blockchain: A Cross-disciplinary Investigation of Its Real Transformative Potential.,2021-12-20,2021,journal article,Journal of medical Internet research,14388871,Journal of medical Internet Research,Canada,Karen Yeung,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Academic literature highlights blockchain's potential to transform health care, particularly by seamlessly and securely integrating existing data silos while enabling patients to exercise automated, fine-grained control over access to their electronic health records. However, no serious scholarly attempt has been made to assess how these technologies have in fact been applied to real-world health care contexts.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"">The primary aim of this paper is to assess whether blockchain's theoretical potential to deliver transformative benefits to health care is likely to become a reality by undertaking a critical investigation of the health care sector's actual experience of blockchain technologies to date.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">This mixed methods study entailed a series of iterative, in-depth, theoretically oriented, desk-based investigations and 2 focus group investigations. It builds on the findings of a companion research study documenting real-world engagement with blockchain technologies in health care. Data were sourced from academic and gray literature from multiple disciplinary perspectives concerned with the configuration, design, and functionality of blockchain technologies. The analysis proceeded in 3 stages. First, it undertook a qualitative investigation of observed patterns of blockchain for health care engagement to identify the application domains, data-sharing problems, and the challenges encountered to date. Second, it critically compared these experiences with claims about blockchain's potential benefits in health care. Third, it developed a theoretical account of challenges that arise in implementing blockchain in health care contexts, thus providing a firmer foundation for appraising its future prospects in health care.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Health care organizations have actively experimented with blockchain technologies since 2016 and have demonstrated proof of concept for several applications (use cases) primarily concerned with administrative data and to facilitate medical research by enabling algorithmic models to be trained on multiple disparately located sets of patient data in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. However, blockchain technology is yet to be implemented at scale in health care, remaining largely in its infancy. These early experiences have demonstrated blockchain's potential to generate meaningful value to health care by facilitating data sharing between organizations in circumstances where computational trust can overcome a lack of social trust that might otherwise prevent valuable cooperation. Although there are genuine prospects of using blockchain to bring about positive transformations in health care, the successful development of blockchain for health care applications faces a number of very significant, multidimensional, and highly complex challenges. Early experience suggests that blockchain is unlikely to rapidly and radically revolutionize health care.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The successful development of blockchain for health care applications faces numerous significant, multidimensional, and complex challenges that will not be easily overcome, suggesting that blockchain technologies are unlikely to revolutionize health care in the near future.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>©Karen Yeung.

Findings are drawn from a sample of 994 Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses that are members of the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland. Multivariate findings show that home-based businesses are associated with high proportions of online sales supporting the view of home-based businesses as ‘online’ businesses. However, quantitatively, the overall transformational effects of digital technologies on the nature and processes of entrepreneurship are rather small as the vast majority of home-based businesses, like SMEs that are not home-based, trade offline. Online business models represent a very small proportion of the home-based business sector. Home-based businesses in rural areas do not make greater use of e-commerce. The findings add to the critical literature on the transformative nature of digital entrepreneurship and the emerging home-based business literature that question whether the role of digital technologies and online marketplaces for home-based businesses are being exaggerated, particularly in rural economies.",135,,102542,,Rural area; Business sector; Business; Marketing; Digital economy; Home based; Transformational leadership; Sample (statistics); Transformative learning; Entrepreneurship,,,,Economic and Social Research Council,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001632872030032X https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001632872030032X http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/211726/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/296229174.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2020.102542,,10.1016/j.futures.2020.102542,3009994151,,0,001-155-824-457-728; 003-114-027-528-353; 003-658-278-805-795; 005-345-886-542-269; 007-170-141-653-862; 009-007-421-701-622; 011-356-708-558-349; 013-040-106-451-052; 013-083-431-368-316; 016-645-212-354-089; 017-753-810-634-122; 019-109-325-510-164; 023-813-559-229-133; 028-010-910-489-622; 028-233-481-019-080; 031-056-510-096-362; 031-402-331-384-958; 032-340-534-879-550; 032-396-284-183-640; 036-310-280-176-705; 037-438-778-620-366; 045-991-987-579-711; 047-685-996-841-088; 047-979-740-613-763; 048-990-422-798-065; 049-488-249-391-984; 050-037-559-345-732; 051-305-860-459-143; 053-853-794-942-822; 054-903-802-056-409; 056-353-010-657-782; 058-988-132-063-132; 061-769-228-397-928; 062-000-318-043-203; 062-266-422-787-139; 068-173-680-265-275; 068-509-731-511-47X; 069-949-537-868-438; 080-277-743-291-659; 082-707-231-355-743; 085-981-849-981-966; 089-737-543-379-199; 091-713-135-129-575; 096-108-350-507-432; 112-045-343-583-472; 114-079-934-939-504; 115-515-694-727-100; 115-845-272-631-063; 116-027-050-601-469; 121-582-433-784-251; 124-020-492-005-208; 125-436-275-173-024; 130-284-509-403-031; 137-995-391-757-111; 141-053-577-789-328; 141-174-156-242-931; 156-308-555-575-229; 157-271-718-636-12X; 160-650-934-403-441; 165-598-774-607-168; 167-795-776-674-650; 168-081-672-976-875; 171-630-109-874-99X; 175-855-012-854-557; 184-304-295-864-581,13

Morley,"Analyzing genomic data across populations is central to understanding the role of genetic factors in health and disease. Successful data sharing relies on public support, which requires attention to whether people around the world are willing to donate their data that are then subsequently shared with others for research. However, studies of such public perceptions are geographically limited and do not enable comparison. This paper presents results from a very large public survey on attitudes toward genomic data sharing. Data from 36,268 individuals across 22 countries (gathered in 15 languages) are presented. In general, publics across the world do not appear to be aware of, nor familiar with, the concepts of DNA, genetics, and genomics. Willingness to donate one's DNA and health data for research is relatively low, and trust in the process of data's being shared with multiple users (e.g., doctors, researchers, governments) is also low. Participants were most willing to donate DNA or health information for research when the recipient was specified as a medical doctor and least willing to donate when the recipient was a for-profit researcher. Those who were familiar with genetics and who were trusting of the users asking for data were more likely to be willing to donate. However, less than half of participants trusted more than one potential user of data, although this varied across countries. Genetic information was not uniformly seen as different from other forms of health information, but there was an association between seeing genetic information as special in some way compared to other health data and increased willingness to donate. The global perspective provided by our ""Your DNA, Your Say"" study is valuable for informing the development of international policy and practice for sharing genomic data. It highlights that the research community not only needs to be worthy of trust by the public, but also urgent steps need to be taken to authentically communicate why genomic research is necessary and how data donation, and subsequent sharing, is integral to this.",107,4,743,752,Internet privacy; Medical ethics; Peer review; Psychology; Perspective (graphical); Perception; Donation; Public trust; Disease; Data sharing,attitudes; data donation; data sharing; genomic data; genomic data sharing; global; health data; public; survey; trust,"Adult; Americas; Asia; Australia; Europe; Female; Genome, Human; Genomics/ethics; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Male; Public Health/ethics; Sequence Analysis, DNA/ethics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust/psychology",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://oda.oslomet.no/oda-xmlui/handle/11250/2760207 https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/803798 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/142147 https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP68288.html http://ecite.utas.edu.au/142147/3/142147%20-%20Global%20Public%20Perceptions%20of%20Genomic%20Data%20Sharing.pdf https://eprints.utas.edu.au/36296/ https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/d46c7913-3b6c-490c-b521-b259b84d1714 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929720302925 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/273751 https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(20)30292-5 http://oars.uos.ac.uk/1443/ https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/global-public-perceptions-of-genomic-data-sharing-what-shapes-the https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32946764/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7536612 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02953741 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32946764 https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/global-public-perceptions-of-genomic-data-sharing(36cc40b2-00bb-4215-8d68-f0e4b420682e).html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.08.023,32946764,10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.08.023,3087388176,PMC7536612,0,002-233-715-333-627; 003-361-281-809-829; 005-168-044-166-864; 008-245-822-029-459; 010-938-575-860-707; 011-400-966-586-903; 013-049-925-680-431; 015-742-781-002-76X; 017-154-071-526-43X; 019-372-152-115-163; 020-748-359-683-30X; 021-925-215-428-423; 028-176-809-501-48X; 028-900-415-372-560; 039-309-388-213-812; 040-322-708-659-111; 042-558-635-197-000; 047-632-315-687-283; 050-602-132-442-76X; 051-885-200-969-600; 055-508-579-884-688; 055-622-564-448-604; 061-632-702-294-17X; 066-971-101-246-437; 072-981-646-769-656; 097-541-776-603-863; 115-518-669-480-656; 117-847-857-173-119; 133-716-966-288-804; 150-325-162-873-23X,17

Whole-genome sequencing and high-resolution imaging technologies are key drivers of this rapid and crucial transformation. Technological innovation combined with automation and miniaturization has triggered an explosion in data production that will soon reach exabyte proportions. How are we going to deal with this exponential increase in data production? The potential of “big data” for improving health is enormous but, at the same time, we face a wide range of challenges to overcome urgently. Europe is very proud of its cultural diversity; however, exploitation of the data made available through advances in genomic medicine, imaging, and a wide range of mobile health applications or connected devices is hampered by numerous historical, technical, legal, and political barriers. European health systems and databases are diverse and fragmented. There is a lack of harmonization of data formats, processing, analysis, and data transfer, which leads to incompatibilities and lost opportunities. Legal frameworks for data sharing are evolving. Clinicians, researchers, and citizens need improved methods, tools, and training to generate, analyze, and query data effectively. Addressing these barriers will contribute to creating the European Single Market for health, which will improve health and healthcare for all Europeans.",8,1,71,71,Cultural diversity; Health care; Data science; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Action plan; European union; Computer science; Exabyte; Bioinformatics; Big data,,"Biomedical Research/legislation & jurisprudence; Databases, Factual/legislation & jurisprudence; European Union/organization & administration; Health Plan Implementation; Humans; Information Dissemination/legislation & jurisprudence",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk:8443/handle/10044/1/38544 https://publications.uni.lu/handle/10993/28371 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13073-016-0323-y/fulltext.html https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/38544/2/Making%20sense%20of%20big%20data%20in%20health%20research%3a%20Towards%20an%20EU%20action%20plan.pdf https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4919856 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:950617 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs13073-016-0323-y.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/45290811 https://zaguan.unizar.es/record/56325?ln=es https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/137653 https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/28371 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/337769 https://publications.rwth-aachen.de/record/687600 https://cds.cern.ch/record/2258389/files/Gen-Med-8-71.pdf https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/107077/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13073-016-0323-y https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4919856 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27338147 https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0323-y https://cds.cern.ch/record/2258389 https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2309655 https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/27945 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/making-sense-of-big-data-in-health-research(1a68eabc-5f23-438b-8475-6498de29df07).html https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/294995/1/Making%20sense%20of%20big%20data%20in%20health%20research%3a%20Towards%20an%20EU%20action%20plan.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27338147/ https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13073-016-0323-y http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13073-016-0323-y https://zaguan.unizar.es/record/56325 https://edoc.unibas.ch/53568/ https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.tue.nl%3Apublications%2Ff05c4663-3fed-4810-9e96-6ad286148537 https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/28371/1/art%253A10.1186%252Fs13073-016-0323-y.pdf https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/294995 https://research.tue.nl/nl/publications/making-sense-of-big-data-in-health-research-towards-an-eu-action- https://core.ac.uk/download/161650195.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13073-016-0323-y,27338147,10.1186/s13073-016-0323-y,2473046424,PMC4919856,0,000-867-670-850-20X; 000-992-363-840-40X; 002-421-085-899-703; 002-466-484-062-301; 002-932-234-698-601; 005-196-744-024-144; 005-550-008-145-57X; 005-563-328-581-568; 006-855-031-851-679; 008-184-472-773-838; 010-123-414-459-560; 010-388-496-802-353; 011-452-956-920-87X; 011-871-848-229-551; 015-488-842-942-210; 016-951-011-769-830; 018-313-377-143-513; 020-283-868-252-690; 021-110-891-377-417; 021-846-597-556-926; 022-526-129-975-007; 024-489-261-896-798; 026-984-229-469-818; 028-181-590-078-555; 028-339-556-730-404; 028-957-604-725-377; 031-176-634-933-405; 032-179-495-976-607; 032-560-259-589-421; 032-835-766-472-279; 033-522-779-382-087; 033-647-424-920-99X; 034-119-370-850-398; 034-351-039-278-295; 034-646-837-901-30X; 035-195-449-108-357; 036-542-880-583-796; 037-249-325-010-896; 037-419-915-458-008; 037-459-450-548-375; 039-311-832-173-355; 041-987-037-059-993; 044-219-961-031-694; 044-278-715-593-026; 044-371-975-644-56X; 045-572-662-699-030; 046-586-961-264-671; 047-261-875-461-506; 047-860-229-229-301; 052-522-253-317-714; 053-190-290-676-183; 058-785-167-055-458; 058-859-233-471-556; 059-765-824-380-292; 060-485-581-184-914; 062-491-224-573-907; 063-038-607-152-748; 064-865-801-324-81X; 066-860-419-370-866; 070-462-022-251-464; 076-194-638-441-311; 076-376-067-632-524; 077-980-623-471-467; 078-559-969-254-045; 079-137-793-871-512; 081-513-858-225-844; 083-178-710-561-208; 084-529-723-108-427; 086-745-871-141-420; 088-116-439-007-08X; 089-845-046-959-350; 090-281-523-674-775; 091-913-936-018-636; 093-442-700-990-765; 097-375-990-175-213; 098-761-138-998-267; 101-297-804-507-344; 105-352-534-453-028; 105-825-160-433-803; 107-139-402-287-961; 109-895-401-678-262; 113-319-930-033-602; 113-500-323-595-394; 113-933-345-807-873; 119-829-557-273-947; 120-794-211-617-421; 122-798-179-656-332; 124-357-689-413-110; 129-652-642-211-46X; 133-184-270-179-285; 139-041-881-801-360; 140-425-251-870-538; 141-188-420-103-584; 144-513-317-658-78X; 153-204-332-019-625; 153-286-415-016-288; 161-265-952-576-157; 171-283-758-280-186; 177-609-002-200-524,175

Valdés Hernández; Cyril Pernet; Eleni Sakka; Dominic Job; Adam D. Waldman; Joanna M. Wardlaw,"Research involving brain imaging is important for understanding common brain diseases. Study endpoints can include features and measures derived from imaging modalities, providing a benchmark against which other phenotypical data can be assessed. In trials, imaging data provide objective evidence of beneficial and adverse outcomes. Multi-centre studies increase generalisability and statistical power. However, there is a lack of practical guidelines for the set-up and conduct of large neuroimaging studies. We address this deficit by describing aspects of study design and other essential practical considerations that will help researchers avoid common pitfalls and data loss. The recommendations are grouped into seven categories: (1) planning, (2) defining the imaging endpoints, developing an imaging manual and managing the workflow, (3) performing a dummy run and testing the analysis methods, (4) acquiring the scans, (5) anonymising and transferring the data, (6) monitoring quality, and (7) using structured data and sharing data. Implementing these steps will lead to valuable and usable data and help to avoid imaging data wastage.",20,1,1,10,Benchmark (computing); Workflow; Data loss; Medical physics; Data sharing; Objective Evidence; Neuroimaging; Medicine; Big data; Statistical power,Big data; Data sharing; Guidelines; Longitudinal; Magnetic resonance imaging; Multi-centre; Study design,Brain/diagnostic imaging; Endpoint Determination; Humans; Information Dissemination; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality Control; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design,,Medical Research Council (G0701120) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G1001245) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M013111/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/R024065/1) United Kingdom,https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/longitudinal-multicentre-brain-imaging-studies-guidelines-and-practical-tips-for-accurate-and-reproducible-imaging-endpoints-and-data-sharing(62124cbd-df22-4cec-ab71-73382bf9021f).html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13063-018-3113-6.pdf https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-018-3113-6 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13063-018-3113-6 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/longitudinal-multi-centre-brain-imaging-studies-guidelines-and-pr https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30616680 https://core.ac.uk/download/322482279.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-018-3113-6,30616680,10.1186/s13063-018-3113-6,2943985574,PMC6323670,0,002-482-647-335-731; 004-649-811-516-652; 004-715-609-124-72X; 004-741-020-031-60X; 005-225-291-076-135; 006-565-786-489-81X; 017-453-800-978-63X; 020-545-229-948-795; 026-785-343-153-014; 026-899-529-686-893; 027-342-997-443-831; 028-981-771-120-279; 034-179-968-203-384; 037-956-910-465-114; 041-135-477-578-260; 042-611-491-010-218; 042-934-190-677-349; 046-520-740-962-255; 050-482-133-724-204; 052-425-025-955-058; 052-651-447-836-011; 054-576-660-798-697; 056-333-790-660-975; 057-888-758-245-259; 061-291-248-631-101; 066-638-315-686-615; 069-789-988-999-699; 071-660-541-588-791; 073-307-918-556-286; 080-760-527-236-938; 085-361-807-340-952; 092-226-924-969-700; 108-167-606-076-984; 123-958-152-397-939; 131-600-318-299-188,8

S. McNeill; Nicola Knight; Samuel Munday; Jeremy G. Frey,"This year the AI3SD Network+ (Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Intelligence for Automated Investigations for Scientific Discovery) will be running a workshop at the WebSci ’20 Conference in Southampton, UK. Artificial and Augmented Intelligence systems have the potential to make a real difference in the scientific discovery domain however this brings a new wealth of ethical and societal implications to consider with regards to this research (e.g. human enhancement, algorithmic biases, risk of detriment). This workshop looks to explore the ethical and societal issues centered around using intelligent technologies (Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Intelligence, Machine Learning, and in general Semantic Web Knowledge Technologies) to further scientific discovery, with a strong consideration of data ethics and algorithmic accountability. Advances in technology and software are rarely inherently bad in themselves, however that unfortunately does not preclude them from being subverted to ill intent by others; furthermore, as demonstrated by the examples above, even an unintentional lack of care towards ethical codes and algorithmic accountability can lead to societal and ethical implications of scientific discovery. It is our responsibility as researchers to consider these issues in our research; are we conducting studies ethically? What ethical codes can we put in place for scientific discovery research to mitigate against ethical and societal issues. These are really important issues, and they require an interdisciplinary focus between scientists, social scientists and technical experts in order to be comprehensively addressed. AI4Good is a day long workshop including five keynotes, discussion sessions and an interactive activity. The first keynote is from Dr Will McNeill, from the University of Southampton. Will is a lecturer in Philosophy, and he will speak about Ethical Frameworks and Ethical Judgements. The second keynote will be given by Dr Cian O’Donnovan, a Researcher at UCL. Cian’s research is based on understanding how the benefits of emerging technologies can best contribute to a flourishing world. Cian’s talk will be on AI Ethics from the Ground Up: Cultivating Capabilities for Care. The third keynote will be given by Jacqui Ayling, a PhD Student at the University of Southampton. Jacqui’s PhD is on the topic of researching data protection and innovation in smart cities. She will be talking about Data Ethics for AI & Algorithmic Accountability. The fourth keynote will be given by Dr Peter Craigon from the University of Nottingham. Peter is a Research Fellow specialising in Ethics, and his talk will focus on the Moral IT Cards that he has developed. The final keynote will be given by Dr Samantha Kanza, an Enterprise Fellow at the University of Southampton. Samantha coordinates the AI for Scientific Discovery Network and developed a keen interest in the ethical and societal issues of technology whilst completing her PhD in Web Science. She will be presenting on Ethics for AI for Scientific Discovery.",,,70,,Ethical code; Sociology; Morality; Emerging technologies; Accountability; Human enhancement; Web science; Engineering ethics; Data Protection Act 1998; Intelligence amplification,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/websci/websci2020c.html#KanzaMKMF20 https://doi.org/10.1145/3394332.3402894 https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3394332.3402894,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3394332.3402894,,10.1145/3394332.3402894,3039664926,,0,,0

We want to highlight that this situation, unprecedented in the field, opens a plethora of opportunities for data scientists. First, we explain in some detail some of the work already achieved, such as systematic reanalysis efforts. We also explain existing applications of public proteomics data, such as proteogenomics and the creation of spectral libraries and spectral archives.

Harrington; Nicolette Meshkat; Anne Shiu,"In systems and synthetic biology, much research has focused on the behavior and design of single pathways, while, more recently, experimental efforts have focused on how cross-talk (coupling two or more pathways) or inhibiting molecular function (isolating one part of the pathway) affects systems-level behavior. However, the theory for tackling these larger systems in general has lagged behind. Here, we analyze how joining networks (e.g., cross-talk) or decomposing networks (e.g., inhibition or knock-outs) affects three properties that reaction networks may possess—identifiability (recoverability of parameter values from data), steady-state invariants (relationships among species concentrations at steady state, used in model selection), and multistationarity (capacity for multiple steady states, which correspond to multiple cell decisions). Specifically, we prove results that clarify, for a network obtained by joining two smaller networks, how properties of the smaller networks can be inferred from or can imply similar properties of the original network. Our proofs use techniques from computational algebraic geometry, including elimination theory and differential algebra.",80,6,1683,1731,Identifiability; Topology; Elimination theory; Differential algebra; Gröbner basis; Computer science; Coupling (computer programming); Algebraic geometry; Steady state (electronics); Model selection,Gröbner basis; Identifiability; Mass-action kinetics; Multistationarity; Reaction network; Steady-state invariant,"Animals; Apoptosis/physiology; Biochemical Phenomena; Humans; Kinetics; Linear Models; Mathematical Concepts; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Models, Biological; Signal Transduction; Synthetic Biology; Systems Biology",,Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Royal Society University Research Fellowship; Henry Luce Foundation; Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences; Simons Foundation,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-020-01477-y https://www.scilit.net/article/d8d0625260f900af1484d67e4afddb73 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32123964 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32123964,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00285-020-01477-y,32123964,10.1007/s00285-020-01477-y,3009119295,,0,000-034-525-428-292; 000-192-124-437-597; 000-257-422-531-201; 000-935-235-017-856; 001-108-422-292-527; 006-570-962-938-124; 006-879-620-867-851; 011-271-753-078-915; 011-857-646-683-464; 013-249-930-886-457; 013-366-273-959-427; 014-071-817-134-377; 016-677-284-555-708; 016-839-123-799-436; 016-847-538-800-988; 017-896-426-794-146; 019-106-769-384-855; 019-375-771-541-456; 022-257-039-747-796; 022-951-991-340-550; 027-351-886-837-752; 027-422-912-983-813; 030-106-271-889-336; 030-230-759-169-306; 035-016-531-999-252; 036-488-905-815-932; 039-838-968-890-477; 040-071-691-157-719; 041-864-112-509-449; 042-610-690-555-742; 042-815-487-536-449; 044-127-854-037-355; 044-496-678-207-995; 045-533-628-402-633; 045-881-434-245-052; 045-890-713-331-097; 055-610-039-828-491; 056-632-648-843-279; 056-930-474-811-351; 059-084-772-650-313; 061-261-927-475-473; 062-487-089-719-966; 068-497-968-576-911; 069-219-677-322-475; 071-077-836-323-872; 072-164-014-715-860; 072-349-880-139-16X; 072-638-423-596-614; 073-185-141-093-506; 073-646-502-760-239; 074-601-806-710-81X; 075-615-616-009-129; 076-133-813-999-242; 076-639-041-026-237; 080-302-482-952-077; 081-800-821-110-615; 088-297-269-109-336; 094-043-891-335-453; 101-564-195-289-647; 103-196-100-069-091; 106-124-515-435-037; 110-743-721-738-693; 122-820-568-085-463; 127-036-261-916-886; 134-241-687-406-249; 134-467-378-236-356; 136-685-192-414-706; 139-487-881-043-607; 139-826-203-421-668; 141-242-172-031-087; 141-923-415-914-647; 171-272-156-598-695; 172-593-144-747-853; 177-418-817-032-777,22

Kapulu; Masuzyo Chirwa-Chobe; Hope Mwanyungwi-Chinganya; Stanley Mwale; Roma Chilengi; Anjali Sharma,"Human infection studies (HIS) have generally been used as a tool in the pathway for vaccine development in high income settings. Over the last decade, this model has been implemented in LMICs with the aim of accelerating development of next generation vaccines that would perform better in these settings. However, in most LMICs, the ethics and regulatory framework for the conduct of these studies are not in place. In Zambia, these studies are yet to be conducted and thus we conducted a stakeholder engagement workshop in October 2019. We engaged with bioethicists, regulatory authority officials, and scientists from within Zambia and other African countries to anticipate and address foreseeable ethical and regulatory issues when conducting HIS in Zambia for the first time. The workshop largely focused on sensitizing the stakeholders on the benefits of these studies with the following main points for consideration on the implementation of these studies in Zambia: need for in-country legal framework and guidelines; need for adequate informed consent based on comprehensive understanding of the concept of HIS and study requirements; and requirements for heightened vigilance to assure participant safety including good ethical and clinical practice with regulatory, ethical, data safety, and community oversight. Additionally, the workshop emphasized the need for rigorous health screening prior to enrolment; suitable infrastructure for containment; and personnel to provide appropriate treatment including emergency resuscitation and evacuation if indicated. Specific recommendations included compensation for burden of participation; access to care and provision for study related injury (e.g. no-fault insurance); and withdrawal and exit procedures to preserve individual and community safety. Finally, the meeting concluded that researchers should actively engage key gate keepers including civic leaders such as parliamentarians, universities, researchers, potential participants and laypersons to avoid circulation of misinformation.",6,,31,31,Political science; Misinformation; Clinical Practice; Stakeholder engagement; Regulatory authority; Community safety; Health screening; Public relations; Informed consent,Challenge agent; Compensation; HIC; Human Infection Challenge Studies; Resource limited setting; Rotavirus; Salmonella Typhi; Shigella; Vaccine; Vibrio Cholerae; Zambia; informed consent,,,Wellcome Trust,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-31/v2/xml https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993625.2 https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR282454 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-31 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/1161314 https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:89393f7a-59ab-48df-bf7a-7eb648332006 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824912 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33824912/,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16432.2,33824912,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16432.2; 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16432.1,3131080576,PMC7993625,0,004-732-886-465-113; 005-995-350-024-847; 009-414-396-919-870; 013-394-187-859-727; 020-393-322-296-082; 026-318-494-029-659; 027-113-708-023-808; 027-902-650-875-638; 031-119-310-346-553; 032-200-045-520-980; 038-875-468-043-454; 041-522-710-334-992; 044-934-481-215-964; 068-086-558-741-914; 070-135-592-926-605; 070-543-421-706-037; 070-745-423-500-951; 081-991-677-210-922; 086-358-167-687-147; 087-989-536-906-745; 090-076-530-079-55X; 094-206-928-373-677; 114-127-546-094-275; 148-876-527-214-333; 153-863-684-112-531; 189-084-525-063-705; 197-196-468-043-391,0

Evaluation is further made inconsistent, even unrepresentative of real world usage by the lack of distinction between the different types of toponyms, which necessitates new guidelines, a consolidation of metrics and a detailed toponym taxonomy with implications for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and beyond. To address these deficiencies, our manuscript introduces a new framework in three parts. (Part 1) Task Definition: clarified via corpus linguistic analysis proposing a fine-grained Pragmatic Taxonomy of Toponyms. (Part 2) Metrics: discussed and reviewed for a rigorous evaluation including recommendations for NER/Geoparsing practitioners. (Part 3) Evaluation data: shared via a new dataset called GeoWebNews to provide test/train examples and enable immediate use of our contributions.

Prior; Rajko Reljic; Samantha Vermaak; Martin Vordermeier; Ann Williams; Helen McShane,"For several complex intracellular pathogens, we have an urgent need for effective vaccines and yet there are common barriers to vaccine development. These diseases, including tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, leprosy and melioidosis, cause a huge burden of disease and disproportionately affect low and middle income countries. They are therefore often neglected due to the marginalisation of affected populations and the poor predicted commercial return on investment. Barriers to vaccine development include an incomplete understanding of protective immunity and translation from the bench into clinical vaccine trials. The current linear approach to vaccine research and development for these pathogens, which involves basic research, vaccine design, and vaccine evaluation in preclinical challenge models and clinical trials, is inefficient for these complex intracellular pathogens. We have established a Global Challenges Research Fund Network for VAccine deveLopment for complex Intracellular neglecteD pAThogEns, ""VALIDATE"", where we aim to adopt a more flexible, integrated cross-pathogen approach to accelerate vaccine research and clinical development for these four pathogens, by cross-pathogen analyses, cross-discipline collaborations, and repeated integration of data from human and animal studies. This network provides a unique opportunity to bring together individuals working on four exemplar complex intracellular neglected pathogens ( M.tb, Leishmania spp., B. pseudomallei and M.leprae), which share a common lifestyle as pathogens of macrophages, induce similar end-stage pathologies and alter host immune and metabolic responses. The horizontal collaborations established throughout this network, together with the provision of a protected environment for early data sharing, will exploit these biological synergies.  By interrogating mechanisms that lead from infection to disease, we will be able to develop common vaccine development strategies for these and other complex intracellular pathogens.",7,,485,485,Intracellular parasite; Intensive care medicine; Leishmaniasis; Disease; Melioidosis; Leprosy; Tuberculosis; Vaccine evaluation; Clinical trial; Medicine,TB; Tuberculosis; intracellular; leishmaniasis; leprosy; melioidosis; neglected; vaccine,,,Medical Research Council (MC_PC_17218) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/P024661/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/R005850/1) United Kingdom,https://core.ac.uk/display/156872441 http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/130035/ https://f1000research.com/articles/7-485/v1/pdf https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/validate(994cef17-b274-4dc7-839e-5fa5b333dd0d).html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29904595 https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/130035/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29904595/ https://f1000research.com/articles/7-485 https://www.jenner.ac.uk/publications/858821 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4648174/ https://doaj.org/article/81e9dccdef394b8ea1d7097182dc19a6 https://f1000research.com/articles/7-485/v1/xml https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29904595 http://repository.ias.ac.in/123577/ https://www.immunology.ox.ac.uk/publications/858821 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5974572 https://core.ac.uk/download/156872441.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.14386.1,29904595,10.12688/f1000research.14386.1,2799385881,PMC5974572,0,000-200-368-655-934; 011-448-408-958-189; 016-683-303-326-355; 021-346-298-564-837; 032-013-140-959-023; 043-976-464-340-711; 044-479-231-373-829; 070-780-763-114-495,1

This paper considers whether the way such research is organised and delivered lends itself to the aims of RRI. We focus particularly on international consortia, which have emerged as a common model to organise large-scale, multi-disciplinary research in contemporary biomedical science. Typically, these consortia operate through fixed-term contracts, and employ governance frameworks consisting of reasonably standard, modular components such as management committees, advisory boards, and data access committees, to co-ordinate the activities of partner institutions and align them with funding agency priorities. These have advantages for organisation and management of the research, but can actively inhibit researchers seeking to implement RRI activities. Conventional consortia governance structures pose specific problems for meaningful public and participant involvement, data sharing, transparency, and 'legacy' planning to deal with societal commitments that persist beyond the duration of the original project. In particular, the 'upstream' negotiation of contractual terms between funders and the institutions employing researchers can undermine the ability for those researchers to subsequently make decisions about data, or participant remuneration, or indeed what happens to consortia outputs after the project is finished, and can inhibit attempts to make project activities and goals responsive to input from ongoing dialogue with various stakeholders. Having explored these challenges, we make some recommendations for alternative consortia governance structures to better support RRI in future.",16,1,13,13,Business; Social responsibility; Public engagement; Remuneration; Responsible Research and Innovation; Clinical governance; Data sharing; European union; Corporate governance; Public relations,Consortia; Data sharing; Governance; Public engagement; Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI); Stakeholders; Transparency,"Clinical Governance; Ethics, Research; Europe; Humans; Research Design; Social Responsibility",,Wellcome Trust (096599/2/11/Z) United Kingdom; Leverhulme Trust (RPG-2017-330); Innovative Medicines Initiative (115439); Innovative Medicines Initiative (115317),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33190636/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667809 https://lsspjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40504-020-00109-z https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33190636 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40504-020-00109-z https://www.scilit.net/article/fa8f519a9306098a5bd2fa0aba81ded2 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1480200-governance-of-research-consortia--challenges-of-implementing-responsible-research-and-innovation-within-europe https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40504-020-00109-z.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33190636 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/1145974,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40504-020-00109-z,33190636,10.1186/s40504-020-00109-z,3106194622,PMC7667809,0,000-243-420-696-005; 001-590-222-771-062; 004-451-799-290-190; 007-040-573-230-040; 010-106-575-285-587; 011-127-307-788-208; 011-849-072-965-568; 012-459-775-309-850; 015-399-424-215-446; 018-460-854-153-475; 018-474-031-363-591; 022-526-129-975-007; 025-449-822-189-330; 026-669-345-397-102; 027-088-747-080-280; 033-418-061-952-773; 034-006-316-493-317; 035-865-406-015-855; 038-521-105-642-53X; 039-632-450-308-717; 041-564-618-204-429; 044-796-817-600-274; 050-361-356-070-462; 051-032-645-723-887; 053-064-014-445-920; 053-532-927-938-206; 057-506-952-128-797; 058-213-738-043-167; 060-592-324-416-634; 064-443-874-974-952; 070-462-022-251-464; 073-109-819-986-646; 077-958-767-002-917; 078-414-922-054-081; 080-890-380-543-727; 084-185-312-722-08X; 087-699-674-300-607; 091-486-082-949-600; 092-888-875-531-595; 098-772-199-622-232; 099-070-179-692-479; 099-481-636-147-238; 110-542-201-197-159; 116-842-174-821-19X; 123-235-929-805-286; 124-852-324-570-875; 140-507-931-893-361; 158-750-365-195-561; 165-817-868-647-600; 175-597-078-467-761,2

Isaacs; Tim Rapley,"Background; Newspaper stories can impact behaviours, particularly in relation to research participation. It is therefore important to understand the narratives presented and ways in which these are received. Some work to date assumes journalism transmits existing medical knowledge to a passive audience. This study aimed to explore how newspaper articles present stories about medical research and how people interpret and use them.; ; Design; Qualitative research methods were employed to analyse two data sets: newspaper articles relating to ‘rheumatoid arthritis’ and ‘research’ from UK local and national news sources; and existing transcripts of interviews with patients with rheumatoid arthritis and their carers.; ; Results; Newspapers present a positive account of medical research, through a simple narrative with three essential components: an ‘innovation’ offers ‘hope’ in the context of ‘burden’. Patients frequently feature as passive subjects without attributed opinions. Few articles include patients’ experiences of research involvement. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and their carers read articles about medical research critically, often with cynicism and drawing on other sources for interpretation.; ; Conclusions; An understanding of the simple, positive narrative of medical research found in newspaper articles may enable researchers to gain mass media exposure for their work and challenge this typical style of reporting. The critical and cynical ways patients and carers read stories about medical research suggest that concerns about newspaper articles misinforming the public may be overstated, but any effect on research engagement is unknown. Newspaper articles rarely present patients’ views or their experiences of research, and this can be conceptualized as ‘depersonalization bias’.",20,2,309,320,Journalism; Psychology; Qualitative research; Narrative; Newspaper; Cynicism; Context (language use); Newspapers as Topic; Social science; Medical education; Mass media,arthritis; health research; mass media; newspaper; patient narrative; research participation,"Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy; Biomedical Research; Drugs, Investigational; Humans; Newspapers as Topic; Qualitative Research; United Kingdom","Drugs, Investigational",Arthritis Research UK (20018) United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27145430/ https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/106879826/Hanson_et_al_2017_Health_Expectations.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/157831825 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/hex.12460 https://researchportal.northumbria.ac.uk/en/publications/drug-breakthrough-offers-hope-to-arthritis-sufferers-qualitative- https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/912180 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/hex.12460 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5354054 https://northumbria-test.eprints-hosting.org/id/document/267271 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27145430 http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/hex.12460 https://core.ac.uk/download/157854072.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hex.12460,27145430,10.1111/hex.12460,2346157744,PMC5354054,0,004-915-954-163-11X; 006-030-220-513-146; 007-200-253-872-44X; 018-245-814-749-416; 028-991-832-894-489; 029-291-215-853-218; 030-230-995-225-269; 034-332-824-201-484; 037-102-979-151-536; 037-484-642-128-927; 041-951-576-009-755; 045-109-089-241-259; 049-113-898-826-721; 051-761-229-928-031; 057-243-720-552-466; 060-978-206-095-448; 092-520-919-678-172; 096-563-696-607-371; 098-786-895-036-381; 110-472-903-041-991; 115-351-578-040-370; 123-968-533-756-885; 132-444-737-016-722; 132-906-118-481-67X; 135-697-793-999-932; 149-064-002-861-397; 156-969-907-314-929; 183-062-821-189-796; 187-837-117-851-092; 193-464-576-103-550; 199-814-143-482-159,6

The Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) is the core structure of intelligent vehicles. It ensures the accuracy and security of communication in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) modes to enhance road safety and decrease traffic congestion. However, VANET is subject to security vulnerabilities such as denial-of-service (DoS), replay attacks and Sybil attacks that may undermine the security and privacy of the network. Such issues may lead to the transmission of incorrect information from a malicious node to other nodes in the network. In this paper, we present a biometrics blockchain (BBC) framework to secure data sharing among vehicles in VANET and to retain statuary data in a conventional and trusted system. In the proposed framework, we take advantage of biometric information to keep a record of the genuine identity of the message sender, thus preserving privacy. Therefore, the proposed BBC scheme establishes security and trust between vehicles in VANET alongside the capacity to trace identities whenever required. Simulations in OMNeT++, veins and SUMO were carried out to demonstrate the viability of the proposed framework using the urban mobility model. The performance of the framework is evaluated in terms of packet delivery rate, packet loss rate and computational cost. The results show that our novel model is superior to existing approaches.",9,,87299,87309,Replay attack; Network packet; Authentication; Vehicular ad hoc network; Traffic congestion; Data sharing; Trusted system; Computer security; Computer science; Node (networking),,,,Strengthening Accountability Networks among Civil Society; The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Leverhulme Trust,https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3086225 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/access/access9.html#AlharthiNJ21 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/156034/?template=browse https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9446888,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3086225,,10.1109/access.2021.3086225,3168851296,,0,014-448-058-704-128; 016-136-864-797-920; 017-706-900-109-135; 024-360-011-934-037; 025-107-595-840-313; 034-715-307-988-547; 040-820-826-303-10X; 040-856-613-005-090; 040-933-537-783-929; 041-827-841-387-75X; 042-498-631-309-640; 044-413-523-627-905; 045-037-083-264-257; 046-137-626-558-601; 051-215-978-962-394; 051-329-819-498-518; 053-169-501-734-739; 053-502-065-540-220; 054-079-583-763-10X; 060-894-719-034-634; 063-091-301-422-808; 066-471-576-694-769; 067-186-826-345-662; 069-644-859-416-883; 076-772-807-135-174; 081-049-429-961-935; 082-913-815-065-165; 082-963-514-100-663; 093-698-603-416-680; 096-091-715-269-337; 096-590-621-871-921; 099-010-410-958-352; 115-574-855-275-847; 132-820-463-501-267; 141-605-047-661-813; 149-010-547-839-946,1

Sebire,"Objectives The value of healthcare data is being increasingly recognised, including the need to improve health dataset utility. There is no established mechanism for evaluating healthcare dataset utility making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of activities improving the data. To describe the method for generating and involving the user community in developing a proposed framework for evaluation and communication of healthcare dataset utility for given research areas. Methods An initial version of a matrix to review datasets across a range of dimensions was developed based on previous published findings regarding healthcare data. This was used to initiate a design process through interviews and surveys with data users representing a broad range of user types and use cases, to help develop a focused framework for characterising datasets. Results Following 21 interviews, 31 survey responses and testing on 43 datasets, five major categories and 13 subcategories were identified as useful for a dataset, including Data Model, Completeness and Linkage. Each sub-category was graded to facilitate rapid and reproducible evaluation of dataset utility for specific use-cases. Testing of applicability to >40 existing datasets demonstrated potential usefulness for subsequent evaluation in real-world practice. Discussion The research has developed an evidenced-based initial approach for a framework to understand the utility of a healthcare dataset. It is likely to require further refinement following wider application and additional categories may be required. Conclusion The process has resulted in a user-centred designed framework for objectively evaluating the likely utility of specific healthcare datasets, and therefore, should be of value both for potential users of health data, and for data custodians to identify the areas to provide the optimal value for data curation investment.",28,1,e100303,,Information management; Health care; Information system; Data science; Use case; Computer science; Process (engineering); Data curation; Data model; Information science,BMJ health informatics; health care sector; information management; information science; information systems,Artificial Intelligence; Data Curation; Delivery of Health Care/organization & administration; Drug Industry/organization & administration; Humans; Medical Informatics/organization & administration; State Medicine/organization & administration; United Kingdom,,Medical Research Council,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33980500 http://informatics.bmj.com/content/28/1/e100303 https://informatics.bmj.com/content/28/1/e100303 https://informatics.bmj.com/content/bmjhci/28/1/e100303.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8117992 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33980500,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjhci-2020-100303,33980500,10.1136/bmjhci-2020-100303,3160133564,PMC8117992,0,000-537-027-515-865; 009-565-436-209-186; 018-060-365-385-969; 022-802-182-665-815; 023-710-948-183-771; 034-281-353-667-511; 043-351-768-269-117; 080-693-860-693-860; 102-284-671-422-091; 112-695-677-538-975; 140-705-023-791-164; 173-374-800-143-617; 183-104-833-559-603,0

Howe; Nathalie Brackmann; Tom Smeets,"Among many legal professionals and memory researchers there exists the assumption that susceptibility to false memory decreases with age. In 4 misinformation experiments, we show that under conditions that focus on the meaning of experiences, children are not always the most susceptible to suggestion-induced false memories. We begin by presenting a short overview of previous developmental false memory studies, the majority of which have found that the susceptibility to misinformation decreases with age. In Experiment 1, 6/7-year-olds, 11/12-year-olds, and adults received a video and were confronted with misinformation about related but nonpresented details. Older children and adults had higher misinformation acceptance rates than younger children. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding adding a younger child group (4/6-year-olds). In Experiments 3 and 4, we used new material and again found that susceptibility to misinformation increased with age. Together, these experiments show that children's memory accuracy is not necessarily inferior to that of adults.'",145,1,31,55,Memory errors; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Visual perception; Cognitive psychology; Illusion; Misinformation; Cognitive inhibition; Memory development; False memory; Eyewitness memory,,"Adolescent; Age Factors; Attention; Child; Child, Preschool; Emotions; Female; Humans; Illusions/psychology; Male; Mental Recall; Pilot Projects; Repression, Psychology; Suggestion; Video Recording; Visual Perception; Young Adult",,Edmund Hustinx Foundation; Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research; Economic and Social Research Council,https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4694095 https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/the-malleability-of-developmental-trends-in-neutral-and-negative- https://philpapers.org/rec/OTGTMO https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/12671/ https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-58122-002 http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/xge0000127 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4694095/ https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/ws/files/8184179/1602509.pdf https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/portal/en/publications/the-malleability-of-developmental-trends-in-neutral-and-negative-memory-illusions(cfe9f102-cd67-49c8-ab61-adca43781812)/export.html https://core.ac.uk/display/76981322 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26709588/ https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/the-malleability-of-developmental-trends-in-neutral-and-negative- https://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/xge0000127 https://core.ac.uk/download/76981322.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000127,26709588,10.1037/xge0000127,2303836766,PMC4694095,0,002-832-023-018-276; 003-076-480-917-424; 003-209-741-236-384; 003-408-865-715-717; 004-249-228-985-213; 005-123-983-217-00X; 009-722-593-005-829; 010-645-131-565-740; 010-855-204-733-123; 010-935-099-894-522; 011-050-073-386-050; 012-130-921-052-149; 012-475-357-662-352; 013-427-858-993-301; 014-460-375-860-169; 014-902-486-087-020; 015-715-511-123-349; 016-594-833-938-127; 018-655-948-018-645; 021-347-628-427-347; 022-299-626-647-445; 022-742-813-198-271; 022-912-814-811-575; 023-902-548-706-226; 025-613-302-731-212; 026-528-779-240-832; 027-939-443-771-78X; 028-640-345-079-319; 028-799-605-530-634; 029-742-022-717-455; 030-381-777-532-656; 031-220-069-750-790; 031-489-925-651-667; 032-049-177-406-929; 033-747-461-692-488; 034-150-438-443-306; 034-724-681-447-243; 035-888-646-455-43X; 036-321-473-311-663; 036-724-005-862-348; 037-159-895-935-680; 037-397-006-521-917; 037-639-130-860-480; 037-917-073-328-697; 039-514-048-224-833; 039-675-535-915-356; 042-430-248-024-553; 043-333-419-978-530; 043-471-425-716-647; 044-154-690-534-411; 044-492-309-080-927; 044-666-729-485-59X; 046-243-812-882-439; 046-582-550-671-880; 048-789-664-354-50X; 049-953-906-092-88X; 052-071-826-627-251; 052-402-456-282-092; 055-853-583-619-868; 056-187-644-283-400; 058-728-431-395-160; 060-260-566-120-78X; 060-594-057-455-979; 061-565-321-369-214; 061-577-273-668-997; 063-377-314-542-36X; 064-913-385-177-251; 066-099-450-104-411; 067-557-602-962-354; 070-455-286-668-145; 070-684-324-689-764; 071-056-517-157-114; 071-296-819-250-632; 072-093-453-022-753; 074-909-435-754-442; 076-701-704-047-886; 076-819-857-837-065; 079-009-942-073-973; 082-570-308-609-402; 086-306-274-567-322; 088-134-703-783-889; 088-315-803-012-822; 091-411-920-496-510; 091-794-616-738-985; 092-256-238-029-273; 095-334-281-757-022; 095-441-629-844-738; 096-435-393-638-692; 097-678-847-354-372; 098-332-356-401-611; 098-767-319-842-71X; 099-779-752-778-119; 102-639-466-518-342; 105-051-287-138-83X; 105-504-607-840-353; 107-402-990-720-519; 109-281-022-313-515; 121-614-857-639-588; 122-133-872-698-470; 126-063-120-265-335; 129-374-923-544-984; 130-570-986-103-83X; 134-191-330-828-964; 134-828-466-767-713; 141-506-989-073-94X; 156-804-751-953-007; 160-370-382-511-674; 163-623-411-074-234; 183-522-924-992-797; 186-910-759-520-49X,41

Datta; Stephen McIntosh; Barry Warden; Simon Bateson; Fathi Abugchem; Zulfiqur Ali,"Absorption is a widely used technique for a range of different applications. It has lower sensitivity than many other techniques such as fluorescence which has 100 to 1000 times higher sensitivity than absorption. Optical cavity approaches have been developed where the light passes back and forth, within the sample, between two high reflectivity mirrors to increase the pathlength and sensitivity. These approaches have not yet, however, been widely used for analytical applications and for point-of-care diagnostics. Here we show a portable cavity enhanced absorption (CEA) spectrometer and a low cost point-of-care (POC) reader with CEA detection with mechanical elements fabricated using 3D printing. The CEA spectrometer can be used in both single pass and multi-pass cavity enhanced mode to provide measurements in the visible region that are very sensitive and over a wide dynamic range. The CEA mode was shown for Rhodamine B dye to increase the pathlength 57.8 fold over single pass measurements and an LOD of 7.1 × 10-11 M. The cost of the CEA POC reader was reduced by use of narrow band LEDs, photodiodes and removal of fibre optic coupling and with a 14 fold increase in the pathlength over conventional single pass microplate readers. The CEA POC reader was demonstrated for immunoassay of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT) and Interleukin 6 (IL-6), towards a three biomarker panel to aid the diagnosis of sepsis. The CEA POC reader can be integrated with wireless connectivity for cloud based data sharing.

In Mexico, HTN prevalence has increased over time and is currently 31%. Nonetheless, information about the country9s HTN incidence and its associated risk factors is scarce. Understanding this condition is a priority for identifying the scope of primary prevention. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of traditional and non-traditional risk factors on the incidence of HTN in a cohort of healthy Mexico City residents under biannual follow-up for 10 years. Methods and analysis A prospective longitudinal study is proposed in which clinically healthy residents of Mexico City between 20 and 50 years old will be recruited; the participants will be evaluated every 2 years over a period of 10 years or until they develop HTN. Evaluations regarding sociodemographic, clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, diet, physical activity, stress, sleep quality, alcohol and tobacco consumption factors will be performed. The participants will be recruited from the 16 municipalities of Mexico City through promotional strategies aimed at the community and will be clinically evaluated at a tertiary care institution, Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia Ignacio Chavez (National Institute of Cardiology Ignacio Chavez), located in Mexico City, Mexico. Sample size estimated for this study is 3436, and the Cox proportional hazards model will be used to estimate HRs for the association between explanatory variables and HTN using both raw and adjusted data. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by the Institutional Bioethics Committee of the Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia Ignacio Chavez (National Institute of Cardiology Ignacio Chavez) under number 13-802.

Although described more than a century ago, challenges in comprehensive disease management and collaborative research on this disease are compounded by the complex molecular and clinical phenotypes of SCD, environmental and psychosocial factors, limited therapeutic options and ambiguous terminology. This ambiguous terminology has hampered the integration and interoperability of existing SCD knowledge, and SCD research translation. The SCD Ontology (SCDO), which is a community-driven integrative and universal knowledge representation system for SCD, overcomes this issue by providing a controlled vocabulary developed by a group of experts in both SCD and ontology design. SCDO is the first and most comprehensive standardized human- and machine-readable resource that unambiguously represents terminology and concepts about SCD for researchers, patients and clinicians. It is built around the central concept 'hemoglobinopathy', allowing inclusion of non-SCD haemoglobinopathies, such as thalassaemias, which may interfere with or influence SCD phenotypic manifestations. This collaboratively developed ontology constitutes a comprehensive knowledge management system and standardized terminology of various SCD-related factors. The SCDO will promote interoperability of different research datasets, facilitate seamless data sharing and collaborations, including meta-analyses within the SCD community, and support the development and curation of data-basing and clinical informatics in SCD.",2019,,,,Cell; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Disease Ontology; Cell based; Computational biology; Medicine,,"Anemia, Sickle Cell/pathology; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Knowledge Bases; Phenotype",,NHGRI NIH HHS (U24 HG006941) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U54 HG009790) United States; NHLBI NIH HHS (U24 HL135600) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U01 HG009716) United States; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (H3A/18/001 ) United Kingdom,https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/21575 https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/baz118/5626537,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/database/baz118,31769834,10.1093/database/baz118,3027553965,PMC6878945,0,001-273-782-807-589; 002-479-486-577-678; 002-814-118-735-340; 007-679-327-173-527; 008-456-754-035-434; 009-811-435-795-217; 014-531-754-961-176; 015-252-510-383-394; 015-256-783-531-549; 015-910-375-733-479; 015-940-125-471-573; 017-843-059-428-902; 022-931-003-028-249; 024-645-901-447-985; 024-750-186-440-569; 036-491-469-804-985; 038-600-923-148-328; 042-902-474-331-490; 045-487-296-865-724; 047-843-912-914-122; 051-848-709-463-327; 069-192-683-790-649; 078-343-721-298-375; 078-729-078-292-59X; 080-032-275-012-464; 081-510-335-979-475; 089-172-233-622-418; 089-273-670-266-864; 101-451-065-147-033; 111-611-501-738-466; 113-708-192-490-201; 114-979-001-375-35X; 127-982-466-222-045; 131-939-614-348-688; 137-459-168-396-270; 140-362-538-070-698; 149-240-478-717-892; 149-423-530-241-847; 177-297-863-120-577; 179-880-978-852-250,8

Tabak; Mika Kivimäki; Archana Singh-Manoux; Séverine Sabia,"This work examined the role of physical activity in the course of diabetes using data spanning nearly three decades. Our first aim was to examine the long-term association of moderate and vigorous physical activity with incidence of type 2 diabetes. Our second aim was to investigate the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity post-diabetes diagnosis with subsequent risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. A total of 9987 participants from the Whitehall II cohort study free of type 2 diabetes at baseline (1985–1988) were followed for incidence of type 2 diabetes, based on clinical assessments between 1985 and 2016 and linkage to electronic health records up to 31 March 2017. We first examined the association of moderate and vigorous physical activity measured by questionnaire in 1985–1988 (mean age 44.9 [SD 6.0] years; women, 32.7%) with incident type 2 diabetes, using the interval-censored, illness–death model, a competing risk analysis that takes into account both competing risk of death and intermittent ascertainment of diabetes due to reliance on data collection cycles (interval-censored). The second analysis was based on individuals with type 2 diabetes over the follow-up period where we used Cox regression with inverse probability weighting to examine the association of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with risk of all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. Of the 9987 participants, 1553 developed type 2 diabetes during a mean follow-up of 27.1 (SD 6.3) years. Compared with participants who were inactive in 1985–1988, those who undertook any duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.75, 0.97], p = 0.02; analysis adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioural and health-related factors). In 1026 participants with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes over the follow-up period, data on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity after diabetes diagnosis were available; 165 all-cause deaths and 55 cardiovascular disease-related deaths were recorded during a mean follow-up of 8.8 (SD 6.1) years. In these participants with diabetes, any duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR 0.61 [95% CI 0.41, 0.93], p = 0.02) while the association with cardiovascular mortality was evident only for physical activity undertaken at or above recommendations (≥2.5 h per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or ≥1.25 h per week of vigorous physical activity; HR 0.40 [95% CI 0.16, 0.96], p = 0.04) in fully adjusted models. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity plays an important role in diabetes, influencing both its incidence and prognosis. A protective effect on incidence was seen for durations of activity below recommendations and a marginal additional benefit was observed at higher durations.

The 99mTc-HMPAO was injected (intravenously, 225 MBq) during pCASL acquisition. The pCASL and 99mTc-HMPAO autoradiography CBF measures, relative to the contralateral hemisphere, were in good agreement across the spectrum of flow values in normal and ischemic tissues. The pCASL-derived quantitative regional CBF values (contralateral: 157 to 177 mL/100 g per minute; ipsilateral: 9 to 104 mL/100 g per minute) were consistent with the literature values.

Sanchez-Bornot; Paddy Gillespie; Stephen Todd; David P. Finn; Alok Joshi; Joseph Kane; Bernadette McGuinness,"Dementia is caused by a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and is associated with a decline in memory and other cognitive abilities, while inflicting an enormous socioeconomic burden. The complexity of dementia and its associated comorbidities presents immense challenges for dementia research and care, particularly in clinical decision-making. Despite the lack of disease-modifying therapies, there is an increasing and urgent need to make timely and accurate clinical decisions in dementia diagnosis and prognosis to allow appropriate care and treatment. However, the dementia care pathway is currently suboptimal. We propose that through computational approaches, understanding of dementia aetiology could be improved, and dementia assessments could be more standardised, objective and efficient. In particular, we suggest that these will involve appropriate data infrastructure, the use of data-driven computational neurology approaches and the development of practical clinical decision support systems. We also discuss the technical, structural, economic, political and policy-making challenges that accompany such implementations. The data-driven era for dementia research has arrived with the potential to transform the healthcare system, creating a more efficient, transparent and personalised service for dementia.",18,1,398,,Variety (cybernetics); Socioeconomic status; Neurology; Cognition; Intensive care medicine; Implementation; Dementia; Service (systems architecture); Clinical decision support system; Medicine,Alzheimer’s disease; Clinical decision support systems; Computational modelling; Computational neurology; Computational neuroscience; Data science; Dementia; Dementia care pathway; Healthcare economics,"Big Data/supply & distribution; Comorbidity; Computational Biology/methods; Critical Pathways/organization & administration; Data Science/methods; Databases, Factual/supply & distribution; Dementia/epidemiology; Humans; Neurology/methods",,"Interreg (Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB; Centre for Personalised Medicine, IVA 5036)); Northern Ireland Functional Brain Mapping Project Facility (1303/101154803); Ulster University (Research Challenge Fund)",https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01841-1 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-020-01841-1 https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/225842645/shaping.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7738245 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12916-020-01841-1.pdf https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/shaping-a-data-driven-era-in-dementia-care-pathway-through-comput https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/shaping-a-data-driven-era-in-dementia-care-pathway-through-comput https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33323116,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01841-1,33323116,10.1186/s12916-020-01841-1,3104107797,PMC7738245,0,001-967-781-113-637; 002-448-622-330-863; 003-178-636-412-033; 004-080-901-544-055; 004-587-829-349-062; 004-804-300-992-101; 005-866-706-830-540; 006-017-529-570-468; 006-508-850-478-015; 006-660-538-766-780; 007-149-555-886-176; 007-205-646-834-359; 008-284-045-729-005; 008-410-465-262-864; 008-553-526-657-789; 008-575-432-667-078; 009-013-977-916-320; 009-941-473-795-942; 012-947-370-605-398; 014-364-909-577-115; 017-561-275-172-723; 017-706-866-701-37X; 018-092-657-303-933; 018-650-230-447-392; 021-197-566-514-822; 021-322-794-916-41X; 021-583-001-034-093; 023-726-330-106-682; 023-740-450-237-071; 023-989-056-690-162; 024-134-016-360-524; 024-665-574-804-823; 025-419-104-329-346; 026-640-029-571-640; 027-047-789-560-388; 029-373-804-401-972; 029-709-163-331-922; 030-709-838-876-388; 031-318-630-137-859; 032-155-592-693-08X; 032-189-313-094-902; 032-836-594-201-02X; 033-154-741-544-582; 035-895-645-483-91X; 036-827-417-142-103; 038-977-292-198-280; 043-283-962-300-761; 043-754-599-770-782; 044-050-694-558-22X; 044-108-362-409-040; 045-587-826-074-427; 048-032-196-234-421; 048-333-823-751-444; 050-687-516-299-646; 051-649-464-394-009; 054-018-148-403-936; 056-289-959-975-61X; 056-572-928-702-698; 057-419-801-323-004; 059-149-073-001-124; 059-810-591-959-956; 059-855-602-225-448; 060-861-204-038-07X; 061-868-219-011-863; 062-091-265-904-175; 062-651-962-171-504; 062-875-033-710-131; 065-027-508-707-786; 065-032-619-272-902; 065-639-904-489-474; 071-515-217-383-152; 071-755-063-231-983; 072-189-969-355-344; 074-835-217-027-221; 078-701-300-592-362; 081-927-929-243-557; 084-453-487-065-34X; 086-873-869-877-566; 089-372-510-999-077; 089-527-638-996-928; 098-447-659-448-548; 099-331-387-163-267; 104-653-254-651-487; 110-625-632-049-215; 112-646-960-706-953; 113-364-267-659-504; 115-976-756-863-776; 117-705-159-482-308; 121-105-098-779-938; 121-450-282-387-667; 121-991-461-060-995; 122-092-863-546-055; 131-067-475-711-532; 149-585-699-014-836; 161-694-863-238-418; 169-050-451-795-346; 176-333-057-156-646; 186-603-600-778-579,5

Noam,"This chapter examines the impacts of the digital economy on employment, the drivers of change, and the options to alleviate the emerging problems. The digital economy was supposed to replace and enhance industrial jobs, but it has also accelerated the outmigration of blue-collar and service jobs, with only inadequate replacements. The impact on different income classes and generational levels has been unequal. Midpay jobs decreased while low- and high-skilled jobs rose. The chapter then discusses the economic fundamentals that shape the digital economy–highly concentrated, capital intensive, volatile, and unstable–and the consequences for digital firms and their management. They can expect new waves of political disputes, government policies, and labor unrest. Instead of claiming to be the solution and arguing that identifying a problem reflects an anti-technology Luddism, the sector would be wise to recommend, support, and finance public and private actions. Otherwise, the backlash will create forces that will restrict innovation.",,,117,140,Economic policy; Public policy; Capital intensity; Economics; Digital economy; Unrest; restrict; Service (economics); Inequality; Politics,,,,"International Development Research Centre; Department for International Development, UK Government; LIRNEasia",https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78420-5_8 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78420-5_8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78420-5_8,,10.1007/978-3-319-78420-5_8,2802206079,,0,002-905-999-681-824; 009-778-723-493-019; 023-597-182-871-295; 024-086-607-434-35X; 024-471-109-180-175; 037-998-198-260-718; 039-648-014-566-441; 044-734-616-115-738; 058-932-774-059-554; 063-922-559-543-185; 065-022-223-799-995; 065-976-757-056-237; 073-766-387-055-564; 076-949-709-018-776; 084-888-169-948-705; 091-446-076-612-44X; 103-647-924-493-303; 104-292-627-025-008; 118-430-463-163-48X; 119-770-359-884-276; 128-588-758-657-834; 151-507-408-938-472,0

However, most existing tools for sharing biometric data lock researchers into vendor-specific solutions that cannot be easily adapted to the specific researchers' requirements, users' needs and ethical considerations. To mitigate this, we investigate the requirements for open source researcher-oriented biometric data sharing systems. Requirements were captured using: first-hand insights from two prototype deployments, a systematic review of the literature, and interviews with HCI researchers who have built such tools. The requirements thus captured were implemented in the BioShare system and insights from implementing these requirements are presented. BioShare allows users both to share data but also receive inputs from remote viewers of the data in real-time.

To overcome the limitations of previous meta-analyses inherent to the use of aggregate data, we will perform an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA) on the effect of hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone compared with placebo or usual care on 90-day mortality and other outcomes in patients with septic shock.Methods and analysisTo assess the benefits and risks of hydrocortisone, with or without fludrocortisone for adults with septic shock, we will search major electronic databases from inception to September 2020 (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), complimented by a search for unpublished trials. The primary analysis will compare hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone to placebo or no treatment in adult patients with septic shock. Secondary analyses will compare hydrocortisone to placebo (or usual care), hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone to placebo (or usual care), and hydrocortisone versus hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone. The primary outcome will be all cause mortality at 90 days. We will conduct both one-stage IPDMA using mixed-effect models and machine learning with targeted maximum likelihood analyses. We will assess the risk of bias related to unshared data and related to the quality of individual trial.Ethics and disseminationThis IPDMA will use existing data from completed randomised clinical trials and will comply with the ethical and regulatory requirements regarding data sharing for each of the component trials. The findings of this study will be submitted for publication in a peer-review journal with straightforward policy for open access.Prospero registration numberCRD42017062198.",10,12,e040931,,Intensive care medicine; Placebo; Fludrocortisone; Septic shock; MEDLINE; Biomedical sciences; Clinical trial; Clinical pharmacology; Medicine; Meta-analysis,adult intensive & critical care; clinical pharmacology; clinical trials,"Adult; Caribbean Region; Fludrocortisone/therapeutic use; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Shock, Septic/drug therapy",Fludrocortisone; Hydrocortisone,Department of Health (NIHR/CS/009/007) United Kingdom; Department of Health (PB-PG-0610-22350) United Kingdom; Department of Health (RP-2015-06-018) United Kingdom,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/10/12/e040931.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7713227 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:9e78d10 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/0vf6x9vp https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33268422 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33268422/ https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/12/e040931 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03109140,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040931,33268422,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040931,3107538338,PMC7713227,0,000-924-183-805-215; 001-036-904-333-352; 003-168-165-791-540; 003-779-782-141-984; 005-487-686-997-772; 006-147-108-019-016; 006-390-740-370-395; 006-782-636-400-809; 006-939-434-499-321; 007-430-371-797-747; 008-747-365-741-431; 016-185-168-724-649; 017-409-943-630-86X; 020-693-060-497-814; 028-865-768-454-173; 029-390-458-527-832; 034-146-994-601-000; 034-288-701-526-224; 036-404-202-655-986; 041-358-621-904-63X; 041-650-017-267-88X; 049-180-495-796-169; 049-240-409-396-698; 050-260-636-209-964; 050-609-255-785-561; 051-826-686-234-072; 064-843-808-795-318; 067-096-415-976-954; 071-219-201-364-591; 072-516-841-671-300; 074-022-809-886-38X; 074-267-159-734-59X; 080-796-419-663-830; 082-037-185-972-598; 088-860-988-162-782; 094-682-409-109-441; 114-946-414-234-183; 116-661-965-783-908; 125-324-540-866-950; 134-189-660-446-261; 136-282-350-006-593; 146-740-615-959-946; 155-953-485-674-461; 156-256-401-071-608,0

They include the escalating costs of research and lower research productivity, low public trust in researchers to report the truth, lack of diversity, poor community engagement, ethical concerns over research practices, and irreproducibility. Open science (OS) collaborations comprise of a set of practices including open access publication, open data sharing and the absence of restrictive intellectual property rights with which institutions, firms, governments and communities are experimenting in order to overcome these concerns. We gathered two groups of international representatives from a large variety of stakeholders to construct a toolkit to guide and facilitate data collection about OS and non-OS collaborations. Ultimately, the toolkit will be used to assess and study the impact of OS collaborations on research and innovation. The toolkit contains the following four elements: 1) an annual report form of quantitative data to be completed by OS partnership administrators; 2) a series of semi-structured interview guides of stakeholders; 3) a survey form of participants in OS collaborations; and 4) a set of other quantitative measures best collected by other organizations, such as research foundations and governmental or intergovernmental agencies. We opened our toolkit to community comment and input. We present the resulting toolkit for use by government and philanthropic grantors, institutions, researchers and community organizations with the aim of measuring the implementation and impact of OS partnership across these organizations. We invite these and other stakeholders to not only measure, but to share the resulting data so that social scientists and policy makers can analyse the data across projects.",3,,1442,1442,Government; Political science; Community engagement; Public trust; Open science; Open data; Intellectual property; Public relations; Community organization; General partnership,Open science; impact; implementation; indicator; innovation; intellectual property; partnership; performance; policy; toolkit,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6904887 http://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/3-1442 https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/3-1442 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31850398 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31850398/ https://osf.io/wmpqb/ https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/an-open-toolkit-for-tracking-open-science-partnership-implementat https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/3-1442/v1/xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.12958.2,31850398,10.12688/gatesopenres.12958.2,2942740451,PMC6904887,0,002-087-310-019-418; 003-735-457-147-034; 004-598-468-485-299; 007-781-992-937-68X; 008-723-239-340-841; 011-043-772-477-132; 012-915-798-531-231; 015-567-817-927-719; 016-609-778-174-898; 022-446-703-174-889; 022-641-732-553-339; 023-442-434-747-228; 026-125-810-364-184; 029-172-707-879-21X; 030-750-475-174-874; 031-492-701-769-110; 033-665-715-577-238; 033-799-988-970-717; 037-816-060-391-328; 038-908-827-470-676; 039-230-773-017-015; 042-471-160-188-861; 049-131-976-253-519; 053-191-513-385-944; 056-339-493-729-152; 061-835-666-266-349; 062-203-320-082-121; 063-168-945-944-620; 067-192-279-737-819; 068-928-335-495-582; 078-684-856-123-930; 082-161-860-970-78X; 082-360-529-001-278; 094-500-268-979-40X; 102-295-660-352-052; 103-200-671-655-528; 105-814-767-296-004; 112-456-249-896-452; 115-236-108-351-437; 127-547-171-875-173; 159-990-110-465-178; 174-342-704-076-67X; 190-767-711-092-401; 194-208-613-133-841,10

But research that analyzes large aggregate data sets, possibly including detailed clinical and genomic information of individuals, may require different assessment. At the same time, growth in international data-sharing collaborations adds stress to a system already under fire for subjecting multisite research to replicate ethics reviews, which can inhibit research without improving the quality of human subjects' protections ( 1 , 2 ). “Top-down” national regulatory approaches exist for ethics review across multiple sites in domestic research projects [e.g., United States ( 3 , 4 ), Canada ( 5 ), United Kingdom, ( 6 ), Australia ( 7 )], but their applicability for data-intensive international research has not been considered. Stakeholders around the world have thus been developing “bottom-up” solutions. We scrutinize five such ef orts involving multiple countries around the world, including resource-poor settings (table S1), to identify models that could inform a framework for mutual recognition of international ethics review (i.e., the acceptance by RECs of the outcome of each other's review).",351,6280,1399,1400,Welfare; Research ethics; Political science; International ethics; Quality (business); Information Dissemination; Datasets as Topic; Public relations; Big data; Information ethics,,"Biomedical Research/ethics; Datasets as Topic/ethics; Ethical Review/standards; Genetics, Medical; Genome, Human; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Internationality; Neoplasms",,Wellcome Trust (099313) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (103360) United Kingdom; NHGRI NIH HHS (U01 HG008226) United States,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016Sci...351.1399D/abstract https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aad5269 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Acris.maastrichtuniversity.nl%3Apublications%2F6bb38f8e-dafc-4db7-bfc9-39b05c2192f8 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/351/6280/1399.full.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4838154 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/111513 https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/1399.full https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/1399 http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6280/1399/tab-pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5739476 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4838154 https://core.ac.uk/display/34660944 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27013718,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aad5269,27013718,10.1126/science.aad5269,2303336601,PMC4838154,0,026-629-559-633-469; 036-882-166-541-127; 052-644-086-395-103; 054-261-014-260-749; 082-148-585-538-178; 084-118-472-094-473; 088-409-920-476-850,37

Beresford,"Ear-worn wearable devices, or earables, are a rapidly emerging sensor platform, with unique opportunities to collect a wide variety of sensor data, and build systems with novel human-computer interaction components. At this point in the development of the field, with projects such as eSense putting hardware in researchers' hands but being limited in reach, the sharing of datasets collected by researchers with the wider community would bring a number of benefits. A central data sharing platform would enable wider participation in earables research and improve the quality of projects, as well as being a vehicle for better data quality and data protection practices. We discuss the considerations behind building such a platform, and propose an architecture that would achieve better privacy-utility trade-offs than many existing data sharing efforts.",,,30,35,Variety (cybernetics); Wearable computer; Ubiquitous computing; Data quality; Data science; Data sharing; Field (computer science); Computer science; Wearable technology; Data Protection Act 1998,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://doi.org/10.1145/3345615.3361139 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/huc/earcomp2019.html#PowarB19 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3345615.3361139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3345615.3361139,,10.1145/3345615.3361139,3008106415,,0,002-880-834-577-764; 019-469-410-953-161; 046-341-915-193-520; 051-976-984-282-949; 068-645-684-902-684,1
2726,039-932-598-715-380,Systematic Literature Review on the Spread of Health-related Misinformation on Social Media,2019-09-18,2019,journal article,Social science & medicine (1982),18735347; 02779536,Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,Yuxi Wang; Martin McKee; Aleksandra Torbica; David Stuckler,"Contemporary commentators describe the current period as ""an era of fake news"" in which misinformation, generated intentionally or unintentionally, spreads rapidly. Although affecting all areas of life, it poses particular problems in the health arena, where it can delay or prevent effective care, in some cases threatening the lives of individuals. While examples of the rapid spread of misinformation date back to the earliest days of scientific medicine, the internet, by allowing instantaneous communication and powerful amplification has brought about a quantum change. In democracies where ideas compete in the marketplace for attention, accurate scientific information, which may be difficult to comprehend and even dull, is easily crowded out by sensationalized news. In order to uncover the current evidence and better understand the mechanism of misinformation spread, we report a systematic review of the nature and potential drivers of health-related misinformation. We searched PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus and Google databases to identify relevant methodological and empirical articles published between 2012 and 2018. A total of 57 articles were included for full-text analysis. Overall, we observe an increasing trend in published articles on health-related misinformation and the role of social media in its propagation. The most extensively studied topics involving misinformation relate to vaccination, Ebola and Zika Virus, although others, such as nutrition, cancer, fluoridation of water and smoking also featured. Studies adopted theoretical frameworks from psychology and network science, while co-citation analysis revealed potential for greater collaboration across fields. Most studies employed content analysis, social network analysis or experiments, drawing on disparate disciplinary paradigms. Future research should examine susceptibility of different sociodemographic groups to misinformation and understand the role of belief systems on the intention to spread misinformation. Further interdisciplinary research is also warranted to identify effective and tailored interventions to counter the spread of health-related misinformation online.",240,,112552,,Internet privacy; The Internet; Social network analysis; Psychology; Content analysis; Systematic review; Misinformation; Social media; News media; Discipline,Fake news; Health; Misinformation; Social media,Communication; Deception; Health Literacy/standards; Humans; Social Media/standards,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953619305465 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4654538/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v240y2019ics0277953619305465.html http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117034/ https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/46c1876f-9545-36ba-81bd-315995dde0db/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7117034/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31561111/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953619305465 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-64035-001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112552,31561111,10.1016/j.socscimed.2019.112552,2974087526,PMC7117034,0,000-667-619-481-684; 000-928-551-581-840; 001-011-237-647-268; 001-039-336-777-767; 001-247-821-736-332; 001-888-106-614-205; 002-052-422-936-00X; 002-908-204-932-858; 003-254-479-923-236; 003-267-210-148-890; 004-397-997-709-891; 004-769-466-059-978; 005-098-430-390-214; 005-656-215-222-561; 006-545-958-048-423; 006-571-680-450-045; 007-129-340-502-042; 008-055-479-816-334; 008-934-449-824-000; 009-954-887-194-728; 010-420-345-602-01X; 010-710-435-385-851; 011-303-061-474-531; 011-488-672-643-908; 011-745-944-216-219; 012-009-173-052-746; 012-558-084-855-16X; 012-955-802-173-243; 013-631-692-819-191; 013-778-278-721-662; 014-064-231-257-163; 015-264-538-059-64X; 015-436-445-423-543; 015-475-547-173-305; 015-826-745-723-509; 017-300-737-144-757; 017-707-334-328-388; 017-811-396-969-068; 017-914-190-738-151; 019-427-467-229-232; 019-506-549-709-761; 020-279-004-944-84X; 020-684-955-959-683; 021-413-738-345-994; 022-048-957-416-506; 022-122-264-466-570; 022-312-307-105-466; 024-105-415-124-278; 024-865-234-280-636; 025-178-686-299-831; 025-271-384-564-536; 027-040-518-302-553; 027-740-561-321-669; 028-087-588-577-186; 029-247-065-680-076; 030-128-462-353-953; 030-743-221-068-240; 031-588-429-350-076; 031-988-538-229-42X; 032-490-535-708-28X; 033-206-772-340-138; 033-389-281-394-208; 033-732-143-868-765; 034-589-729-411-452; 034-617-668-992-411; 039-173-559-532-501; 040-347-350-977-393; 040-581-425-033-879; 042-929-869-027-928; 043-066-522-858-373; 043-468-504-675-233; 043-621-948-687-591; 044-331-998-212-640; 052-805-198-494-338; 053-459-201-895-587; 055-118-088-434-582; 057-338-117-247-637; 060-037-246-361-427; 060-210-905-439-467; 060-828-803-209-403; 061-993-566-562-291; 062-999-057-705-534; 069-918-774-649-341; 070-088-749-578-68X; 073-774-791-038-387; 074-483-068-571-023; 074-824-824-291-661; 076-756-085-560-426; 077-053-872-824-350; 080-039-044-475-068; 081-551-713-791-527; 081-878-353-061-735; 083-275-795-865-394; 083-843-407-203-069; 084-605-209-482-880; 085-621-015-638-089; 087-465-273-400-533; 087-499-696-446-096; 088-278-678-940-450; 089-578-410-793-622; 091-082-371-346-290; 097-079-061-756-834; 100-035-572-016-477; 105-250-780-675-964; 106-307-185-085-207; 107-824-791-469-798; 110-912-375-911-346; 112-851-621-708-922; 120-254-147-605-508; 120-827-721-750-044; 122-192-863-911-620; 123-415-968-700-67X; 125-454-124-099-161; 126-107-719-155-679; 131-579-582-096-386; 140-012-047-331-814; 143-187-835-661-164; 151-201-219-956-274; 153-750-974-587-69X; 158-490-083-820-906; 171-505-386-709-359; 178-841-402-537-081,400

Hillary,"The global burden of mortality and morbidity caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) is significant, and the heterogeneity of TBI patients and the relatively small sample sizes of most current neuroimaging studies is a major challenge for scientific advances and clinical translation. The ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) Adult moderate/severe TBI (AMS-TBI) working group aims to be a driving force for new discoveries in AMS-TBI by providing researchers world-wide with an effective framework and platform for large-scale cross-border collaboration and data sharing. Based on the principles of transparency, rigor, reproducibility and collaboration, we will facilitate the development and dissemination of multiscale and big data analysis pipelines for harmonized analyses in AMS-TBI using structural and functional neuroimaging in combination with non-imaging biomarkers, genetics, as well as clinical and behavioral measures. Ultimately, we will offer investigators an unprecedented opportunity to test important hypotheses about recovery and morbidity in AMS-TBI by taking advantage of our robust methods for large-scale neuroimaging data analysis. In this consensus statement we outline the working group’s short-term, intermediate, and long-term goals.",15,2,526,554,Neuropsychology; Head injury; Open science; Rehabilitation; Neuroradiology; Traumatic brain injury;

Cell therapies, for example, rely not only on donated cells but also essentially on donated information to make them traceable. Despite the associated importance of concepts such as 'donor anonymity', the concept of anonymisation remains contentious. The Article 29 Working Party's 2014 guidance on 'Anonymisation Techniques' has perhaps helped encourage a perception that anonymity is the result of data modification 'techniques', rather than a broader process involving management of information and context. In light of this enduring ambiguity, this article advocates a 'relative' understanding of anonymity and supports this interpretation with reference not only to the General Data Protection Regulation but also to European Union health-related legislation, which also alludes to the concept. Anonymity, I suggest, should be understood not as a 'technique' which removes the need for information governance but rather as a legal standard of reasonable risk-management, which can only be satisfied by effective data protection. As such, anonymity can be not so much an alternative to data protection as its mirror, requiring similar safeguards to maintain privacy and confidentiality.",28,3,478,501,Internet privacy; Business; Anonymity; Information governance; Information sharing; Data sharing; European union; General Data Protection Regulation; Data Protection Act 1998; Big data,Anonymity; Cell donors; Confidentiality; Data sharing; Information sharing; Medical research,Biomedical Research; Clinical Trials as Topic/legislation & jurisprudence; Computer Security/legislation & jurisprudence; Confidentiality; Data Anonymization/legislation & jurisprudence; European Union; Guidelines as Topic/standards; Jurisprudence; Privacy; Tissue Donors/legislation & jurisprudence,,Medical Research Council (MC_PC_17215) United Kingdom,http://academic.oup.com/medlaw/article-abstract/28/3/478/5837617 https://academic.oup.com/medlaw/article-abstract/28/3/478/5837617?redirectedFrom=fulltext https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32413130/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32413130 https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:bf225dea-b918-4b83-9d98-e2c2401987d4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/medlaw/fwaa010,32413130,10.1093/medlaw/fwaa010,3026493823,,0,,1

D. Blower; Alastair Gemmell; Guy Griffiths; Keith Haines; Adityarajsingh Santokhee; X. Yang,"We describe ncWMS, an implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium's Web Map Service (WMS) specification for multidimensional gridded environmental data. ncWMS can read data in a large number of common scientific data formats - notably the NetCDF format with the Climate and Forecast conventions - then efficiently generate map imagery in thousands of different coordinate reference systems. It is designed to require minimal configuration from the system administrator and, when used in conjunction with a suitable client tool, provides end users with an interactive means for visualizing data without the need to download large files or interpret complex metadata. It is also used as a ""bridging"" tool providing interoperability between the environmental science community and users of geographic information systems. ncWMS implements a number of extensions to the WMS standard in order to fulfil some common scientific requirements, including the ability to generate plots representing timeseries and vertical sections. We discuss these extensions and their impact upon present and future interoperability. We discuss the conceptual mapping between the WMS data model and the data models used by gridded data formats, highlighting areas in which the mapping is incomplete or ambiguous. We discuss the architecture of the system and particular technical innovations of note, including the algorithms used for fast data reading and image generation. ncWMS has been widely adopted within the environmental data community and we discuss some of the ways in which the software is integrated within data infrastructures and portals.

Ferrand,"Summary Background The prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among youth is high in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the uptake of testing for and prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhoea) infections among youth in community-based settings in Zimbabwe, and explored the facilitators and barriers to testing. Methods This study was nested within a cluster randomised trial of community-based delivery of integrated HIV and sexual and reproductive health services for youth aged 16–24 years. Chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing via urine samples using the Xpert CT/NG test was offered in the four intervention clusters in Harare, Zimbabwe. Factors associated with testing uptake were investigated in a subset of participants (n=257) using hierarchical multivariate logistic regression. In-depth interviews with a separate purposively selected sample (n=26) explored facilitators and barriers to STI testing and partner notification and were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings Between June 1, 2019, and Jan 31, 2020, there were 6200 attendances by 4440 participants (78·2% women, 21·8% men) median age 20·3 (IQR 17·9–22·8) years. 1478 participants had 1501 tests done, and 248 tests were positive and 1253 tests were negative for chlamydia or gonorrhoea, or both. STI test uptake was 33·3% (95% CI 31·9–34·7), increasing from 11·7% in June, 2019, to 37·1% in January, 2020. The prevalence of chlamydia or gonorrhoea, or both, was 16·5% (95% CI 14·7–18·5; 248 of 1501), with only seven participants (3%) showing symptoms. The overall yield of testing was 4·0% (95% CI 3·5–4·5; 248 of 6200). Uptake was associated with having symptoms (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 14·8, 95% CI 1·66–132·07) and negatively associated with being single (adjusted OR 0·33, 95% CI 0·13–0·84) or having a boyfriend or girlfriend (adjusted OR 0·19, 95% CI 0·087–0·43) compared with being married, and being a student compared with being employed (adjusted OR 0·26, 95% CI 0·10–0·68). Perceived risk and symptoms of STIs were motivators for testing whereas misinformation, anticipated stigma, and concern about confidentiality were barriers. Interpretation The prevalence of chlamydia or gonorrhoea, or both, was high among youth but only a minority were symptomatic. Therefore most infections would remain untreated without access to STI testing. Provision of education, counselling, and confidentiality are essential to improve uptake and acceptability of STI testing.

Wechsler; James Zangrilli; David Price,"BACKGROUND: Severe asthma exerts a disproportionately heavy burden on patients and health care. Due to the heterogeneity of the severe asthma population, many patients need to be evaluated to understand the clinical features and outcomes of severe asthma in order to facilitate personalised and targeted care. The International Severe Asthma Registry (ISAR) is a multi-country registry project initiated to aid in this endeavour. METHODS: ISAR is a multi-disciplinary initiative benefitting from the combined experience of the ISAR Steering Committee (ISC; comprising 47 clinicians and researchers across 29 countries, who have a special interest and/or experience in severe asthma management or establishment and maintenance of severe asthma registries) in collaboration with scientists and experts in database management and communication. Patients (≥18 years old) receiving treatment according to the 2018 definitions of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Step 5 or uncontrolled on GINA Step 4 treatment will be included. Data will be collected on a core set of 95 variables identified using the Delphi method. Participating registries will agree to provide access to and share standardised anonymous patient-level data with ISAR. ISAR is a registered data source on the European Network of Centres for Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacovigilance. ISAR's collaborators include Optimum Patient Care, the Respiratory Effectiveness Group (REG) and AstraZeneca. ISAR is overseen by the ISC, REG, the Anonymised Data Ethics & Protocol Transparency Committee and the ISAR operational committee, ensuring the conduct of ethical, clinically relevant research that brings value to all key stakeholders. CONCLUSIONS: ISAR aims to offer a rich source of real-life data for scientific research to understand and improve disease burden, treatment patterns and patient outcomes in severe asthma. Furthermore, the registry will provide an international platform for research collaboration in respiratory medicine, with the overarching aim of improving primary and secondary care of adults with severe asthma globally.",20,1,212,,Health informatics; Health care; Pharmacoepidemiology; Disease registry; Disease burden; Population; Medical emergency; Pharmacovigilance; Delphi method; Medicine,Disease registry; Protocol; Real-world; Severe asthma,Adolescent; Adult; Asthma/diagnosis; Humans; Registries,,AstraZeneca; Optimum Patient Care,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8690305/file/8690331.pdf https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/international-severe-asthma-registry-isar-protocol-for-a-global-r https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02919353 https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/219206047/s12874_020_01065_0.pdf https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1464637-international-severe-asthma-registry-%28isar%29--protocol-for-a-global-registry http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/14996/1/Fitzgerald_et_al_BMC_InternationalSevereAsthma_VoR.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32819285/ https://repub.eur.nl/pub/129807/Repub_129807_O-A.pdf https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F6acea81c-83c0-4d7f-aeee-1ed01abbe4b3 https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/sv/publications/international-severe-asthma-registry-isar(f555fa9a-a53a-4c43-aac9-d5d62bf960be).html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439682 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32819285 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12874-020-01065-0 https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/14996 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/247602 https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/international-severe-asthma-registry-isar-protocol-for-a-global-r https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8690305 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/247602/PMC7439682.pdf https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/52383/items/1.0392889 https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/f555fa9a-a53a-4c43-aac9-d5d62bf960be https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12874-020-01065-0.pdf https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/international-severe-asthma-registry-isar-protocol-for-a-global-r https://repub.eur.nl/pub/129807 https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-020-01065-0 https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/international-severe-asthma-registry-isar-protocol-for-a-global-r,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01065-0,32819285,10.1186/s12874-020-01065-0,3039993240,PMC7439682,0,005-131-071-252-03X; 010-326-274-745-927; 010-778-543-706-158; 013-296-822-182-649; 019-706-757-416-919; 026-728-622-364-497; 026-735-405-344-022; 031-142-157-320-749; 032-744-272-199-088; 033-013-806-751-074; 046-319-979-215-396; 051-184-999-816-688; 053-932-308-941-898; 055-001-208-516-680; 059-786-215-023-911; 059-835-666-384-351; 060-714-772-856-994; 064-403-946-246-65X; 075-267-149-370-880; 081-491-651-689-348; 084-807-669-441-479; 085-175-891-303-185; 090-911-321-545-67X; 094-577-766-223-387; 096-909-546-514-669; 108-030-091-130-138; 117-362-547-961-536; 124-807-105-303-23X; 135-693-507-047-060; 140-927-846-070-695; 150-366-864-897-43X; 151-471-432-314-123; 183-646-254-271-978,7

O'Donnell; David Boddy; Fiona Smith; David Heaney; Frances S. Mair,"The major problem facing health and social care systems globally today is the growing challenge of an elderly population with complex health and social care needs. A longstanding challenge to the provision of high quality, effectively coordinated care for those with complex needs has been the historical separation of health and social care. Access to timely and accurate data about patients and their treatments has the potential to deliver better care at less cost. To explore the way in which structural, professional and geographical boundaries have affected e-health implementation in health and social care, through an empirical study of the implementation of an electronic version of Single Shared Assessment (SSA) in Scotland, using three retrospective, qualitative case studies in three different health board locations. Progress in effectively sharing electronic data had been slow and uneven. One cause was the presence of established structural boundaries, which lead to competing priorities, incompatible IT systems and infrastructure, and poor cooperation. A second cause was the presence of established professional boundaries, which affect staffs’ understanding and acceptance of data sharing and their information requirements. Geographical boundaries featured but less prominently and contrasting perspectives were found with regard to issues such as co-location of health and social care professionals. To provide holistic care to those with complex health and social care needs, it is essential that we develop integrated approaches to care delivery. Successful integration needs practices such as good project management and governance, ensuring system interoperability, leadership, good training and support, together with clear efforts to improve working relations across professional boundaries and communication of a clear project vision. This study shows that while technological developments make integration possible, long-standing boundaries constitute substantial risks to IT implementations across the health and social care interface which those initiating major changes would do well to consider before committing to the investment.",12,1,100,100,Unlicensed assistive personnel; Health informatics; HRHIS; Health care; Professional boundaries; Organizational Case Studies; Electronic data; Knowledge management; Organizational culture; Medicine,,"Aged, 80 and over; Attitude of Health Personnel; Diffusion of Innovation; Efficiency, Organizational; Electronic Health Records/instrumentation; Female; Health Plan Implementation/economics; Health Services Needs and Demand; Health Services for the Aged/economics; Holistic Health/economics; Humans; Interinstitutional Relations; Local Government; Male; National Health Programs; Organizational Case Studies; Organizational Culture; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; Qualitative Research; Retrospective Studies; Rural Health Services; Scotland; Systems Integration; Workforce",,Chief Scientist Office (CZG/3/23) United Kingdom,https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/boundaries-and-e-health-implementation-in-health-and-social-care https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-12-100 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1472-6947-12-100.pdf http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3830/1/Boundaries_and_ehealth.pdf https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-12-100 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3465217/ https://paperity.org/p/56997267/boundaries-and-e-health-implementation-in-health-and-social-care https://aura-test.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/3830 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1472-6947-12-100/fulltext.html http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/69367/ https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/boundaries-and-e-health-implementation-in-health-and-social-care http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3465217 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22958223/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1472-6947-12-100 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/midm/midm12.html#KingOBSHM12 https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/3830,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6947-12-100,22958223,10.1186/1472-6947-12-100,2080504666,PMC3465217,0,001-107-472-068-422; 002-882-688-490-597; 003-663-238-225-450; 004-648-654-538-801; 008-278-609-460-777; 008-281-779-637-640; 010-407-528-423-448; 011-540-300-653-609; 013-360-016-065-556; 021-594-396-383-346; 023-604-431-286-242; 023-993-042-523-891; 025-773-359-127-510; 032-178-484-803-829; 033-701-844-395-399; 036-189-391-158-049; 037-124-537-390-895; 040-366-698-834-186; 049-097-133-571-117; 056-999-656-921-83X; 057-471-110-155-10X; 061-999-022-489-847; 062-698-936-962-642; 063-720-464-515-450; 069-402-745-266-248; 075-643-699-172-869; 075-742-714-440-23X; 078-455-009-415-706; 080-961-186-035-919; 083-553-860-620-797; 088-733-617-281-326; 096-664-336-814-708; 096-955-903-191-077; 098-543-459-149-332; 102-738-091-295-093; 115-150-725-532-228; 132-636-970-396-983; 140-904-290-164-431; 142-218-218-623-35X; 173-174-852-359-974; 177-227-549-512-368; 190-166-209-784-871,31

A cohort study and survey in NHS England primary care,2018-12-22,2018,journal article,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,14602091; 03057453,Oxford University Press,United Kingdom,Richard Croker; Alex J Walker; Ben Goldacre,"Abstract Objectives To describe prescribing trends and geographic variation for trimethoprim and nitrofurantoin; to describe variation in implementing guideline change; and to compare actions taken to reduce trimethoprim use in high- and low-using Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). Design A retrospective cohort study and interrupted time series analysis in English NHS primary care prescribing data; complemented by information obtained through Freedom of Information Act requests to CCGs. The main outcome measures were: variation in practice and CCG prescribing ratios geographically and over time, including an interrupted time-series; and responses to Freedom of Information requests. Results The amount of trimethoprim prescribed, as a proportion of nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim combined, remained stable and high until 2014, then fell gradually to below 50% in 2017; this reduction was more rapid following the introduction of the Quality Premium. There was substantial variation in the speed of change between CCGs. As of April 2017, for the 10 worst CCGs (with the highest trimethoprim ratios): 9 still had trimethoprim as first line treatment for uncomplicated UTI (one CCG had no formulary); none had active work plans to facilitate change in prescribing behaviour away from trimethoprim; and none had implemented an incentive scheme for change in prescribing behaviour. For the 10 best CCGs: 2 still had trimethoprim as first line treatment (all CCGs had a formulary); 5 (out of 7 who answered this question) had active work plans to facilitate change in prescribing behaviour away from trimethoprim; and 5 (out of 10 responding) had implemented an incentive scheme for change in prescribing behaviour. 9 of the best 10 CCGs reported at least one of: formulary change, work plan, or incentive scheme. None of the worst 10 CCGs did so. Conclusions Many CCGs failed to implement an important change in antibiotic prescribing guidance; and report strong evidence suggesting that CCGs with minimal prescribing change did little to implement the new guidance. We strongly recommend a national programme of training and accreditation for medicines optimisation pharmacists; and remedial action for CCGs that fail to implement guidance; with all materials and data shared publicly for both such activities.",74,4,1125,1132,Formulary; Retrospective cohort study; Cohort study; Public health surveillance; Reimbursement; Guideline; Geographic difference; Incentive; Family medicine,,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Clinical Decision-Making; Drug Utilization/standards; England/epidemiology; Geography, Medical; Health Plan Implementation; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'/standards; Primary Health Care/standards; Public Health Surveillance; Reimbursement, Incentive; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urinary Tract Infections/drug therapy",Anti-Bacterial Agents,Department of Health United Kingdom,https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/publications/954982 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30590552/ https://figshare.com/collections/Why_did_some_practices_not_implement_new_antibiotic_prescribing_guidelines_on_urinary_tract_infection_A_cohort_study_and_survey_in_NHS_England_primary_care_/4197752/1 https://academic.oup.com/jac/article/74/4/1125/5258046 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30590552 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30590552,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jac/dky509,30590552,10.1093/jac/dky509,2810999566,,0,002-753-398-874-700; 012-774-607-905-389; 028-966-623-037-021; 032-572-474-831-055; 060-870-744-600-312,16

Kirkwood; Yasmeen Ahmad; Mark Larance; Angus I. Lamond,"Proteins form a diverse array of complexes that mediate cellular function and regulation. A largely unexplored feature of such protein complexes is the selective participation of specific protein isoforms and/or post-translationally modified forms. In this study, we combined native size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) with high-throughput proteomic analysis to characterize soluble protein complexes isolated from human osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells. Using this approach, we have identified over 71,500 peptides and 1,600 phosphosites, corresponding to over 8,000 proteins, distributed across 40 SEC fractions. This represents >50% of the predicted U2OS cell proteome, identified with a mean peptide sequence coverage of 27% per protein. Three biological replicates were performed, allowing statistical evaluation of the data and demonstrating a high degree of reproducibility in the SEC fractionation procedure. Specific proteins were detected interacting with multiple independent complexes, as typified by the separation of distinct complexes for the MRFAP1-MORF4L1-MRGBP interaction network. The data also revealed protein isoforms and post-translational modifications that selectively associated with distinct subsets of protein complexes. Surprisingly, there was clear enrichment for specific Gene Ontology terms associated with differential size classes of protein complexes. This study demonstrates that combined SEC/MS analysis can be used for the system-wide annotation of protein complexes and to predict potential isoform-specific interactions. All of these SEC data on the native separation of protein complexes have been integrated within the Encyclopedia of Proteome Dynamics, an online, multidimensional data-sharing resource available to the community.",12,12,3851,3873,Proteome; Protein isoform; Peptide sequence; Nuclear protein; Proteomics; Plasma protein binding; Gene isoform; Biochemistry; Quantitative proteomics; Biology; Cell biology,,"Carrier Proteins/genetics; Cell Line, Tumor; Chromatography, Gel; Databases, Protein; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Variation; Histone Acetyltransferases; Humans; Internet; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics; Mass Spectrometry; Nuclear Proteins/genetics; Osteoblasts/cytology; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Protein Isoforms/genetics; Protein Multimerization; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteome/genetics; Proteomics/methods; Reproducibility of Results; Solubility; Transcription Factors/genetics","Carrier Proteins; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; MORF4L1 protein, human; MRFAP1 protein, human; MRGBP protein, human; Nuclear Proteins; Protein Isoforms; Proteome; Transcription Factors; Histone Acetyltransferases",Wellcome Trust (083524/Z/07/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (097945) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (C20035) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (0909444/Z/09/Z) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/E010709/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (097945/B/11/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (073980/Z/03/Z) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/H007849/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/K003801/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0901002) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (073980) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (08136/Z/03/Z) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24043423 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620338469 https://www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/sites/www.lifesci.dundee.ac.uk/files/2013_Characterisation%20of%20Native%20Protein%20Complexes%20and%20Protein%20Isoform%20Variation%20using%20Size%20Fractionation%20Based.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3861729/ https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3861729 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24043423/ https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/characterization-of-native-protein-complexes-and-protein-isoform- https://www.mcponline.org/article/S1535-9476(20)33846-9/fulltext https://www.mcponline.org/lookup/doi/10.1074/mcp.M113.032367,http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/mcp.m113.032367,24043423,10.1074/mcp.m113.032367,2139081437,PMC3861729,0,000-702-097-343-719; 003-596-101-918-232; 004-678-963-178-210; 006-633-346-400-676; 006-838-904-993-55X; 006-980-523-575-087; 007-585-958-259-151; 008-093-412-578-99X; 010-092-372-272-431; 011-146-482-116-314; 013-675-723-838-235; 014-190-751-467-356; 015-335-303-294-608; 018-509-201-715-017; 019-348-487-343-002; 023-728-660-753-435; 024-846-332-754-563; 025-372-862-229-971; 028-308-407-324-005; 031-987-314-603-297; 032-791-387-878-840; 033-777-810-365-037; 034-573-243-966-355; 036-283-707-895-91X; 037-549-719-768-426; 037-880-782-125-95X; 039-476-472-494-82X; 040-134-400-039-903; 041-784-490-056-272; 043-033-937-395-605; 047-547-724-054-149; 048-106-120-739-115; 049-254-245-392-777; 052-026-357-553-073; 056-423-028-656-80X; 057-350-495-594-603; 057-560-029-105-054; 058-390-992-893-367; 059-433-663-146-25X; 062-069-087-677-262; 069-333-560-323-633; 069-514-159-886-686; 073-669-920-729-682; 074-019-924-760-099; 076-672-308-773-19X; 076-760-839-859-275; 077-618-651-957-729; 078-929-774-459-695; 080-129-698-565-416; 080-406-766-764-103; 081-033-321-935-819; 082-602-155-503-431; 089-481-084-303-673; 096-304-376-674-755; 097-259-033-863-956; 097-470-814-949-756; 100-331-291-299-374; 100-455-041-464-423; 103-289-911-965-562; 103-403-234-943-863; 107-007-514-420-865; 109-821-032-274-307; 122-481-080-454-356; 126-000-485-072-431; 127-797-283-366-228; 127-858-345-988-388; 145-251-601-515-419; 172-468-479-027-302; 178-295-339-798-426,113

Field,"Abstract Objectives This Liverpool Healthy Lung Programme is a response to high rates of lung cancer and respiratory diseases locally and aims to diagnose lung cancer at an earlier stage by proactive approach to those at high risk of lung cancer. The objective of this study is to evaluate the programme in terms of its likely effect on mortality from lung cancer and its delivery to deprived populations. Methods Persons aged 58–75 years, with a history of smoking or a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 2 according to general practice records were invited for lung health check in a community health hub setting. A detailed risk assessment and spirometry were performed in eligible patients. Those with a 5% or greater five-year risk of lung cancer were referred for a low dose CT 3 scan. Results A total of 4 566 subjects attended the appointment for risk assessment and 3 591 (79%) consented to data sharing. More than 80% of the patients were in the most deprived quintile of the index of multiple deprivation. Of those attending, 63% underwent spirometry and 43% were recommended for a CT scan. A total of 25 cancers were diagnosed, of which 16 (64%) were stage I. Comparison with the national stage distribution implied that the programme was reducing lung cancer mortality by 22%. Conclusions Community based proactive approaches to early diagnosis of lung cancer in health deprived regions are likely to be effective in early detection of lung cancer.",134,,66,71,Risk assessment; Internal medicine; Stage (cooking); Community health; Lung cancer; COPD; Lung; Spirometry; Low dose ct; Medicine,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Early diagnosis; Health inequalities; Low-dose CT; Lung cancer; Smoking,"Aged; Community Health Services/methods; Early Detection of Cancer/methods; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/diagnosis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Smoking; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; United Kingdom/epidemiology",,Department of Health (09/61/01) United Kingdom,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169500219304702 https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/58971 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319997 https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3046386/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31319997/ https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/147617/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31319997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lungcan.2019.05.026,31319997,10.1016/j.lungcan.2019.05.026,2947298002,,0,004-814-913-663-289; 006-354-719-754-695; 007-549-172-594-144; 007-822-450-756-292; 007-977-539-650-466; 008-767-063-689-883; 009-928-101-807-045; 012-716-977-216-067; 018-912-423-770-580; 023-324-406-616-266; 027-025-887-724-174; 027-489-495-425-533; 027-543-758-832-769; 036-356-779-276-565; 037-677-610-916-153; 037-870-527-459-013; 041-402-595-261-794; 043-295-319-120-583; 043-665-559-869-142; 045-318-262-593-292; 049-822-188-813-004; 054-717-529-826-556; 054-882-946-480-970; 066-344-402-378-326; 069-249-447-413-790; 078-625-774-177-863; 081-146-092-338-746; 088-353-820-542-291; 091-876-946-561-499; 094-966-448-050-010; 104-899-796-688-110; 112-261-542-588-301; 118-186-703-284-562; 136-401-575-509-828; 148-684-403-540-747,18

We draw on an understanding of ADM as a socio-technical process involving both human and technical elements, beginning before a decision is made and extending beyond the decision itself. While explanations and other model-centric mechanisms may assist some accountability concerns, they often provide insufficient information of these broader ADM processes for regulatory oversight and assessments of legal compliance. Reviewability involves breaking down the ADM process into technical and organisational elements to provide a systematic framework for determining the contextually appropriate record-keeping mechanisms to facilitate meaningful review - both of individual decisions and of the process as a whole. We argue that a reviewability framework, drawing on administrative law's approach to reviewing human decision-making, offers a practical way forward towards more a more holistic and legally-relevant form of accountability for ADM.",,,598,609,Process management; Audit; Accountability; Legal compliance; Computer science; Process (engineering); Administrative law,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04201 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2102.html#abs-2102-04201 https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442188.3445921,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445921,,10.1145/3442188.3445921,3134395196,,0,001-446-075-799-615; 002-121-625-226-370; 002-189-600-394-643; 003-356-046-180-825; 007-146-758-700-593; 014-396-892-197-971; 018-822-581-363-834; 023-063-388-078-229; 023-513-788-923-01X; 029-567-500-724-540; 042-697-724-238-492; 044-408-770-208-63X; 045-451-413-719-79X; 045-469-751-890-392; 050-016-604-873-284; 058-251-655-439-091; 059-274-241-274-299; 065-009-898-830-94X; 068-102-610-268-843; 068-580-706-333-220; 071-860-959-402-137; 077-902-632-083-884; 078-786-134-300-330; 088-476-793-432-66X; 091-886-126-584-918; 096-551-054-053-196; 102-858-046-388-326; 107-939-611-294-784; 116-057-853-146-778; 125-382-352-988-796; 131-730-725-189-002; 137-995-102-600-08X; 140-239-995-014-989; 149-191-469-363-852; 150-120-864-451-69X; 158-552-356-085-275; 167-875-097-225-36X; 190-516-214-852-864; 190-939-725-929-776,9

Maguire; Prabin Dahal; Sumayyah Rashan; Roland Ngu; Anca Boon; Colin Forsyth; Nathalie Strub-Wourgaft; Eric Chatelain; Fabiana Barreira; Sergio Sosa-Estani; Philippe J Guerin,"Background Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects ~6-7 million people worldwide. Significant limitations still exist in our understanding of CD. Harnessing individual participant data (IPD) from studies could support more in-depth analyses to address the many outstanding research questions. This systematic review aims to describe the characteristics and treatment practices of clinical studies in CD and assess the breadth and availability of research data for the potential establishment of a data-sharing platform. Methodology/principal findings This review includes prospective CD clinical studies published after 1997 with patients receiving a trypanocidal treatment. The following electronic databases and clinical trial registry platforms were searched: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Scielo, Clintrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. Of the 11,966 unique citations screened, 109 (0.9%) studies (31 observational and 78 interventional) representing 23,116 patients were included. Diagnosis for patient enrolment required 1 positive test result in 5 (4.6%) studies (2 used molecular method, 1 used molecular and serology, 2 used serology and parasitological methods), 2 in 60 (55.0%), 3 in 14 (12.8%) and 4 or more in 4 (3.7%) studies. A description of treatment regimen was available for 19,199 (83.1%) patients, of whom 14,605 (76.1%) received an active treatment and 4,594 (23.9%) were assigned to a placebo/no-treatment. Of the 14,605 patients who received an active treatment, benznidazole was administered in 12,467 (85.4%), nifurtimox in 825 (5.6%), itraconazole in 284 (1.9%), allopurinol in 251 (1.7%) and other drugs in 286 (1.9%). Assessment of efficacy varied largely and was based primarily on biological outcome; parasitological efficacy relied on serology in 67/85 (78.8%) studies, molecular methods in 52/85 (61.2%), parasitological in 34/85 (40.0%), microscopy in 3/85 (3.5%) and immunohistochemistry in 1/85 (1.2%). The median time at which parasitological assessment was carried out was 79 days [interquartile range (IQR): 30-180] for the first assessment, 180 days [IQR: 60-500] for second, and 270 days [IQR: 18-545] for the third assessment. Conclusions/significance This review demonstrates the heterogeneity of clinical practice in CD treatment and in the conduct of clinical studies. The sheer volume of potential IPD identified demonstrates the potential for development of an IPD platform for CD and that such efforts would enable in-depth analyses to optimise the limited pharmacopoeia of CD and inform prospective data collection.",15,8,e0009697,,Interquartile range; Internal medicine; Systematic review; Observational study; Placebo; Benznidazole; Cochrane Library; MEDLINE; Clinical trial; Medicine,,"Adolescent; Antiparasitic Agents; Chagas Disease/drug therapy; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Trials as Topic; Female; Humans; Male; Observational Studies as Topic; Treatment Outcome; Trypanocidal Agents/administration & dosage; Trypanosoma cruzi/drug effects; Young Adult",Antiparasitic Agents; Trypanocidal Agents,"uk aid; federal ministry of education and research (bmbf) through kfw; dutch ministry of foreign affairs (dgis), the netherlands; Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), Switzerland; Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders) International",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34398888 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/1192153 https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0009697&type=printable https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8428795 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1192153 https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0009697 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009697 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34398888/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009697,34398888,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009697,3196073145,PMC8428795,0,000-383-283-053-883; 001-801-515-038-945; 005-268-944-005-300; 008-724-815-413-151; 009-751-887-782-941; 012-184-532-439-298; 012-649-367-127-633; 012-912-130-922-626; 015-263-011-118-741; 015-858-891-845-535; 015-985-400-691-079; 017-845-423-637-68X; 020-522-890-823-256; 025-022-054-560-172; 027-282-512-961-98X; 027-475-368-439-812; 027-639-903-589-045; 031-895-239-113-803; 036-312-661-618-588; 036-619-602-757-226; 036-895-778-525-614; 038-157-414-709-63X; 042-319-906-827-388; 043-508-595-840-25X; 046-625-016-966-336; 050-815-559-797-075; 055-503-517-680-230; 057-960-775-771-289; 060-544-750-145-121; 063-878-255-210-060; 067-221-569-108-471; 068-059-523-473-653; 073-441-671-775-547; 076-593-122-243-224; 077-472-501-938-240; 081-374-102-479-361; 085-318-500-089-798; 087-004-831-110-29X; 087-430-647-908-72X; 092-661-181-632-723; 096-742-036-084-660; 110-567-781-447-900; 112-536-150-062-933; 117-847-857-173-119; 130-616-424-529-063; 155-466-406-081-96X; 160-639-522-996-415,1

Van Citters; Kathryn A. Sabadosa; Eugene C. Nelson,"New opportunities to record, collate, and analyze routine patient data have prompted optimism about the potential of learning health systems. However, real-life examples of such systems remain rare and few have been exposed to study. We aimed to examine the views of design stakeholders on designing and implementing a US-based registry-enabled care and learning system for cystic fibrosis (RCLS-CF). We conducted a two-phase qualitative study with stakeholders involved in designing, implementing, and using the RCLS-CF. First, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 program personnels involved in design and delivery of the program. We then undertook 11 follow-up interviews. Analysis of interviews was based on the constant comparative method, supported by NVivo software. The organizing principle for the RCLS-CF was a shift to more partnership-based relationships between patients and clinicians, founded in values of co-production, and facilitated by technology-enabled data sharing. Participants proposed that, for the system to be successful, the data it collects must be both clinically useful and meaningful to patients and clinicians. They suggested that the prerequisites included a technological infrastructure capable of supporting data entry and joint decision-making in an accessible way, and a set of social conditions, including willingness from patients and clinicians alike to work together in new ways that build on the expertise of both parties. Follow-up interviews highlighted some of the obstacles, including technical challenges and practical constraints on refiguring relationships between clinicians and patients. The values and vision underlying the RCLS-CF were shared and clearly and consistently articulated by design stakeholders. The challenges to realization were often not at the level of principle, but were both practical and social in character. Lessons from this study may be useful to other systems looking to harness the power of “big data” registries, including patient-reported data, for care, research, and quality improvement.",15,1,16,16,Health informatics; Grounded theory; Qualitative research; Organizing principle; Data sharing; Health services research; Program evaluation; Knowledge management; Medicine; Big data,Co-production; Cystic fibrosis; Learning health systems; Program theory; Qualitative; Quality improvement; Registries; Replication,"Cystic Fibrosis/therapy; Decision Making, Shared; Humans; Information Technology; Interviews as Topic; Learning Health System/organization & administration; Patient Participation/methods; Qualitative Research; Quality Improvement/organization & administration; Social Environment; Stakeholder Participation; United States",,Wellcome Trust (WT097899) United Kingdom; Department of Health (NF-SI-0617-10026) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13012-020-0976-1 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32143678/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13012-020-0976-1.pdf https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13012-020-0976-1 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/302835 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7060536 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7060536,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13012-020-0976-1,32143678,10.1186/s13012-020-0976-1,3012462615,PMC7060536,0,001-382-364-030-650; 002-835-689-107-236; 005-434-587-240-994; 006-490-488-855-339; 008-651-704-515-732; 009-641-220-979-204; 015-476-387-515-138; 015-913-912-085-141; 018-940-790-610-325; 019-042-549-897-616; 019-693-303-449-724; 020-849-546-185-763; 022-824-814-475-268; 023-718-111-956-265; 023-844-055-716-335; 029-840-270-831-774; 037-102-979-151-536; 042-806-836-965-483; 044-961-012-998-162; 050-511-065-722-302; 051-761-229-928-031; 053-062-438-124-013; 054-292-311-809-250; 079-926-911-036-086; 089-796-326-645-673; 093-813-767-023-008; 098-838-882-415-595; 104-295-542-059-456; 112-021-626-605-970; 117-422-760-560-709; 126-856-459-822-495; 127-506-901-939-247; 128-191-046-842-913; 140-963-096-623-446; 173-121-059-528-18X; 193-539-812-454-488,8

Although guidelines increasingly recommend integrated screening for multiple infections to reduce morbidity little is known about what migrants and healthcare professionals think about this approach. Methods Prospective qualitative study in Leicester, United Kingdom within a novel city-wide integrated screening programme in three iterative phases to understand views about infections and integrated screening. Phase 1 focus groups (nine) with migrants from diverse communities (n = 74); phase 2 semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals involved in the screening pathway (n = 32); phase 3 semi-structured interviews (n = 23) with individuals having tested positive for one/more infections through the programme. Analysis was informed by the constant comparative process and iterative across phases 1–3. Findings Migrants’ awareness of TB, HIV and hepatitis B/C varied, with greater awareness of TB and HIV than hepatitis B/C; perceived susceptibility to the infections was low. The integrated screening programme was well-received by migrants and professionals; concerns were limited to data-sharing. As anticipated, given the target group, language was cited as a challenge but mitigated by various interpretation strategies. Interpretation This large qualitative analysis is the first to confirm that integrated screening for key infectious diseases is feasible, positively viewed by, and acceptable to, migrants and healthcare professionals. These findings support recent guideline recommendations and therefore have important implications for policy-makers and clinicians as programmes of this type are more widely implemented in diverse settings.

Here we define a common methodological framework for MEG resting-state acquisition and analysis to facilitate the pooling of data from different sites. Methods Two groups of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 84) and healthy controls (n = 84) were combined from three sites, and site and group differences inspected in terms of power spectra and functional connectivity. Classification accuracy for MCI versus controls was compared across three different types of MEG analyses, and compared with classification based on structural MRI. Results The spectral analyses confirmed frequency-specific differences in patients with MCI, both in power and connectivity patterns, with highest classification accuracy from connectivity.

These algorithms find myriads of applications, but their ubiquity often comes at the expense of limited interpretability, hidden biases and unexpected vulnerabilities. Whenever one of these factors is a priority, the learning algorithm of choice is often a method considered to be inherently interpretable, e.g. logical models such as decision trees. In my research I challenge this assumption and highlight (quite common) cases when the assumed interpretability fails to deliver. To restore interpretability of logical machine learning models (decision trees and their ensembles in particular) I propose to explain them with class-contrastive counterfactual statements, which are a very common type of explanation in human interactions, well-grounded in social science research. To evaluate transparency of such models I collate explainability desiderata that can be used to systematically assess and compare such methods as an addition to user studies. Given contrastive explanations, I investigate their influence on the model's security, in particular gaming and stealing the model. Finally, I evaluate model fairness, where I am interested in choosing the most fair model among all the models with equal performance.",,,541,542,Counterfactual thinking; Artificial intelligence; Accountability; Transparency (behavior); Interpretability; Computer science; Decision tree,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3306618.3314316 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/aies/aies2019.html#Sokol19 https://doi.org/10.1145/3306618.3314316 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3306618.3314316,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3306618.3314316,,10.1145/3306618.3314316,2959176945,,0,020-058-272-123-387; 020-087-995-276-005; 024-991-312-366-441; 062-287-641-526-53X; 073-128-497-141-918; 078-141-527-597-27X; 078-589-062-945-240; 087-323-490-534-091; 198-796-262-713-316,2

Belzunce; Julia Schubert; Graham E. Searle; Alex Whittington; Ayla Mansur; Joel Dunn; Andrew J. Reader; Roger N. Gunn,"The reproducibility of findings is a compelling methodological problem that the neuroimaging community is facing these days. The lack of standardized pipelines for image processing, quantification and statistics plays a major role in the variability and interpretation of results, even when the same data are analysed. This problem is well-known in MRI studies, where the indisputable value of the method has been complicated by a number of studies that produce discrepant results. However, any research domain with complex data and flexible analytical procedures can experience a similar lack of reproducibility. In this paper we investigate this issue for brain PET imaging. During the 2018 NeuroReceptor Mapping conference, the brain PET community was challenged with a computational contest involving a simulated neurotransmitter release experiment. Fourteen international teams analysed the same imaging dataset, for which the ground-truth was known. Despite a plurality of methods, the solutions were consistent across participants, although not identical. These results should create awareness that the increased sharing of PET data alone will only be one component of enhancing confidence in neuroimaging results and that it will be important to complement this with full details of the analysis pipelines and procedures that have been used to quantify data.",41,10,2778,2796,Data science; Data sharing; Pet imaging; Mri studies; Computer science; Neuroimaging; Image processing; Reproducibility,PET; data analysis; data sharing; reproducibility crisis; “NRM2018 PET Grand Challenge”,"Congresses as Topic; Female; History, 21st Century; Humans; Male; Neuroimaging/methods; Positron-Emission Tomography/methods; Reproducibility of Results",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Department of Health United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (148/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X211015101 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0271678X211015101 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33993794/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993794,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0271678x211015101,33993794,10.1177/0271678x211015101,3162111148,PMC8504414,0,001-111-834-008-18X; 001-850-585-660-319; 001-899-811-262-763; 006-566-846-138-136; 008-046-005-014-634; 011-071-952-194-162; 016-772-361-990-814; 020-545-229-948-795; 020-848-176-029-24X; 023-442-434-747-228; 023-563-505-602-634; 024-579-547-458-960; 024-985-541-564-221; 026-480-599-550-630; 027-660-861-642-595; 027-984-284-102-740; 028-759-155-895-436; 029-388-668-501-718; 029-910-535-416-172; 034-036-460-406-182; 034-929-907-512-167; 044-704-539-342-357; 047-771-088-323-446; 048-039-092-200-798; 049-316-177-538-340; 051-368-600-134-228; 055-321-424-160-861; 064-950-221-996-739; 071-217-113-740-770; 074-538-511-734-268; 077-485-157-126-405; 080-915-861-052-011; 082-317-724-337-486; 091-782-032-194-592; 093-359-386-037-169; 094-404-005-408-154; 096-603-197-996-687; 098-340-439-629-179; 107-771-298-056-846; 116-337-392-361-606; 123-958-152-397-939; 137-171-171-948-416; 164-548-277-148-966; 173-089-831-107-94X,2

Kabudula; Francesc Xavier Gómez-Olivé; Georges Reniers,"Background: It is common practice for HIV programmes to routinely trace patients who are late for a scheduled clinic visit to ensure continued care engagement. In South Africa, patients who are late for a scheduled visit are identified from clinic registers, and called by telephone up to three times by designated clinic staff, with home visits conducted for those who are unreachable by phone. It is important to understand outcomes among late patients in order to have accurate mortality data, identify defaulters to attempt to re-engage them into care, and have accurate estimates of patients still in care for planning purposes.Objective: We conducted a study to assess whether tracing of HIV patients in clinics in rural north-eastern South Africa was implemented in line with national policies.Methods: Thirty-three person-day of observations took place during multiple visits to eight facilities between October 2017 and January 2018 during which clinic tracing processes were captured. The facility level implementation processes were compared to the intended tracing process and gaps and challenges were identified.Results: Challenges to implementing effective tracing procedures fell into three broad categories: i) facility-level barriers, ii) issues relating to data, documentation and record-keeping, and iii) challenges relating to the roles and responsibilities of the different actors in the tracing cascade.We recommend improving linkages between clinics, improving record-keeping systems, and regular training of community health workers involved in tracing activities. Improved links between clinics would reduce the chance of patients being lost between clinics. Record-keeping systems could be improved through motivating health workers to take ownership of their data and training them on the importance of complete data. Finally, training of community health workers may improve sustained motivation, and improve their ability to respond appropriately to their clients' needs.Conclusions: Substantial investment in data infrastructure and healthcare staff training is needed to improve routine tracing.",13,1,1755115,,Tracing; Health care; Phone; Antiretroviral therapy; Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Hiv patients; Mortality data; Family medicine; Documentation; Medicine,HIV; Loss to follow-up; engagement; retention; tracing,Ambulatory Care Facilities/organization & administration; Anti-Retroviral Agents/therapeutic use; Appointments and Schedules; Community Health Workers; HIV Infections/drug therapy; Health Policy; Humans; Lost to Follow-Up; Retention in Care; Rural Population; South Africa/epidemiology,Anti-Retroviral Agents,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7241554 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32340584/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/16549716.2020.1755115 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16549716.2020.1755115 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32340584,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16549716.2020.1755115,32340584,10.1080/16549716.2020.1755115,3018991049,PMC7241554,0,005-309-469-021-499; 010-660-583-612-742; 012-880-133-176-311; 013-510-627-425-582; 017-637-909-560-903; 018-142-424-606-805; 018-638-453-898-674; 020-228-827-163-112; 020-559-067-465-797; 020-952-675-290-469; 021-057-653-546-035; 023-067-793-083-644; 026-809-591-800-042; 036-612-516-650-519; 038-594-781-239-065; 039-141-406-303-031; 041-015-227-679-37X; 042-098-557-295-363; 042-641-550-467-996; 042-805-830-723-462; 047-124-135-764-316; 047-532-205-473-403; 048-041-369-657-647; 051-744-968-931-846; 052-513-628-994-371; 055-691-024-569-551; 056-224-868-622-475; 057-008-626-319-107; 057-979-493-964-381; 058-204-475-220-787; 085-918-983-982-298; 097-830-378-505-601; 098-478-862-771-588; 101-381-780-003-388; 111-905-173-503-484; 114-194-777-111-896; 115-611-682-385-457; 118-231-957-552-563; 123-191-832-555-127; 128-622-686-272-914; 128-798-162-702-484; 145-353-723-923-282; 168-257-356-933-191; 173-191-119-587-880; 188-841-508-238-808,2

Public involvement is essential to building locally responsive research policies, including on data sharing, but little research has involved stakeholders from low-to-middle income countries. Methods Between January and June 2014, a qualitative study was conducted in Kenya involving sixty stakeholders with varying experiences of research in a deliberative process to explore views on benefits and challenges in research data sharing. In-depth interviews and extended small group discussions based on information sharing and facilitated debate were used to collect data. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis, and charting flow and dynamics in debates. Findings The findings highlight both the opportunities and challenges of communicating about this complex and relatively novel topic for many stakeholders. For more and less research-experienced stakeholders, ethical research data sharing is likely to rest on the development and implementation of appropriate trust-building processes, linked to local perceptions of benefits and challenges. The central nature of trust is underpinned by uncertainties around who might request what data, for what purpose and when. Key benefits perceived in this consultation were concerned with the promotion of public health through science, with legitimate beneficiaries defined differently by different groups. Important challenges were risks to the interests of study participants, communities and originating researchers through stigmatisation, loss of privacy, impacting autonomy and unfair competition, including through forms of intentional and unintentional 'misuse' of data. Risks were also seen for science. Discussion Given background structural inequities in much international research, building trust in this low-to-middle income setting includes ensuring that the interests of study participants, primary communities and originating researchers will be promoted as far as possible, as well as protected. Important ways of building trust in data sharing include involving the public in policy development and implementation, promoting scientific collaborations around data sharing and building close partnerships between researchers and government health authorities to provide checks and balances on data sharing, and promote near and long-term translational benefits.",10,9,e0135545,,Environmental resource management; Public policy; Business; Research ethics; Qualitative research; Information sharing; Data sharing; Science policy; Health services research; Public relations; Social research,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomedical Research/ethics; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; International Cooperation; Kenya; Middle Aged; Public Health/ethics; Research Personnel/ethics; Social Stigma; Trust",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (096527) United Kingdom,https://paperity.org/p/74084282/research-stakeholders-views-on-benefits-and-challenges-for-public-health-research-data https://core.ac.uk/display/150177866 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/543232 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4557837 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26331716 https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/543232 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/543232 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/543232 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135545 https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/543232 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135545 https://doaj.org/article/b5cc8a8d1c6842cb85c86355fce17772 https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4557837/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26331716/ http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PLoSO..1035545J/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135545,26331716,10.1371/journal.pone.0135545,1885409381,PMC4557837,0,000-596-366-937-173; 001-624-916-522-59X; 004-352-766-892-319; 006-163-147-328-401; 007-368-971-398-77X; 019-538-368-158-59X; 020-013-516-594-400; 021-672-229-560-342; 023-097-073-292-349; 026-354-553-648-432; 027-614-876-022-826; 031-963-146-907-550; 032-520-030-950-067; 033-706-344-295-941; 035-813-132-606-003; 037-126-838-015-529; 038-824-642-263-293; 042-355-275-020-040; 043-461-666-754-223; 044-230-020-749-669; 046-849-371-099-946; 048-610-154-684-207; 058-448-259-703-646; 060-183-433-104-114; 065-059-347-961-228; 067-481-268-141-412; 070-964-123-925-720; 074-614-949-934-346; 084-836-864-861-404; 100-441-363-187-695; 101-661-712-722-82X; 110-837-660-980-431; 118-085-022-435-430; 123-224-961-607-542; 124-707-160-725-322; 130-389-785-483-120; 135-302-870-468-483; 136-141-831-247-081; 136-603-696-153-587; 153-907-485-892-960; 164-578-363-379-987; 166-968-590-450-006,26

We give an overview of the current consortium activities and describe the advances of the past few years. Augmenting the PX founding members (PRIDE and PeptideAtlas, including the PASSEL resource), two new members have joined the consortium: MassIVE and jPOST. ProteomeCentral remains as the common data access portal, providing the ability to search for data sets in all participating PX resources, now with enhanced data visualization components.We describe the updated submission guidelines, now expanded to include four members instead of two. As demonstrated by data submission statistics, PX is supporting a change in culture of the proteomics field: public data sharing is now an accepted standard, supported by requirements for journal submissions resulting in public data release becoming the norm. More than 4500 data sets have been submitted to the various PX resources since 2012. Human is the most represented species with approximately half of the data sets, followed by some of the main model organisms and a growing list of more than 900 diverse species. Data reprocessing activities are becoming more prominent, with both MassIVE and PeptideAtlas releasing the results of reprocessed data sets.

2983,044-297-376-315-69X,Updating and refining estimates of typhoid fever burden for public health action.,,2014,journal article,The Lancet. Global health,2214109x,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,John A. Crump,"Efforts to estimate the global burden of typhoid fever can be traced to a meeting of the Pan American Health Organization in 1984 and publication of the outcome in 1986.1 Although an important first step, the 1984 study was recognised as having a number of limitations including provision of scanty methodological detail, the availability of few source data, exclusion of China from the estimate, and lack of consideration of the age distribution of typhoid fever. Subsequently the global typhoid burden was re-estimated for the year 2000, accounting for growth of the global population, new typhoid fever incidence data from population-based studies and the control groups of vaccine trials, advances in the understanding of the age distribution of typhoid fever and its relation to force of infection, adjustment for blood culture sensitivity, and formalisation of methods for assessment of disease burden.2 Since 2000, an updated review of population-based studies of typhoid fever incidence and data from notifiable disease reports from countries with advanced surveillance systems has been published.3 Incorporating these data, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) added their first estimate of disability and death associated with typhoid and paratyphoid fevers in aggregate to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 project.4,5 The IHME GBD 2010 estimate could be criticised for insufficient methodological detail for external reproducibility, lack of disaggregation of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, little description of the age distribution of disease, and the surprising selection of liver abscesses and cysts as the prime disease complication of interest.6; ; It is in this context that Vittal Mogasale and others revisit typhoid fever burden with an eye to refining estimates to inform vaccine policy.7 Theirs is not a global estimate, although most typhoid fever cases do occur in countries classified in the low-income and middle-income group. Furthermore, with monovalent typhoid vaccines in mind, the focus is exclusively on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, with no estimate for Salmonella Paratyphi A or for invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella. The investigators did a series of well described systematic reviews to update and improve estimates of typhoid fever incidence, including age distribution, blood-culture sensitivity, and case-fatality ratio. They also take the innovative step of adding a risk-factor-based adjustment of typhoid fever incidence that accounts for lack of access to improved water in rural areas and in urban slums. This adjustment was derived from a further systematic review of case-control studies to ascertain the contribution of waterborne transmission to typhoid fever risk. In so doing, Mogasale and colleagues estimate that 11·9 million typhoid fever illnesses and 129 000 deaths occurred in low-income and middle-income countries 2010. These numbers are lower overall by almost half compared with earlier estimates,2 and suggest higher incidence in Africa and lower incidence in Asia than previously thought. Whether these differences reflect true changes in typhoid fever epidemiology over time, methodological differences, or both is difficult to know.; ; Mogasale and colleagues highlight a number of limitations. First, despite the growing number of studies on typhoid fever incidence, the amount of source data remains quite scarce. Furthermore, what constitutes a population-based study of typhoid fever incidence is open to inter pretation. Mogasale and others chose a fairly permissive interpretation to optimise the breadth of data. One consequence is the inclusion of a heterogeneous group of study types that are likely to vary considerably in the completeness of capture of cases. This can be problematic when seeking to understand typhoid fever incidence by age group, when differences in detection by age could have substantial effects on apparent age distribution. Indeed, the age distribution of cases derived from Mogasale and colleagues’ review differs from that measured by very intensive active surveillance in a high incidence setting.8; ; Second, although it is an important and biologically plausible refinement, risk-factor adjustment based on lack of access to improved water in rural areas and urban slums could be open to criticism, as the authors acknowledge. The imperfect relation between access to improved water and consumption of microbiologically safe water is underscored by the occurrence of massive typhoid fever outbreaks in settings with water sources that would be classified as improved.9; ; Third, reliable estimates of typhoid fever complications and death remain elusive. Hospital-based studies can be biased towards severe disease, yet the early detection and treatment of cases inherent and appropriate in high-quality populated-based disease surveillance systems undoubtedly modifies patients’ outcomes.10,11 Finally, it is important to ask how the results stack up against other sources of data. Few would question that typhoid fever has declined in a number of Asian countries.12 Furthermore, there have been increasing reports of high levels of endemic13,14 and epidemic15,16 typhoid fever from some locations in Africa. However, studies of community-acquired bloodstream infections suggest that non-typhoidal Salmonella has been more common than typhoidal Salmonella in sub-Saharan Africa17 and national disease surveillance data do not seem consistent with the suggestion that South Africa is a country with a high incidence of typhoid fever.18 Indeed, as highlighted by Mogasale and colleagues, incidence estimates for sub-Saharan Africa are heavily influenced by one population-based study from an urban slum in Nairobi, Kenya.13 The recently completed multicountry study of typhoid fever incidence in Africa should go some way to providing more data and addressing these concerns.19; ; Burden of disease estimates are foundational to building the investment case for both vaccine and non-vaccine interventions for typhoid fever. Decisions about who would most benefit from vaccination and at what age rely on a clear epidemiological picture. Our picture of typhoid fever burden remains clouded, but Mogasale and colleagues have made refinements that challenge us to think more deeply and to value new data. Soon two new estimates of global typhoid and paratyphoid fever burden, from IHME GBD 201320 and the WHO Foodborne Diseases Burden Epidemiology Reference Group,21 will become available. The iterative process of refining and updating burden estimates for typhoid fever is now occurring both consecutively and in parallel, with multiple groups working somewhat independently. Looking to the future, it might be time to take stock of existing estimates and methods, drawing from the strengths of each approach, and striving for both methods that are transparent and results that are timely. Typhoid control would benefit from collective effort to ensure the best possible data to support policy decisions and from a clear message to the world on the scale of the problem.",2,10,e551,3,Epidemiology; Public health; Disease surveillance; Notifiable disease; Paratyphoid fever; Population; Veterinary medicine; Force of infection; Typhoid fever; Medicine; Environmental health,,Global Health; Humans; Population Surveillance; Public Health; Risk Factors; Typhoid Fever/epidemiology; Typhoid-Paratyphoid Vaccines/administration & dosage,Typhoid-Paratyphoid Vaccines,FIC NIH HHS (R01 TW009237) United States; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/L018926) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/L018845) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/L017679) United Kingdom,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X14703067 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4404498 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(14)70306-7/fulltext https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4404498/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82259135.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(14)70306-7,25304622,10.1016/s2214-109x(14)70306-7,2067180295,PMC4404498,0,001-021-878-535-636; 003-503-688-633-520; 010-107-540-109-529; 012-658-171-732-406; 022-815-001-433-533; 023-253-468-826-853; 023-641-106-024-532; 026-673-603-987-888; 030-842-934-678-974; 031-717-393-411-938; 033-320-848-918-83X; 037-521-423-972-802; 040-986-541-472-436; 042-520-351-751-272; 044-149-570-148-667; 051-111-016-076-352; 056-511-906-389-689; 057-446-546-470-771; 064-589-050-555-204; 096-802-242-152-371; 137-167-686-874-354,20

Bellgard; Nigel Chartres; Gerald F. Watts; Steve D. Wilton; Sue Fletcher; Adam Hunter; Tom Snelling,"Clinical research is complex. The knowledge base is information and data rich where value and success depend upon focused, well designed connectivity of systems achieved through stakeholder collaboration. Quality data, information, and knowledge must be utilized in an effective, efficient, and timely manner to affect important clinical decisions and communicate health prevention strategies. In recent decades, it has become apparent that information communication technology (ICT) solutions potentially offer multidimensional opportunities for transforming health care and clinical research. However, it is also recognized that successful utilization of ICT in improving patient care and health outcomes depends on a number of factors such as the effective integration of diverse sources of health data; how and by whom quality data are captured; reproducible methods on how data are interrogated and reanalyzed; robust policies and procedures for data privacy, security and access; usable consumer and clinical user interfaces; effective diverse stakeholder engagement; and navigating the numerous eclectic and non-interoperable legacy proprietary health ICT solutions in hospital and clinic environments (1, 2). This is broadly termed health informatics (HI). We outline three scenarios from across the health spectrum where these issues are exemplified: (i) for a given clinical trial methodology and study design, the nature of how quality data is captured, by whom, how it is aggregated, reused and repurposed is just as critical as the data content itself. This becomes critical with the desire to simultaneously evaluate and optimize the effective and cost-effective use of new medications (3); (ii) in a systems biology context, clever strategies to combine disparate datasets at the gene, gene expression, protein as well as at a protein–protein interaction levels are essential to unlock underlying molecular mechanisms that affect routine clinical decisions (4); and (iii) in evidence-based medicine, encoding expert clinical knowledge into decision support systems and data standards for collecting diverse patient’s physiological measurements are critical to ensure effective cross jurisdictional data sharing for diseases (5). These three examples highlight the potential broad spectrum of the role of ICT in health. Simply stated, at one end of the spectrum, health ICT systems are critical for the routine day-to-day running of hospitals and clinics. These systems are used by various health stakeholders for a diverse range of clinical services and administrative procedures. More recently, there is an increasing demand to reuse and repurpose health data contained within these ICT systems for clinical research and reporting such as compliance, efficiency metrics, funding of health programs, epidemiological studies, and health promotion. On the other end of the spectrum, clinical research embeds ICT and its application involving bioinformaticians, biostatisticians, and analytic workflow environments within research projects. There is a growing demand to embed outputs of this research as evidence to inform health-care policy and improve clinical practice. The significant challenge is how we bridge these two ends of the spectrum. While the overall driver of improved patient outcomes is shared, the demands placed on available ICT systems for data capture, access, and analysis are usually beyond what they were originally designed for. We contend that the field of HI is the important bridge that delivers the promise spanning ICT spectrum in both health care and clinical research. We now explore the challenges in HI that need to be overcome.",5,,224,224,Decision support system; Health informatics; Health care; Health promotion; Data quality; Data sharing; Stakeholder engagement; Knowledge base; Knowledge management; Medicine,clinical practice; clinical research; health; informatics; information communication technology,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00224/full https://core.ac.uk/display/95820016 https://doaj.org/article/04605817a79940afb6009dd56d8025b3 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00224/full https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/comprehending-the-health-informatics-spectrum-grappling-with-syst https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5603612 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5603612 https://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/id/eprint/38668/ https://eprints.qut.edu.au/119669/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00224/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00224,28959687,10.3389/fpubh.2017.00224,2755000833,PMC5603612,0,008-914-701-728-582; 014-090-030-835-86X; 022-526-129-975-007; 026-851-811-074-767; 035-708-470-095-539; 036-034-286-052-65X; 041-367-381-241-543; 046-121-570-840-010; 059-074-094-358-25X; 061-310-931-506-875; 070-462-022-251-464; 076-107-040-612-261; 076-998-705-424-882; 091-105-276-942-413; 099-656-939-753-608; 122-148-566-372-490; 138-832-458-470-087,2

Decisions on how to apply non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing and travel restrictions should also be based on evidence. There are some experiential and mathematical modelling data for these interventions, but there is a lack of data on the social, ethical and behavioural aspects of these interventions in the literature. Therefore, our study aims to produce evidence to inform (non-pharmaceutical) interventions such as communications, quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, travel restrictions and other public health measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study will be conducted in the United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand. We propose to conduct 600-1000 quantitative surveys and 25-35 qualitative interviews per country. Data collection will follow the following four themes: (1) Quarantine and self-isolation (2) social distancing and travel restrictions (3) wellbeing and mental health (4) information, misinformation and rumours. In light of limitations of travel and holding in-person meetings, we will primarily use online/remote methods for collecting data. Study participants will be adults who have provided informed consent from different demographic, socio-economic and risk groups. Discussion: At the time of the inception of the study, United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand have initiated strict public health measures and varying degrees of ""lockdowns"" to curb the pandemic. These public health measures will change in the coming weeks and months depending on the number of cases of COVID-19 in the respective countries. The data generated from our study could inform these strategies in real time.",5,5,90,90,Data collection; Mental health; Public health; Psychology; Social distance; Psychological intervention; Misinformation; Public relations; Informed consent; Pandemic,COVID-19; Italy; Malaysia; Thailand; United Kingdom; ethics; qualitative; social,,,Horizon 2020; Wellcome Trust,https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/1123922 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-90 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/1115278 https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-680848 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-90/v2/pdf https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/1115278 https://www.tropmedres.ac/publications/1115278 https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15813.2 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355217 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-90/v1/xml https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355217 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1115278 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32704548/ https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4657730 https://core.ac.uk/download/326247465.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15813.1,32704548,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15813.1; 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15813.2,3021223431,PMC7355217,0,004-210-689-597-602; 005-246-301-681-594; 021-647-780-229-032; 024-074-065-738-587; 041-586-009-952-162; 044-286-440-741-797; 053-784-055-833-642; 059-398-195-656-230; 063-014-267-382-902; 073-345-019-790-551; 086-358-167-687-147; 087-036-518-204-018; 123-185-302-096-110; 127-173-585-681-949,10

Methods: EUFIND combined consensus workshops and data sharing for multisite analysis, focusing on 7 core topics: clinical applications/clinical research, highest resolution anatomy, functional imaging, vascular systems/vascular pathology, iron mapping and neuropathology detection, spectroscopy, and quality assurance. Across these topics, EUFIND considered standard operating procedures, safety, and multivendor harmonization. Results: The clinical and research opportunities and challenges of 7T MRI in each subtopic are set out as a roadmap. Specific MRI sequences for each subtopic were implemented in a pilot study presented in this report. Results show that a large multisite 7T imaging network with highly advanced and harmonized imaging sequences is feasible and may enable future multicentre ultrahigh-field MRI studies and clinical trials. Discussion: The EUFIND network can be a major driver for advancing clinical neuroimaging research using 7T and for identifying use-cases for clinical applications in neurodegeneration.",11,1,538,549,Functional imaging; Medical physics; Dementia; Data sharing; Vascular pathology; Ultrahigh field; Research opportunities; Computer science; Clinical trial; Neuroimaging,Alzheimer's disease (AD); Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Mild cognitive impairment (MCI); Parkinson's disease (PD); Subjective cognitive decline (SCD); Ultrahigh-field MRI; Vascular dementia,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M008983/1) United Kingdom,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352872919300375 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31388558 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02299779/document https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/389934 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10079877/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31388558 https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1016/j.dadm.2019.04.010 https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1041582 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/1041582 https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/european-ultrahigh-field-imaging-network-for-neurodegenerative-di https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31388558/ http://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/1874/389934/1/duzel.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.dadm.2019.04.010 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F389934 https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/272479cd-e296-4817-ad09-0efbad8da5f9 https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/en/publications/european-ultrahighfield-imaging-network-for-neurodegenerative-diseases-eufind(272479cd-e296-4817-ad09-0efbad8da5f9).html https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/4b5a956c-8a69-3764-a8ec-3b35c9e4816e/ https://iris.unige.it/handle/11567/1024458 https://pr.ibs.re.kr/handle/8788114/6258 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02299779,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dadm.2019.04.010,31388558,10.1016/j.dadm.2019.04.010,2966095247,PMC6675944,0,000-145-010-402-079; 001-106-575-419-091; 003-126-101-677-372; 003-809-418-457-557; 004-993-497-301-241; 006-831-885-669-516; 008-308-314-201-991; 013-544-882-307-327; 015-459-896-783-208; 015-528-024-144-536; 019-143-865-896-845; 020-798-450-711-581; 021-194-135-192-629; 022-468-211-429-723; 022-806-153-615-518; 022-827-871-624-112; 022-980-651-829-504; 028-121-558-488-496; 028-493-357-273-453; 029-852-111-313-329; 031-414-479-221-002; 031-479-843-298-231; 032-457-607-519-513; 033-128-948-061-335; 033-253-770-689-477; 034-077-283-592-121; 039-113-882-390-289; 039-274-637-832-79X; 039-897-845-575-338; 040-513-391-776-724; 040-595-214-798-326; 041-222-456-792-220; 043-675-178-690-631; 053-599-418-683-520; 062-173-492-919-122; 062-966-264-886-859; 063-354-056-293-070; 068-838-889-882-761; 074-439-530-947-126; 075-914-818-200-837; 077-146-574-183-869; 077-290-443-188-367; 082-546-924-701-659; 085-432-867-504-299; 089-007-437-170-004; 089-564-114-521-334; 092-317-968-767-629; 093-569-822-969-436; 096-057-770-291-407; 100-495-338-876-601; 101-470-905-845-357; 103-632-611-595-147; 110-069-419-110-174; 113-416-221-628-851; 113-475-964-754-947; 114-489-073-235-004; 117-494-961-559-475; 122-929-499-848-349; 128-630-580-225-749; 157-873-481-745-907; 165-158-895-939-936; 166-612-374-894-545,14

This study describes the prevalence of health and nutrition claims on the front-of-pack of food products in retail stores in Mexico and estimate the potential effects of the Official Mexican Standards 051 (new regulation that includes specifications for implementing warning labels and other packaging elements such as health and nutrition claims on less healthy foods) on the prevalence of these claims. This is a cross-sectional study in which health and nutrition claims, nutrition information panels, and the list of ingredients of all foods and beverages available in the main retail stores in Mexico City were collected. The products were grouped by level of processing according to the NOVA food system classification. Claims were classified using the internationally harmonized INFORMAS taxonomy. According to the criteria of the new Mexican front-of-pack labelling regulation, the effect on the reduction on the prevalence of health and nutrition claims was estimated by type of food and by energy and nutrients of concern thresholds. Of 17,264 products, 33.8% displayed nutrition claims and 3.4% health claims. In total, 80.8% of all products in the Mexican market were classified as “less healthy”; 48.2% of products had excess calories, 44.6% had excess sodium, and 40.7% excess free sugars. The new regulation would prevent 39.4% of products with claims from displaying health and nutrition claims (P < 0.001); the largest reduction is observed for ultra-processed foods (51.1%, P < 0.001). The regulation thresholds that resulted in the largest reduction of claims were calories (OR 0.62, P < 0.001) and non-sugar sweeteners (OR 0.54, P < 0.001). The new Mexican front-of-pack labelling regulation will prevent most processed and ultra-processed foods from displaying health and nutrition claims and will potentially improve information on packaging for consumers.",18,1,76,76,Business; Clinical nutrition; Food choice; Misinformation; Excess sodium; Mexico city; Calorie; Food systems; Health claims on food labels; Environmental health,Health claims; Nutrient profile; Nutrition claims; Ultra-processed foods,Cross-Sectional Studies; Fast Foods; Food Analysis; Food Labeling/legislation & jurisprudence; Food Packaging/legislation & jurisprudence; Health Promotion; Humans; Legislation as Topic; Mexico; Nutritive Value,,Bloomberg Philanthropies; International Development Research Centre,https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-021-01148-1 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-56289/v1 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12966-021-01148-1 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-56289/v1.pdf?c=1631865195000 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12966-021-01148-1.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34112183 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8194035,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12966-021-01148-1,34112183,10.1186/s12966-021-01148-1,3118491133,PMC8194035,0,003-007-961-703-380; 003-148-762-264-978; 004-689-725-395-854; 006-968-089-609-421; 007-102-823-612-334; 008-350-828-230-326; 012-196-273-700-452; 018-694-367-494-741; 024-513-460-863-451; 025-022-661-432-543; 028-338-902-894-600; 035-315-530-239-278; 039-591-908-723-528; 044-507-651-445-871; 044-755-303-423-863; 045-112-394-660-967; 046-186-506-505-450; 047-717-888-891-858; 048-302-154-433-833; 048-858-783-593-024; 048-944-333-458-117; 051-795-214-689-571; 052-521-485-609-674; 052-887-155-200-725; 054-339-248-705-39X; 054-496-896-060-752; 056-950-804-198-093; 058-286-155-669-19X; 064-436-565-303-199; 065-155-549-411-910; 065-188-762-318-986; 067-908-031-682-763; 072-370-348-093-915; 075-271-764-862-248; 080-059-479-157-622; 082-511-498-311-067; 087-162-065-558-151; 087-337-592-505-221; 089-180-694-304-041; 094-236-203-287-55X; 096-114-782-166-433; 099-868-658-820-223; 107-947-299-148-722; 111-865-012-718-456; 115-840-677-554-251; 118-061-809-921-428; 122-236-949-706-996; 126-855-721-411-065; 134-270-885-387-678; 150-005-006-461-767; 173-366-899-144-803,1

METHODS: Allergen-IgE screening using ImmunoCAP ISAC(�) assay was performed at age 11 yrs in children participating a population-based birth cohort. Logistic regression (LR) and nonlinear statistical learning models, including random forests (RF) and Bayesian networks (BN), coupled with feature selection approaches, were used to identify patterns of allergen responses associated with asthma, rhino-conjunctivitis, wheeze, eczema and airway hyper-reactivity (AHR, positive methacholine challenge). Sensitivity/specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) were used to assess model performance via repeated validation. RESULTS: Serum sample for IgE measurement was obtained from 461 of 822 (56.1%) participants. Two hundred and thirty-eight of 461 (51.6%) children had at least one of 112 allergen components IgE > 0 ISU. The binary threshold >0.3 ISU performed less well than using continuous IgE values, discretizing data or using other data transformations, but not significantly (p = 0.1). With the exception of eczema (AUROC~0.5), LR, RF and BN achieved comparable AUROC, ranging from 0.76 to 0.82. Dust mite, pollens and pet allergens were highly associated with asthma, whilst pollens and dust mite with rhino-conjunctivitis. Egg/bovine allergens were associated with eczema. CONCLUSIONS: After validation, LR, RF and BN demonstrated reasonable discrimination ability for asthma, rhino-conjunctivitis, wheeze and AHR, but not for eczema. However, further improvements in threshold ascertainment and/or value transformation for different components, and better interpretation algorithms are needed to fully capitalize on the potential of the technology.",25,1,71,79,Immunoglobulin E; Logistic regression; Predictive value of tests; Immunology; Asthma; Wheeze; Allergen; Population; Receiver operating characteristic; Medicine,Bayesian networks; IgE; airway hyper-reactivity; asthma; children; component-resolved diagnostics; feature selection; logistic regression; machine learning; methacholine; random forests; rhinitis; wheeze,"Allergens/immunology; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Asthma/diagnosis; Automation, Laboratory; Bronchial Hyperreactivity/diagnosis; Bronchial Provocation Tests; Child; Cohort Studies; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Female; Humans; Hypersensitivity/diagnosis; Immunoglobulin E/blood; Male; Microarray Analysis/methods; Population Groups; Precision Medicine; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results",Allergens; Immunoglobulin E,Medical Research Council (G0601361) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_PC_13042) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K002449/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K006665/1) United Kingdom,https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/27073/2/Challenges%20in%20interpreting%20allergen%20microarrays%20in%20relation%20to%20clinical%20symptoms%3a%20a%20machine%20learning%20approach.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC4282342 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pai.12139/abstract https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24131308/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24131308 https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:230113 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/challenges-in-interpreting-allergen-microarrays-in-relation-to-clinical-symptoms(b56fc10e-9cdd-4d2c-a874-b760252c6307).html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pai.12139,24131308,10.1111/pai.12139,2169161566,PMC4282342,0,004-289-743-727-784; 014-620-571-273-607; 019-424-534-888-307; 021-575-952-653-930; 022-234-690-923-056; 031-043-979-228-69X; 033-056-650-109-471; 035-448-426-331-743; 044-297-948-671-631; 046-700-778-145-523; 055-697-013-395-979; 060-659-308-074-359; 062-118-208-868-187; 062-773-822-277-10X; 064-768-512-866-650; 065-543-923-208-643; 067-579-202-238-460; 073-934-448-764-699; 091-360-080-642-396; 100-133-958-521-483; 105-356-294-554-011; 112-718-708-492-367; 123-498-859-171-509; 170-404-937-781-957; 192-138-439-778-316,46

The searches were limited to papers published in the English language from 2001 to 2011.; ; Results: A total of 2917 titles were screened. From these, 18 papers describing the views of HCPs about data linkage or data sharing of routinely collected healthcare data at an individual patient level were included. Views were generally positive, and potential benefits were reported. Facilitators included having trust in the system including data governance, reliability, and feedback. Some negative views, identified as barriers were also expressed including costs, data governance, technical issues, and privacy concerns. Effects on the physician–patient relationship, and workload were also identified as deterrent.; ; Discussion: From the published literature included in this review, the views of HCPs were in general positive towards data sharing for public health purposes. The identification of barriers to contributing to a data linkage system allows these to be addressed in a planned data linkage project for pharmacovigilance. The main barriers identified were concerns about costs, governance and interference with the prescriber–patient relationship.

We largely share their concerns, and we did indeed mention some of them briefly in our Policy Forum. Our discussion pertained to all types of data, many or most of which do not include any personal information or do not involve individuals or humans in any way. For example, environmental genomics data generated through public funding should become available shortly after generation and should enjoy unrestricted usage. As we acknowledged in the Policy Forum, when it comes to personal data, issues of privacy, confidentiality, and informed consent need to be considered carefully and the best arrangements may vary on a case-by-case basis. It makes sense to anticipate these issues before data collection begins and to aim for research designs and informed consent forms that allow maximal, prompt, open use of valuable data.; ; We agree with Nicol et al. that public release of data may affect distribution of burdens and benefits across and within populations, and this is something that should be closely monitored. However, we think that usually more openness would diminish the inadvertent concentration of informational power in the hands of select for-profit enterprises that may wish to hoard data for their own advantage. Conversely, the public release of data may offer more value for the public and more widely distributed benefits of science.; ; The list of author affiliations is available at [www.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/350/suppl/DC1][1].; ;  [1]: http://www.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/350/suppl/DC1",364,6439,446,446,Internet privacy; Data collection; Personally identifiable information; Political science; Power (social and political); Value (ethics); Data sharing; Informed consent; Confidentiality; Openness to experience,,Informed Consent,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/E025080/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000771/1) United Kingdom,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6439/446.full https://eprints.qut.edu.au/209474/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31048484 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:2dee31d https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6439/446 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/31048484 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019Sci...364..446A/abstract https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax7509,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aax7509,31048484,10.1126/science.aax7509,2943524929,,0,,3

At this time of crisis, it is more important than ever for scientists around the world to openly share their knowledge, expertise, tools, and technology. Scientific models are critical tools for anticipating, predicting, and responding to complex biological, social, and environmental crises, including pandemics. They are essential for guiding regional and national governments in designing health, social, and economic policies to manage the spread of disease and lessen its impacts. However, presenting modeling results alone is not enough. Scientists must also openly share their model code so that the results can be replicated and evaluated.; ; Given the necessity for rapid response to the coronavirus pandemic, we need many eyes to review and collectively vet model assumptions, parameterizations, and algorithms to ensure the most accurate modeling possible. Transparency engenders public trust and is the best defense against misunderstanding, misuse, and deliberate misinformation about models and their results. We need to engage as many experts as possible for improving the ability of models to represent epidemiological, social, and economic dynamics so that we can best respond to the crisis and plan effectively to mitigate its wider impacts.; ; We strongly urge all scientists modeling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its consequences for health and society to rapidly and openly publish their code (along with specifying the type of data required, model parameterizations, and any available documentation) so that it is accessible to all scientists around the world. We offer sincere thanks to the many teams that are already sharing their models openly. Proprietary black boxes and code withheld for competitive motivations have no place in the global crisis we face today.

Dove,"Biobanks are a key emerging biomedical research infrastructure. They manifest the turn towards greater global sharing of genomic and health-related data, which is considered by many to be an ethical and scientific imperative. Our collective interests lie in improving the health and welfare of individuals, communities, and populations; improving health and welfare requires access to, and use of, widely dispersed quality data. But sharing these individual and familial data requires in turn that due thought be given to the ethical and legal interests at stake. Most critically, data sharing must occur in an environment whereby privacy interests are safeguarded throughout the lifecycle of biobank initiatives, and regardless of the locations where the data are stored, to which they are sent, and where they are ultimately processed. In this article, I outline the complex dimensions of data privacy regulation that challenge data sharing within the biobanking context.

Chami; Sebastian E. Ahnert; Narcis B. Kabatereine; Edridah M. Tukahebwa,"Community health interventions often seek to intentionally destroy paths between individuals to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Immunizing individuals through direct vaccination or the provision of health education prevents pathogen transmission and the propagation of misinformation concerning medical treatments. However, it remains an open question whether network-based strategies should be used in place of conventional field approaches to target individuals for medical treatment in low-income countries. We collected complete friendship and health advice networks in 17 rural villages of Mayuge District, Uganda. Here we show that acquaintance algorithms, i.e., selecting neighbors of randomly selected nodes, were systematically more efficient in fragmenting all networks than targeting well-established community roles, i.e., health workers, village government members, and schoolteachers. Additionally, community roles were not good proxy indicators of physical proximity to other households or connections to many sick people. We also show that acquaintance algorithms were effective in offsetting potential noncompliance with deworming treatments for 16,357 individuals during mass drug administration (MDA). Health advice networks were destroyed more easily than friendship networks. Only an average of 32% of nodes were removed from health advice networks to reduce the percentage of nodes at risk for refusing treatment in MDA to below 25%. Treatment compliance of at least 75% is needed in MDA to control human morbidity attributable to parasitic worms and progress toward elimination. Our findings point toward the potential use of network-based approaches as an alternative to role-based strategies for targeting individuals in rural health interventions.",114,36,201700166,E7431,Health education; Psychological intervention; Community health; Misinformation; Friendship; Rural health; Human morbidity; Socioeconomics; Medicine; Social network; Environmental health,community health; immunization; mass drug administration; percolation; social networks,Algorithms; Friends; Health Education/statistics & numerical data; Health Personnel; Humans; Immunization Programs/statistics & numerical data; Infection Control/statistics & numerical data; Mass Drug Administration/statistics & numerical data; Parasitic Diseases/prevention & control; Public Health/statistics & numerical data; Rural Population; Social Support; Treatment Refusal/statistics & numerical data; Uganda,,Wellcome Trust (083931/Z/07/Z) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28739906 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28739906 http://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/E7425 https://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/E7425 https://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/publications/1032023 https://core.ac.uk/display/132211010 http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1700166114 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/269572 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28739906/ https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/36/E7425.full.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132211010.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1700166114,28739906,10.1073/pnas.1700166114,2736981072,PMC5594644,0,000-906-912-920-100; 002-674-786-704-994; 002-777-336-731-153; 006-524-078-719-943; 008-105-662-002-753; 008-474-736-367-864; 009-587-145-573-065; 010-153-208-612-656; 011-760-076-189-876; 018-814-147-267-436; 019-807-904-465-351; 024-661-451-253-20X; 027-739-799-159-00X; 028-167-608-040-926; 029-662-189-560-402; 032-883-615-086-297; 037-503-855-278-778; 037-905-416-355-26X; 043-117-570-987-791; 048-367-999-904-083; 052-355-301-465-266; 054-794-653-558-631; 055-110-073-710-162; 060-130-648-144-202; 060-312-398-611-02X; 062-196-758-277-617; 063-190-811-897-241; 070-258-869-018-15X; 070-824-720-050-235; 078-468-335-032-164; 079-517-152-769-184; 083-132-155-113-102; 098-827-107-481-029; 108-107-807-481-180; 109-508-231-629-413; 124-017-217-197-252; 134-764-067-008-090; 149-881-542-072-508; 152-898-652-228-170; 171-310-402-084-37X; 179-729-483-673-013; 192-626-517-413-13X,28

Public health,24682667,Elsevier BV,England,David A Ellis; Ross McQueenie; Alex McConnachie; Philip Wilson; Andrea E Williamson,"<AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Addressing the causes of low engagement in health care is a prerequisite for reducing health inequalities. People who miss multiple appointments are an under-researched group who might have substantial unmet health needs. Individual-level patterns of missed general practice appointments might thus provide a risk marker for vulnerability and poor health outcomes. We sought to ascertain the contributions of patient and practice factors to the likelihood of missing general practice appointments.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">For this national retrospective cohort analysis, we extracted UK National Health Service general practice data that were routinely collected across Scotland between Sept 5, 2013, and Sept 5, 2016. We calculated the per-patient number of missed appointments from individual appointments and investigated the risk of missing a general practice appointment using a negative binomial model offset by number of appointments made. We then analysed the effect of patient-level factors (including age, sex, and socioeconomic status) and practice-level factors (including appointment availability and geographical location) on the risk of missing appointments.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"">The full dataset included information from 909 073 patients, of whom 550 083 were included in the analysis after processing. We observed that 104 461 (19·0%) patients missed more than two appointments in the 3 year study period. After controlling for the number of appointments made, patterns of non-attendance could be differentiated, with patients who were aged 16-30 years (relative risk ratio [RRR] 1·21, 95% CI 1·19-1·23) or older than 90 years (2·20, 2·09-2·29), and of low socioeconomic status (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation decile 1: RRR 2·27, 2·22-2·31) significantly more likely to miss multiple appointments. Men missed fewer appointments overall than women, but were somewhat more likely to miss appointments in the adjusted model (1·05, 1·04-1·06). Practice factors also substantially affected attendance patterns, with urban practices in affluent areas that typically have appointment waiting times of 2-3 days the most likely to have patients who serially miss appointments. The combination of both patient and practice factors to predict appointments missed gave a higher pseudo R<sup>2</sup> value (0·66) than models using either group of factors separately (patients only R<sup>2</sup>=0·54; practice only R<sup>2</sup>=0·63).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""INTERPRETATION"">The findings that both patient and practice characteristics contribute to non-attendance of general practice appointments raise important questions for both the management of patients who miss multiple appointments and the effectiveness of existing strategies that aim to increase attendance. Addressing these issues should lead to improvements in provision of services and public health.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""FUNDING"">Scottish Government Chief Scientist Office and Data Sharing and Linkage Service of the Scottish Government.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

The clinical indications for genomic testing have evolved markedly; the volume of clinical sequencing has increased dramatically; and the range of clinical professionals involved in the process has broadened. There is general acceptance that our early dichotomous paradigms of variants being pathogenic–high risk and benign–no risk are overly simplistic. There is increasing recognition that the clinical interpretation of genomic data requires significant expertise in disease–gene-variant associations specific to each disease area. Inaccurate interpretation can lead to clinical mismanagement, inconsistent information within families and misdirection of resources. It is for this reason that ‘national subspecialist multidisciplinary meetings’ (MDMs) for genomic interpretation have been articulated as key for the new NHS Genomic Medicine Service, of which Cancer Variant Interpretation Group UK (CanVIG-UK) is an early exemplar. CanVIG-UK was established in 2017 and now has >100 UK members, including at least one clinical diagnostic scientist and one clinical cancer geneticist from each of the 25 regional molecular genetics laboratories of the UK and Ireland. Through CanVIG-UK, we have established national consensus around variant interpretation for cancer susceptibility genes via monthly national teleconferenced MDMs and collaborative data sharing using a secure online portal. We describe here the activities of CanVIG-UK, including exemplar outputs and feedback from the membership.",57,12,829,834,Psychology; Multidisciplinary approach; Geneticist; Data sharing; Subspecialty; Personalized medicine; Service (systems architecture); Family medicine; Interpretation (philosophy); Medical genetics,clinical genetics; genetics; guidelines; molecular genetics; oncology,Female; Genetic Testing; Genetic Variation/genetics; Genomics; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Ireland/epidemiology; Male; Neoplasms/epidemiology; United Kingdom/epidemiology,,Department of Health (RP-2016-07-011) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (C61296/A27223) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7691806 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32170000 https://jmg.bmj.com/content/early/2020/03/13/jmedgenet-2019-106759 https://jmg.bmj.com/content/57/12/829 https://rde.dspace-express.com/handle/11287/621380 https://jmg.bmj.com/content/jmedgenet/57/12/829.full.pdf https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/cancer-variant-interpretation-group-uk-canviguk(d6e55b37-9b64-4823-871f-6f541f3f6f8e).html https://repository.icr.ac.uk/handle/internal/3572 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/184587758/829.full.pdf https://rde.dspace-express.com/bitstream/11287/621380/1/open%20access%20article%2032.pdf https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/cancer-variant-interpretation-group-uk-canviguk-an-exemplar-national-subspecialist-multidisciplinary-network(20038a3f-5b4f-49bf-963f-c7b6092ee45e).html http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7691806 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/289262304.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106759,32170000,10.1136/jmedgenet-2019-106759,3006340694,PMC7691806,0,002-021-098-047-523; 013-240-333-952-646; 015-307-411-123-672; 023-206-981-583-774; 023-474-058-772-740; 026-529-011-967-369; 029-268-206-974-530; 036-148-935-075-217; 040-686-297-934-453; 044-268-993-713-244; 056-087-334-996-255; 058-539-888-777-692; 067-636-610-317-748; 068-550-132-613-92X; 087-513-306-685-541; 094-073-323-941-428; 107-996-742-549-880; 118-824-284-197-678; 121-444-718-949-237; 127-016-670-476-238; 150-636-772-497-17X,8

It is evident, however, that researchers and bioinformaticians struggle to navigate the various standards and to find the appropriate database to collect, manage, and share data. Further, policy makers, funders, and publishers lack sufficient information to formulate their guidelines. In this paper, we highlight a number of key issues that can be used to turn these challenges into new opportunities.

Areas of public and animal health as well as food safety would benefit from rapid data sharing when it comes to emergencies. However, ethical, regulatory and institutional challenges, as well as lack of suitable platforms which provide an infrastructure for data sharing in structured formats, often lead to data not being shared or at most shared in form of supplementary materials in journal publications.

Miller; Kieran Rustage; Neal Russell; Jon S. Friedland; Sally Hargreaves,"Abstract Background Undocumented migrant women experience complex barriers to maternity services, are less likely to receive the recommended level of maternity care, and have poorer obstetric outcomes than non-migrant women. There are concerns increasing restrictions on entitlement to health services have a detrimental impact on access to services and obstetric outcomes, particularly among undocumented migrant women. The study aimed to investigate the experiences of undocumented migrant women who have been pregnant in England, and factors affecting access to care and health outcomes. Methods We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews June–December 2017 with a purposive sample of migrant women born outside the UK (aged>18) who had experiences of pregnancy and undocumented status (without permission to reside) in the UK, recruited through Doctors of the World (DOTW) UK. Interpreting services were used on request. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Ethical approval: Imperial College London Research Ethics Committee (ICREC reference: 17IC3924). Results Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 participants, 10 of whom had their first antenatal appointment after the national target of 13 weeks, and nine of whom reported complications. Themes defining women's experiences of pregnancy included: restricted agency, intersecting stressors, and an ongoing cycle of precarity, defined by legal status, social isolation, and economic status. Conclusions This study provides new evidence of women's experiences of pregnancy in the UK in the context of increasingly restrictive health policies including charging and data sharing. Six recommendations are made to ensure the UK and other migrant receiving countries work towards reducing inequalities and achieving national and global targets for maternal and child health and universal health coverage.",270,,113610,113610,Entitlement; Agency (sociology); Sociology; Socioeconomic status; Research ethics; Qualitative research; Social isolation; Context (language use); Family medicine; Thematic analysis,Health inequalities; Maternal health; Migrant health; Refugees; Undocumented migrants,Adolescent; Child; England; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; London; Maternal Health Services; Pregnancy; Qualitative Research; State Medicine; Transients and Migrants,,Department of Health (NIHR300072) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7895812/ http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33383485/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620308297 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7895812 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33383485/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v270y2021ics0277953620308297.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113610,33383485,10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113610,3111984787,PMC7895812,0,001-566-783-080-712; 003-622-074-939-893; 004-200-388-338-376; 004-294-997-499-554; 005-589-495-914-636; 007-526-882-304-269; 008-568-728-926-053; 009-690-645-675-741; 010-813-875-542-605; 011-264-362-945-924; 011-413-106-562-277; 012-066-813-721-671; 014-673-302-175-004; 014-797-090-044-17X; 015-413-157-125-777; 015-682-685-610-00X; 020-527-964-335-136; 020-612-655-378-112; 024-057-450-489-236; 026-109-295-924-721; 030-062-695-006-208; 030-412-132-629-193; 031-345-380-174-713; 033-656-347-135-318; 035-351-749-075-536; 035-442-851-091-990; 035-477-726-590-686; 037-550-015-414-716; 038-764-819-710-457; 039-511-803-118-900; 041-627-531-456-143; 043-841-639-244-193; 043-884-991-722-430; 046-811-306-295-568; 049-545-112-031-783; 051-219-387-445-641; 053-614-206-569-69X; 054-272-896-975-861; 055-961-366-560-925; 056-235-250-931-405; 056-530-067-250-494; 058-104-157-899-255; 058-205-346-973-250; 060-079-334-098-943; 061-855-542-809-450; 062-354-748-554-802; 064-502-102-430-469; 067-532-348-004-378; 068-102-351-401-100; 069-410-907-341-301; 072-187-161-593-746; 072-206-951-565-484; 073-004-536-428-424; 077-577-682-256-556; 079-049-509-165-160; 079-941-246-052-822; 080-939-317-597-938; 085-655-186-033-813; 088-030-417-813-518; 093-841-587-061-080; 100-177-532-281-771; 102-929-865-251-919; 110-816-194-130-196; 124-974-270-459-076; 125-341-003-959-996; 125-361-940-385-956; 126-657-244-203-441; 126-794-732-626-567; 129-352-226-522-731; 140-302-044-017-083; 149-370-349-141-925; 150-551-359-681-528; 178-539-369-290-090; 180-813-779-294-458; 187-872-985-873-922,7

This linkage could be the basis for identification of adverse drug reactions. The aim of this article is to report the views of healthcare professionals on data sharing, ownership and the legal and other applicable frameworks relevant to linkage of routinely collected paediatric healthcare data. Design Qualitative study using semistructured face-to-face interviews addressing the study aims. Participants Purposive sample of professional stakeholders (n=25) including experts on ethics, data protection, pharmacovigilance, data linkage, legal issues and prescribing. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed using a framework approach. Results Participants identified existing data sharing systems in the UK. Access to healthcare data should be approved by the data owners. The definition of data ownership and associated legal responsibilities for linked healthcare data were seen as important factors to ensure accountability for the use of linked data. Yet data owners were seen as facilitators of the proposed data linkage. Twelve frameworks (legal, regulatory and governance) applicable to the linkage of healthcare data were identified. Conclusions A large number of potentially relevant legal and regulatory frameworks were identified. Ownership of the linked data was seen as an extension of responsibility for, or guardianship of, the source datasets. The consensus emerging from the present study was that clarity is required on the definition of data sharing, data ownership and responsibilities of data owners.",4,2,e003875,,Health informatics; Health care; Qualitative research; Community health; Data sharing; Public relations; Legal guardian; Linked data; Data Protection Act 1998; Medicine,Data Linkage; Data Ownership; Data Sharing; Pharmacovigilance; Prescribing,Access to Information/ethics; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Attitude of Health Personnel; Child; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Electronic Health Records/ethics; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Interviews as Topic; Medical Record Linkage; Pharmacovigilance; Qualitative Research; Scotland; State Medicine,,Chief Scientist Office (ARPG/07/04) United Kingdom,http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3162/1/Interview_BMJOPen.pdf https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/linked-health-data-for-pharmacovigilance-in-children-perceived-le https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/2/e003875 http://aura-test.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/3162 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC3927931 https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/3162 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/4/2/e003875.full.pdf https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/3580/ https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003875 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/2/e003875.full.pdf+html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24523422 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/244818 https://core.ac.uk/download/29016958.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003875,24523422,10.1136/bmjopen-2013-003875,2109129109,PMC3927931,0,002-781-791-771-837; 004-531-079-438-118; 006-423-108-940-284; 006-634-521-100-780; 009-419-392-015-156; 009-562-557-124-820; 017-864-372-772-42X; 019-543-706-660-264; 019-975-381-960-566; 020-346-436-264-239; 022-216-489-117-926; 028-815-627-844-834; 033-640-741-658-487; 036-473-129-875-219; 037-158-987-746-794; 042-944-839-271-677; 043-292-204-769-127; 045-049-612-403-821; 045-668-482-367-553; 047-544-365-851-758; 047-904-650-956-563; 050-644-476-889-376; 050-828-071-734-823; 051-300-902-326-638; 052-384-233-522-507; 055-862-898-564-894; 057-471-110-155-10X; 062-698-936-962-642; 067-496-724-025-354; 069-328-783-448-883; 071-876-141-330-591; 095-715-420-316-219; 102-894-094-119-487; 106-365-502-193-03X; 107-464-625-272-950; 111-087-649-232-607; 113-011-947-892-947; 132-071-991-235-630; 159-399-449-926-262; 163-149-395-997-446,4

One of these challenges is determining the model of consent that should support the sharing of human biological samples and data in the context of international collaborative research. In this paper, we report on the views of key research stakeholders in Ghana on what should count as good ethical practice when seeking consent for genomic research and biobanking in Africa. This study was part of a multi-country qualitative case study conducted in three African countries: Ghana, Uganda and Zambia under the auspices of the Human Heredity and Health in Africa initiative (H3Africa). Our study suggests that while participants are willing to give consent for their samples and associated data to be used for future research purposes, they expect to receive feedback about the progress of the research and about the kinds of research being undertaken on their samples and data. These expectations need to be anticipated and discussed during the consent process which should be seen as part of an ongoing communication process throughout the research process.",31,1,200,215,Biobank; Sociology; Data sharing; Context (language use); Research process; Human heredity; Genomic research; Public relations; Process (engineering); Informed consent,Africa; Broad consent; data sharing; genomic research feedback of findings; sample sharing,,,Wellcome Trust; Wellcome Trust,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/11287462.2020.1717896 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7734033 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343193 https://philpapers.org/rec/TINICI-3 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/11287462.2020.1717896 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/7450392d-611d-3cd3-bee3-b2ab2252e820/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33343193/ https://core.ac.uk/download/288396435.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11287462.2020.1717896,33343193,10.1080/11287462.2020.1717896,3006979711,PMC7734033,0,002-477-078-207-396; 003-163-253-628-417; 004-306-915-294-949; 004-613-862-207-388; 005-012-445-454-882; 010-494-004-999-583; 010-573-184-794-352; 010-938-575-860-707; 012-458-257-629-868; 012-516-713-058-003; 015-006-294-481-120; 015-053-505-151-458; 015-761-762-235-078; 017-563-649-888-152; 017-847-712-271-900; 018-681-209-481-264; 023-075-238-839-895; 024-612-035-047-967; 025-926-015-812-113; 026-354-553-648-432; 036-138-099-943-445; 037-093-679-560-520; 041-599-780-183-400; 042-284-059-765-333; 043-238-582-252-339; 046-530-575-176-240; 048-610-154-684-207; 048-912-199-333-412; 049-592-247-090-598; 052-322-297-207-668; 060-183-433-104-114; 066-443-825-278-283; 069-029-068-683-235; 069-435-831-842-361; 075-434-996-850-338; 125-810-717-283-966; 138-783-514-027-453; 139-690-209-514-355,7

Kurinczuk; Maria A Quigley,"Objectives To explore why and how fertility patients decide to allow (or deny) the use of personal data held in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority registry for linkage and research. Design A qualitative study was conducted using in-depth face-to-face interviews and an online survey to garner information on experience and opinions from fertility clinic patients and staff. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using the ‘one sheet of paper’ method to identify themes. Setting Women and men were recruited between September 2015 and December 2017, via fertility clinics across England and online advertising, then interviewed at a location convenient to them. Participants 20 patients and 9 staff were interviewed, 40 patients completed the online survey. Results Consent for disclosure (CD) forms are completed at a stressful time, when patients often feel overwhelmed; these forms were considered a low priority. Perceptions of benefit (to individuals, to wider society) and harm (misuse of data, impact of disclosure on child) influenced consent. Important themes included: understanding of the forms; trust in those asking, in researchers, in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA); and wider attitudes to data use. Issues influencing response, and thus the representativeness of the HFEA data set, were highlighted. Conclusions Understanding what is being asked, and trust in those organisations keeping and using personal data, affects individual decisions to consent to disclosure. Patients were influenced by the wider context of infertility, as well as general concerns about data sharing and security. Low consent rates, which vary by clinic and likely also by patients’ characteristics, have adverse implications for research conducted using HFEA data collected after 2008. Public understanding of data use and security is relatively poor; increased public trust in, and awareness of, research based on routine data could improve consent to data use and reduce the risk of bias.",9,5,e026469,,Record linkage; Qualitative research; Fertility clinic; Harm; Public trust; Data sharing; Context (language use); Family medicine; Fertility; Medicine,assisted reproductive technologies; consent; data sharing; fertility; record linkage,Adult; Confidentiality; England; Female; Humans; Infertility/psychology; Information Dissemination; Informed Consent; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Qualitative Research; Registries; Surveys and Questionnaires; Trust,,Medical Research Council (MR/L019671/1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6549633 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31152033 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/5/e026469.full https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/5/e026469 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/5/e026469.full.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31152033/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31152033 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/988687,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-026469,31152033,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-026469,2942557828,PMC6549633,0,000-380-458-641-115; 003-092-235-403-69X; 005-097-092-089-052; 011-569-487-815-661; 012-713-132-168-24X; 013-371-284-553-138; 020-524-104-037-16X; 023-630-814-307-986; 023-926-046-812-033; 024-034-907-450-795; 031-540-312-730-611; 038-309-113-387-411; 041-166-847-536-597; 054-268-565-502-005; 085-320-250-288-390; 092-045-409-790-615; 095-655-751-874-977; 106-518-103-065-887; 139-916-304-340-700; 170-016-370-362-617; 178-717-124-761-324,4

Ideal validation for such methods is application to simulated data, where some 'truth' is known. As GWAS increase in size, so does the computational complexity of such evaluations; standard practice repeatedly simulates and analyses genotype data for all individuals in an example study. Results We have developed a novel method based on an alternative approach, directly simulating GWAS summary data, without individual data as an intermediate step. We mathematically derive the expected statistics for any set of causal variants and their effect sizes, conditional upon control haplotype frequencies (available from public reference datasets). Simulation of GWAS summary output can be conducted independently of sample size by simulating random variates about these expected values. Across a range of scenarios, our method, produces very similar output to that from simulating individual genotypes with a substantial gain in speed even for modest sample sizes. Fast simulation of GWAS summary statistics will enable more complete and rapid evaluation of summary statistic methods as well as opening new potential avenues of research in fine mapping and gene set enrichment analysis.

Logan; Peter I. Croucher; Graham R. Williams; J. H. Duncan Bassett,"The genetic determinants of osteoporosis remain poorly understood, and there is a large unmet need for new treatments in our ageing society. Thus, new approaches for gene discovery in skeletal disease are required to complement the current genome-wide association studies in human populations. The International Knockout Mouse Consortium (IKMC) and the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) provide such an opportunity. The IKMC generates knockout mice representing each of the known protein-coding genes in C57BL/6 mice and, as part of the IMPC initiative, the Origins of Bone and Cartilage Disease project identifies mutants with significant outlier skeletal phenotypes. This initiative will add value to data from large human cohorts and provide a new understanding of bone and cartilage pathophysiology, ultimately leading to the identification of novel drug targets for the treatment of skeletal disease.",231,1,R31,46,Gene; Internal medicine; Phenotype; Endocrinology; Knockout mouse; Genetic association; International Knockout Mouse Consortium; Osteoporosis; Disease; Cartilage; Genetics; Computational biology; Biology,bone; gene discovery; genetics; osteoporosis,"Animals; Bone Diseases/genetics; Bone and Bones/physiopathology; Cartilage Diseases/genetics; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout/genetics; Phenotype",,Wellcome Trust (101123) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (094134) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC5064764 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27535945/ http://joe.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/joe/231/1/R31.xml https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/39207 https://joe.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/joe/231/1/R31.xml https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/39207/2/2016%20FREUDENTHAL%20Journal%20of%20Endocrinology%20OBCD%20Review.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5064764 https://joe.bioscientifica.com/downloadpdf/journals/joe/231/1/R31.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27535945,http://dx.doi.org/10.1530/joe-16-0258,27535945,10.1530/joe-16-0258,2512876120,PMC5064764,0,001-438-991-099-120; 001-544-011-261-436; 001-669-811-164-772; 002-406-876-897-442; 004-905-893-279-688; 006-600-118-599-336; 006-764-257-706-892; 006-819-160-597-867; 007-481-725-173-57X; 008-612-132-601-341; 008-871-275-724-257; 009-368-323-329-533; 009-441-363-094-087; 009-553-909-559-760; 012-069-789-162-550; 012-962-659-017-007; 013-158-511-063-575; 013-365-718-470-292; 014-258-976-455-944; 015-190-512-013-257; 015-539-270-922-165; 016-422-552-637-28X; 017-244-590-480-401; 017-308-827-168-521; 018-256-424-477-201; 019-176-806-947-72X; 019-219-814-676-672; 019-306-573-916-676; 019-830-344-770-723; 020-996-621-296-472; 021-392-824-473-634; 021-741-293-933-605; 021-764-704-458-055; 022-016-634-652-970; 022-335-134-560-971; 022-790-686-545-483; 023-082-092-588-514; 023-187-422-295-206; 023-288-698-609-23X; 023-381-901-279-130; 023-902-602-291-835; 024-019-313-967-628; 024-287-757-021-017; 024-456-991-978-276; 024-537-875-097-193; 024-769-342-218-995; 025-267-406-026-797; 027-884-593-821-61X; 029-789-533-467-046; 030-872-101-751-580; 033-130-320-268-19X; 033-396-075-387-758; 033-641-715-292-498; 035-262-554-521-394; 036-248-014-584-891; 039-091-686-920-25X; 040-793-142-821-976; 042-265-066-319-426; 043-084-225-397-784; 043-926-250-942-957; 044-037-818-639-202; 044-174-912-847-543; 044-326-195-786-863; 045-472-912-451-225; 046-021-186-915-104; 046-632-926-668-798; 047-981-008-742-401; 048-002-646-094-036; 048-320-858-133-045; 049-409-611-104-602; 050-448-715-887-928; 050-768-201-483-005; 051-001-714-534-069; 054-667-460-207-526; 058-050-364-631-138; 058-817-870-762-393; 059-473-894-283-979; 059-976-135-086-178; 063-151-655-479-264; 063-261-695-354-244; 063-265-878-519-329; 063-266-362-808-431; 064-828-166-324-171; 065-245-944-542-063; 072-966-110-858-057; 073-475-067-231-055; 075-428-588-773-811; 079-211-030-036-570; 079-230-016-212-463; 079-571-260-225-763; 081-697-628-786-645; 082-274-328-939-023; 084-521-068-231-587; 086-142-090-716-241; 086-864-705-158-018; 089-458-136-216-681; 091-146-413-164-429; 098-741-701-380-979; 099-258-918-357-952; 099-961-465-276-299; 102-531-917-687-707; 105-348-030-834-714; 105-356-275-192-609; 107-635-260-331-148; 109-259-171-430-378; 116-576-445-357-546; 124-785-736-104-54X; 128-279-492-219-247; 128-524-731-178-734; 131-717-330-819-552; 134-082-126-331-093; 134-796-424-974-745; 148-022-011-611-195; 156-997-609-274-701; 163-522-335-979-599; 169-890-649-970-965; 171-234-618-990-425,27

Jack; Philippe G. Schyns,"As a highly social species, humans frequently exchange social information to support almost all facets of life. One of the richest and most powerful tools in social communication is the face, from which observers can quickly and easily make a number of inferences — about identity, gender, sex, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical health, attractiveness, emotional state, personality traits, pain or physical pleasure, deception, and even social status. With the advent of the digital economy, increasing globalization and cultural integration, understanding precisely which face information supports social communication and which produces misunderstanding is central to the evolving needs of modern society (for example, in the design of socially interactive digital avatars and companion robots). Doing so is challenging, however, because the face can be thought of as comprising a high-dimensional, dynamic information space, and this impacts cognitive science and neuroimaging, and their broader applications in the digital economy. New opportunities to address this challenge are arising from the development of new methods and technologies, coupled with the emergence of a modern scientific culture that embraces cross-disciplinary approaches. Here, we briefly review one such approach that combines state-of-the-art computer graphics, psychophysics and vision science, cultural psychology and social cognition, and highlight the main knowledge advances it has generated. In the light of current developments, we provide a vision of the future directions in the field of human facial communication within and across cultures.",25,14,R621,34,Social status; Cognitive science; Digital economy; Social competence; Identity (social science); Cultural psychology; Deception; Face (sociological concept); Social cognition; Biology,,Communication; Face/anatomy & histology; Female; Humans; Male,,Medical Research Council (ESRC/MRC-060-25-0010) United Kingdom,http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/108192/ https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(15)00655-7 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960982215006557 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215006557 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26196493 https://core.ac.uk/display/42363424 http://www.cell.com/current-biology/references/S0960-9822(15)00655-7 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26196493,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.05.052,26196493,10.1016/j.cub.2015.05.052,1932659519,,0,000-128-197-265-582; 000-741-786-703-486; 001-012-718-837-091; 001-177-756-177-608; 001-662-042-109-637; 001-757-260-755-786; 003-158-248-027-135; 003-162-566-935-173; 004-039-090-993-222; 004-118-003-474-797; 005-193-901-447-690; 005-230-813-337-125; 005-249-560-624-846; 005-638-846-150-569; 006-036-995-509-852; 006-102-428-592-146; 006-247-258-408-541; 006-549-186-493-954; 006-677-719-660-812; 006-760-967-734-531; 007-154-851-019-380; 007-370-019-551-930; 009-443-147-219-657; 009-861-898-386-976; 010-048-270-214-128; 010-214-049-832-593; 010-929-485-058-871; 011-235-885-478-349; 013-021-964-571-348; 014-144-955-980-138; 015-396-217-117-604; 015-807-780-099-541; 017-369-664-726-910; 017-418-039-674-500; 018-719-357-563-297; 019-447-262-606-071; 019-452-401-692-835; 019-660-252-049-059; 019-958-849-131-647; 020-876-175-071-268; 021-392-288-164-749; 023-455-482-409-189; 023-873-929-115-577; 024-168-657-611-886; 025-655-384-503-015; 025-938-908-747-062; 026-370-479-531-366; 026-850-349-288-647; 026-852-713-453-987; 027-661-279-881-106; 028-375-014-793-484; 028-659-949-144-206; 029-706-716-018-79X; 031-303-742-744-475; 031-739-544-199-354; 031-982-030-430-782; 031-996-050-028-106; 033-953-521-579-696; 034-149-158-554-062; 035-522-074-408-50X; 036-002-832-145-428; 036-110-945-806-614; 036-571-582-318-081; 037-106-721-559-786; 037-359-705-346-938; 037-467-971-254-452; 037-660-034-854-618; 038-858-881-186-93X; 038-952-135-523-413; 039-867-583-845-918; 041-744-883-158-513; 042-433-518-496-31X; 042-743-663-469-506; 044-061-510-577-404; 045-099-635-379-25X; 046-182-132-842-824; 048-528-348-681-650; 048-816-825-228-725; 050-962-572-392-152; 052-074-984-363-937; 052-306-032-297-960; 052-565-229-368-693; 055-958-789-598-530; 056-085-057-295-59X; 056-314-616-885-833; 057-433-809-370-367; 059-436-440-239-858; 059-846-716-395-248; 059-863-664-938-515; 060-228-790-985-243; 060-387-113-634-049; 061-191-941-521-092; 061-759-222-284-974; 061-905-827-605-366; 064-416-498-151-085; 066-140-731-426-777; 067-623-003-818-433; 067-872-041-138-065; 067-920-037-838-601; 069-033-787-466-503; 070-372-140-885-32X; 072-196-204-457-790; 074-017-562-218-104; 074-172-997-323-982; 075-312-166-060-948; 075-412-204-654-551; 076-595-292-362-137; 077-301-607-551-275; 079-877-386-096-831; 081-083-341-882-940; 084-247-614-712-232; 084-771-134-113-354; 085-446-638-444-779; 085-911-427-294-011; 086-551-561-571-913; 088-937-650-192-178; 089-581-544-778-193; 090-172-794-954-565; 090-530-590-260-577; 091-037-170-034-925; 091-045-150-206-849; 094-459-875-746-382; 096-025-174-863-505; 096-768-977-909-797; 096-770-966-868-283; 096-895-477-204-098; 096-982-792-680-946; 097-805-629-072-114; 098-119-610-747-165; 098-476-709-445-445; 098-601-708-177-522; 099-632-529-644-963; 100-445-736-404-719; 100-557-697-898-74X; 100-897-813-807-122; 101-289-709-999-31X; 101-336-236-562-028; 101-821-923-206-657; 102-770-807-661-352; 105-291-930-568-162; 107-397-474-726-275; 109-049-959-995-934; 109-817-085-711-919; 111-134-562-875-908; 111-922-524-234-955; 113-646-608-960-297; 114-004-724-140-044; 114-587-299-904-10X; 116-827-484-166-754; 117-506-379-731-765; 117-860-236-462-360; 121-940-479-914-442; 122-977-901-586-030; 123-510-624-208-37X; 124-967-113-892-858; 126-150-883-186-358; 127-077-505-339-300; 127-766-230-223-766; 127-959-255-784-034; 131-628-259-839-037; 133-384-686-447-93X; 135-786-033-510-633; 137-535-239-037-657; 138-340-449-294-068; 139-434-407-685-697; 142-152-539-080-668; 144-011-929-209-387; 145-287-609-710-707; 146-881-984-369-860; 147-932-817-056-262; 149-229-185-800-505; 151-658-115-015-103; 151-888-796-819-556; 154-199-103-256-419; 160-171-523-157-655; 161-571-610-528-142; 163-360-131-262-802; 164-555-677-492-614; 165-667-475-254-434; 166-390-922-041-076; 168-995-010-372-037; 169-434-263-343-951; 172-654-167-854-690; 184-913-637-355-036; 184-989-413-632-47X; 188-258-270-148-088; 197-486-648-581-440,131

Advances in omics, in silico approaches and alternative assays are providing opportunities to enhance our understanding of embryo-fetal development and the prediction of potential risks associated with the use of medicines in pregnancy. A workshop organised by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), ""Predicting the Safety of Medicines in Pregnancy - a New Era?"", was attended by delegates representing regulatory authorities, academia, industry, patients, funding bodies and software developers to consider how to improve the quality of and access to nonclinical developmental toxicity data and how to use this data to better predict the safety of medicines in human pregnancy. The workshop delegates concluded that based on comparative data to date alternative methodologies are currently no more predictive than conventional methods and not qualified for use in regulatory submissions. To advance the development and qualification of alternative methodologies, there is a requirement for better coordinated multidisciplinary cross-sector interactions coupled with data sharing. Furthermore, a better understanding of human developmental biology and the incorporation of this knowledge into the development of alternative methodologies is essential to enhance the prediction of adverse outcomes for human development. The output of the workshop was a series of recommendations aimed at supporting multidisciplinary efforts to develop and validate these alternative methodologies.",93,,199,210,Risk analysis (engineering); Business; Health care; Multidisciplinary approach; Pregnancy; Quality (business); Data sharing; Human development (humanity); Adverse Outcome Pathway; Regulatory agency,Adverse outcome pathway; Alternative assay; Data sharing; Embryo-fetal development; In silico; Medicines regulation; Predictive models; Pregnancy,"Adverse Outcome Pathways; Animal Testing Alternatives; Animals; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Drug and Narcotic Control; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Female; Humans; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Pregnancy; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Toxicity Tests",,Medical Research Council (MR/L006758/1) United Kingdom,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F397164 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32126282/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890623820300241 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/397164 https://rivm.openrepository.com/handle/10029/623941 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32126282 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0890623820300241,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.reprotox.2020.02.011,32126282,10.1016/j.reprotox.2020.02.011,3009723099,,0,004-207-436-967-903; 004-360-772-686-263; 004-826-935-470-670; 004-879-100-038-619; 007-128-484-926-448; 007-393-315-555-17X; 010-032-403-297-769; 012-433-410-201-016; 016-562-105-630-128; 017-351-698-982-239; 022-707-115-340-45X; 022-953-036-526-073; 025-764-915-534-391; 026-960-399-272-325; 034-169-389-591-15X; 035-336-592-471-534; 036-088-636-903-48X; 036-182-932-215-164; 038-903-878-236-828; 039-417-009-904-962; 040-379-217-476-668; 040-393-061-391-246; 040-398-592-118-743; 049-422-706-993-824; 053-446-672-652-482; 054-296-090-853-837; 054-724-901-467-226; 056-985-965-650-060; 064-014-486-279-258; 064-239-495-085-591; 065-494-225-034-545; 066-492-588-483-398; 068-288-177-724-358; 069-269-682-637-776; 070-582-021-401-471; 075-652-207-387-850; 087-372-734-254-311; 093-941-884-146-193; 097-417-673-981-556; 102-711-451-844-413; 108-693-328-481-68X; 166-569-068-011-379; 191-873-244-467-74X,4

However, concerns surrounding security and trustworthiness impede the collection of large-scale representative medical data, posing a considerable challenge for training a well-generalised model in clinical practices. To address this, we launch the Unified CT-COVID AI Diagnostic Initiative (UCADI), where the AI model can be distributedly trained and independently executed at each host institution under a federated learning framework (FL) without data sharing. Here we show that our FL model outperformed all the local models by a large yield (test sensitivity /specificity in China: 0.973/0.951, in the UK: 0.730/0.942), achieving comparable performance with a panel of professional radiologists. We further evaluated the model on the hold-out (collected from another two hospitals leaving out the FL) and heterogeneous (acquired with contrast materials) data, provided visual explanations for decisions made by the model, and analysed the trade-offs between the model performance and the communication costs in the federated training process. Our study is based on 9,573 chest computed tomography scans (CTs) from 3,336 patients collected from 23 hospitals located in China and the UK. Collectively, our work advanced the prospects of utilising federated learning for privacy-preserving AI in digital health.",,,,,Trustworthiness; Artificial intelligence; Host (network); Data sharing; Digital health; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Privacy preserving; Computer science; Process (engineering); Medical diagnosis,,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NCI NIH HHS (U01 CA242879) United States,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09461 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2111.09461 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8609899 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2111.html#abs-2111-09461 https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09461,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34815983,34815983,,3213704721,PMC8609899,0,000-786-310-596-151; 004-846-926-633-528; 005-407-582-462-957; 006-525-291-185-674; 013-399-687-630-366; 014-609-581-433-005; 018-344-208-518-697; 020-194-910-495-916; 020-233-013-143-936; 020-955-421-653-411; 021-320-870-378-715; 022-208-608-057-402; 023-373-397-759-062; 025-838-108-932-173; 028-219-218-402-655; 033-974-621-078-357; 034-462-900-246-779; 037-358-764-964-256; 038-418-958-067-586; 042-240-098-526-453; 054-655-764-078-93X; 056-421-297-149-17X; 060-480-337-496-438; 061-388-229-678-968; 062-023-936-838-515; 062-757-492-324-822; 067-642-226-476-462; 072-550-959-925-272; 075-043-262-118-369; 081-698-071-321-609; 097-254-407-417-22X; 097-524-263-703-282; 097-793-829-799-89X; 097-973-896-649-38X; 100-371-211-473-19X; 101-366-592-780-82X; 107-251-936-891-75X; 113-656-456-686-987; 121-607-188-834-419; 131-970-678-538-494; 139-552-118-652-140; 142-421-702-320-979; 145-108-829-550-497; 146-418-815-371-236; 160-047-026-196-962; 166-593-301-710-660; 175-837-589-249-90X; 178-361-790-436-158; 179-117-103-385-443; 184-388-908-098-500; 186-667-394-948-292; 187-784-763-443-572,0

Makowski; Rickmer Braren; Daniel Rueckert; Ben Glocker; Georgios Kaissis; Jonathan Passerat-Palmbach,"Despite the rapid increase of data available to train machine-learning algorithms in many domains, several applications suffer from a paucity of representative and diverse data. The medical and financial sectors are, for example, constrained by legal, ethical, regulatory and privacy concerns preventing data sharing between institutions. Collaborative learning systems, such as federated learning, are designed to circumvent such restrictions and provide a privacy-preserving alternative by eschewing data sharing and relying instead on the distributed remote execution of algorithms. However, such systems are susceptible to malicious adversarial interference attempting to undermine their utility or divulge confidential information. Here we present an overview and analysis of current adversarial attacks and their mitigations in the context of collaborative machine learning. We discuss the applicability of attack vectors to specific learning contexts and attempt to formulate a generic foundation for adversarial influence and mitigation mechanisms. We moreover show that a number of context-specific learning conditions are exploited in similar fashion across all settings. Lastly, we provide a focused perspective on open challenges and promising areas of future research in the field. When the training data for machine learning are highly personal or sensitive, collaborative approaches can help a collective of stakeholders to train a model together without having to share any data. But there are still risks to the privacy of the data.

Donnelly,"Estimating temporal changes in a target population from phylogenetic or count data is an important problem in ecology and epidemiology. Reliable estimates can provide key insights into the climatic and biological drivers influencing the diversity or structure of that population and evidence hypotheses concerning its future growth or decline. In infectious disease applications, the individuals infected across an epidemic form the target population. The renewal model estimates the effective reproduction number, R, of the epidemic from counts of observed incident cases. The skyline model infers the effective population size, N, underlying a phylogeny of sequences sampled from that epidemic. Practically, R measures ongoing epidemic growth while N informs on historical caseload. While both models solve distinct problems, the reliability of their estimates depends on p-dimensional piecewise-constant functions. If p is misspecified, the model might underfit significant changes or overfit noise and promote a spurious understanding of the epidemic, which might misguide intervention policies or misinform forecasts. Surprisingly, no transparent yet principled approach for optimizing p exists. Usually, p is heuristically set, or obscurely controlled via complex algorithms. We present a computable and interpretable p-selection method based on the minimum description length (MDL) formalism of information theory. Unlike many standard model selection techniques, MDL accounts for the additional statistical complexity induced by how parameters interact. As a result, our method optimizes p so that R and N estimates properly and meaningfully adapt to available data.

James Rubin; Rebecca K. Webster; Antonia Rubin; Richard Amlôt; Nick Grey; Neil Greenberg,"Objectives To assess public attitudes towards data sharing to facilitate a mental health screening programme for people caught up in a mass casualty incident. Design Two, identical, cross-sectional, online surveys, using quotas to ensure demographic representativeness of people aged 18–65 years in England. Participants were randomly allocated to consider a scenario in which they witness a terrorism-related radiation incident or mass shooting, after which a police officer records their contact details. Setting Participants were drawn from an online panel maintained by a market research company. Surveys were conducted before and immediately after a series of terrorist attacks and a large tower block fire occurred in England. Participants One thousand people aged 18–65 years participated in each survey. Main outcome measures Three questions asking participants if it would be acceptable for police to share their contact details, without asking first, with ‘a health-related government organisation, so they can send you a questionnaire to find out if you might benefit from extra care or support’, ‘a specialist NHS team, to provide you with information about ways to get support for any physical or mental health issues’ and ‘your GP, so they can check how you are doing’. Results A minority of participants reported that it would be definitely not acceptable for their details to be shared with the government organisation (n=259, 13.0%), the National Health Service (NHS) (n=141, 7.1%) and their general practitioner (GP) (n=166, 8.3%). There was a small, but significant increase in acceptability for the radiation incident compared with the mass shooting. No major differences were observed between the preincident and postincident surveys. Conclusions Although most people believe it is acceptable for their details to be shared in order to facilitate a mental health response to a major incident, care must be taken to communicate with those affected about how their information will be used.",8,5,e022852,,Mental health; Cross-sectional study; Government; Market research; Officer; Data sharing; Mass-casualty incident; Representativeness heuristic; Family medicine; Medicine,data sharing; mass casualty incident; public attitudes; radiation; shooting; terrorism,Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; England; Female; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Male; Mass Casualty Incidents; Middle Aged; Privacy; Public Opinion; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,,Department of Health (HPRU-2012-10414) United Kingdom,http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/5/e022852 https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/159096/ https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/8/5/e022852.full.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29780033/ https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/5/e022852 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/5/e022852.full.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29780033 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29780033 https://core.ac.uk/download/305121881.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022852,29780033,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-022852,2803437943,PMC5961558,0,006-939-330-635-835; 008-196-848-604-767; 013-819-071-514-226; 027-785-551-282-458; 048-129-942-521-643; 052-016-388-903-399; 059-445-450-862-963,3

Jakob; Paul A. Wilson; Joerg Pross; Thomas H. G. Ezard; Jens Fiebig; Janne Repschläger; Oliver Friedrich,"Sea-level rise resulting from the instability of polar continental ice sheets represents a major socioeconomic hazard arising from anthropogenic warming, but the response of the largest component of Earth's cryosphere, the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), to global warming is poorly understood. Here we present a detailed record of North Atlantic deep-ocean temperature, global sea-level, and ice-volume change for ∼2.75 to 2.4 Ma ago, when atmospheric partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) ranged from present-day (>400 parts per million volume, ppmv) to preindustrial (<280 ppmv) values. Our data reveal clear glacial-interglacial cycles in global ice volume and sea level largely driven by the growth and decay of ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere. Yet, sea-level values during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 101 (∼2.55 Ma) also signal substantial melting of the EAIS, and peak sea levels during MIS G7 (∼2.75 Ma) and, perhaps, MIS G1 (∼2.63 Ma) are also suggestive of EAIS instability. During the succeeding glacial-interglacial cycles (MIS 100 to 95), sea levels were distinctly lower than before, strongly suggesting a link between greater stability of the EAIS and increased land-ice volumes in the Northern Hemisphere. We propose that lower sea levels driven by ice-sheet growth in the Northern Hemisphere decreased EAIS susceptibility to ocean melting. Our findings have implications for future EAIS vulnerability to a rapidly warming world.",117,49,30980,30987,Physical geography; Global warming; Ice sheet; Geology; Quaternary; Cryosphere; Northern Hemisphere; Antarctic ice sheet; Marine isotope stage; Sea level,East Antarctic Ice Sheet; intensification of Northern Hemisphere Glaciation; ocean-cryosphere interaction; sea level,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; European Union; ECORD; NERC,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33229561/ https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=202102221211142381 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7733790 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PNAS..11730980J/abstract https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33229561 https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_3279995 https://www.pnas.org/content/117/49/30980 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33229561 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/445406/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004209117,33229561,10.1073/pnas.2004209117,3108675108,PMC7733790,0,001-711-086-644-20X; 002-119-002-840-152; 002-458-182-146-091; 003-555-183-972-353; 004-716-299-453-011; 005-617-685-340-480; 005-915-445-800-113; 006-550-599-127-774; 006-893-423-427-452; 009-421-706-912-400; 010-446-760-005-12X; 010-576-913-000-609; 010-591-103-239-402; 011-084-069-418-641; 013-267-864-384-019; 013-578-643-489-528; 017-000-439-059-779; 017-095-734-403-637; 018-273-907-191-798; 018-943-409-020-689; 019-302-381-735-071; 020-333-639-155-62X; 021-281-609-404-845; 022-976-244-648-667; 027-537-781-912-635; 029-622-730-355-698; 029-666-460-060-770; 030-029-756-254-877; 031-680-203-436-207; 035-283-732-604-460; 038-145-300-239-598; 038-341-971-199-337; 040-511-270-194-032; 040-640-573-980-162; 040-688-117-091-399; 044-273-410-422-83X; 044-951-645-023-008; 049-410-640-585-87X; 050-301-173-056-153; 050-734-243-012-943; 051-466-769-018-088; 055-289-915-710-840; 056-418-943-646-465; 058-211-606-236-769; 061-310-059-712-843; 062-788-405-223-081; 065-703-089-140-674; 069-086-142-129-429; 071-042-697-141-445; 075-401-016-185-918; 075-882-422-264-179; 077-130-755-829-212; 079-534-437-315-21X; 084-963-286-743-968; 086-996-248-837-983; 087-001-861-565-718; 088-938-512-103-661; 092-318-337-147-233; 093-263-937-768-544; 100-719-450-366-660; 101-114-466-720-892; 104-781-765-850-257; 106-076-045-736-586; 109-967-238-395-181; 110-551-233-689-718; 113-687-527-754-281; 115-112-952-664-936; 117-425-322-809-635; 126-789-123-649-53X; 134-004-549-180-705; 135-350-773-491-397; 137-639-606-838-998; 143-484-504-899-806; 148-005-717-327-992; 149-284-653-904-48X; 150-325-162-873-23X; 155-685-297-598-694; 172-677-036-334-320,4

Mutations in 18 genes that encode components of GPI-anchor biogenesis result in a phenotypic spectrum that includes learning disability, epilepsy, microcephaly, congenital malformations and mild dysmorphic features. To determine the incidence of GPI-anchor defects, we analysed the exome data from 4293 parent-child trios recruited to the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) study. All probands recruited had a neurodevelopmental disorder. We searched for variants in 31 genes linked to GPI-anchor biogenesis and detected rare biallelic variants in PGAP3, PIGN, PIGT (n=2), PIGO and PIGL, providing a likely diagnosis for six families. In five families, the variants were in a compound heterozygous configuration while in a consanguineous Afghani kindred, a homozygous c.709G>C; p.(E237Q) variant in PIGT was identified within 10-12 Mb of autozygosity. Validation and segregation analysis was performed using Sanger sequencing. Across the six families, five siblings were available for testing and in all cases variants co-segregated consistent with them being causative. In four families, abnormal alkaline phosphatase results were observed in the direction expected. FACS analysis of knockout HEK293 cells that had been transfected with wild-type or mutant cDNA constructs demonstrated that the variants in PIGN, PIGT and PIGO all led to reduced activity. Splicing assays, performed using leucocyte RNA, showed that a c.336-2A>G variant in PIGL resulted in exon skipping and p.D113fs*2. Our results strengthen recently reported disease associations, suggest that defective GPI-anchor biogenesis may explain ~0.15% of individuals with developmental disorders and highlight the benefits of data sharing.",25,6,669,679,Exome; Compound heterozygosity; Proband; Microcephaly; Exon skipping; Neurodevelopmental disorder; Genetics; Medical genetics; Sanger sequencing; Biology,,"Acyltransferases/genetics; Adult; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Child; Developmental Disabilities/genetics; Exome; HEK293 Cells; Heterozygote; Homozygote; Humans; Membrane Proteins/genetics; N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/genetics; Pedigree; Phosphotransferases/genetics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics","Membrane Proteins; PIGO protein, human; Receptors, Cell Surface; Acyltransferases; COOH-terminal signal transamidase; N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases; PIGN protein, human; Phosphotransferases; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; PGAP3 protein, human; PIGL protein, human",Wellcome Trust (090532/Z/09/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT098051) United Kingdom; Department of Health United Kingdom,https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg201732.pdf https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/publications/686838 https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg201732 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/407611/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28327575 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28327575 https://core.ac.uk/download/131246187.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ejhg.2017.32,28327575,10.1038/ejhg.2017.32,2603634354,PMC5477361,0,001-176-773-225-291; 001-293-871-032-517; 001-709-220-116-414; 004-604-265-419-919; 005-345-008-564-667; 006-486-408-270-727; 006-871-098-910-370; 010-025-283-154-898; 011-808-264-004-146; 012-369-194-998-185; 012-576-258-437-099; 014-271-963-696-470; 015-307-411-123-672; 015-765-658-573-673; 017-682-146-611-92X; 018-573-404-273-446; 018-749-201-948-93X; 018-795-046-897-577; 020-418-472-470-347; 022-290-727-098-392; 022-671-399-938-143; 024-051-701-812-919; 024-292-988-457-068; 025-865-548-242-452; 027-962-030-524-698; 032-153-417-998-696; 032-599-521-569-679; 033-749-410-352-95X; 035-664-890-331-858; 037-814-896-563-717; 043-535-499-759-201; 045-613-896-389-439; 046-067-611-192-925; 048-644-825-194-037; 048-685-816-250-683; 053-445-947-347-942; 056-200-465-221-216; 058-280-569-704-496; 064-633-374-207-236; 065-105-294-827-782; 067-605-824-514-155; 068-321-110-141-651; 069-643-726-648-344; 079-675-055-153-111; 081-552-643-034-153; 085-616-105-619-037; 086-267-013-181-561; 086-616-634-338-528; 108-159-905-796-009; 110-785-433-904-867; 126-368-122-664-759; 127-016-670-476-238; 136-864-268-941-419,48

B. Erskine; Emma Dures; Neil McHugh; Sarah Hewlett,"Background: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis affecting the joints and connective tissue. According to the common-sense model (CSM), patients develop illness beliefs when faced with new symptoms, which determine their emotional and behavioural response to the condition. The CSM includes five beliefs: identify, cause, timeline and control. These are important determinants of outcomes and have been shown to influence adherence to medication.; ; Methods: A secondary analysis of eight focus groups held across five hospital sites and comprising 41 participants was undertaken. Participants were sampled for a range of phenotypes and domains of disease activity: men=20 and women=21; mean age=58 years (SD 11.4); mean disease duration=9 years (SD 8.3); mean HAQ=1 (SD 0.7). ; ; Results: The analysis provided evidence to support the existence of the five illness beliefs among patients with PsA, and evidence that these representations affected the way patients engaged with their condition. The results showed that many participants experienced high levels of uncertainty in relation to the illness representation. The role of external social and environmental factors was also shown influenced participants’ illness representations and the way they made sense of their PsA. ; ; Conclusion: This research highlights a new theme of uncertainty within illness representations and how this impacts on the way in which people living with PsA manage their condition. A greater understanding of the high levels of uncertainty that patients might have about their condition and its treatment could provide clinicians with an opportunity to address misinformed or erroneous illness representations and ambivalence about treatment.",2,2,rky023,,Ambivalence; Psoriatic arthritis; Inflammatory arthritis; Arthritis; Psoriasis; Spondylarthropathies; Focus group; Clinical psychology; Medicine; Secondary data,behaviour; common-sense model; illness representation; patient attitude to health; psychology and social phenomena; rheumatic diseases; spondylarthropathies,,,Versus Arthritis (20867) United Kingdom; Department of Health (RP-PG-1212-20007) United Kingdom,https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/865089 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6649914/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31431969 https://academic.oup.com/rheumap/article/2/2/rky023/5068132 http://academic.oup.com/rheumap/article-abstract/2/2/rky023/5068132 http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/36905/ https://core.ac.uk/download/323892616.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/rap/rky023,31431969,10.1093/rap/rky023,2887148333,PMC6649914,0,001-137-139-119-764; 002-250-601-005-048; 008-952-667-588-412; 010-133-994-140-36X; 013-984-757-893-207; 021-055-742-517-595; 030-227-616-419-032; 037-550-015-414-716; 037-580-481-063-519; 044-309-165-513-851; 053-637-046-380-776; 063-668-758-522-60X; 069-768-824-951-207; 083-688-628-198-120; 094-953-136-587-262; 096-147-861-270-272; 123-504-198-742-228; 147-106-975-794-899; 175-293-000-047-772; 179-682-335-576-910; 188-428-375-820-204,3

Recent studies have elucidated the role of EVs in intercellular communication, pathogenesis, drug, vaccine and gene-vector delivery, and as possible reservoirs of biomarkers. These findings have generated immense interest, along with an exponential increase in molecular data pertaining to EVs. Here, we describe Vesiclepedia, a manually curated compendium of molecular data (lipid, RNA, and protein) identified in different classes of EVs from more than 300 independent studies published over the past several years. Even though databases are indispensable resources for the scientific community, recent studies have shown that more than 50% of the databases are not regularly updated. In addition, more than 20% of the database links are inactive. To prevent such database and link decay, we have initiated a continuous community annotation project with the active involvement of EV researchers. The EV research community can set a gold standard in data sharing with Vesiclepedia, which could evolve as a primary resource for the field.",10,12,1,5,Microvesicles; Annotation; Compendium; Data sharing;

As a result of improvements in sequencing technologies and novel analyses strategies, several of these have recently been deciphered. These efforts have generated new insights into Triticeae biology and genome organization and have important implications for downstream usage by breeders, experimental biologists, and comparative genomicists. transPLANT () is an EU-funded project aimed at constructing hardware, software, and data infrastructure for genome-scale research in the life sciences. Since the Triticeae data are intrinsically complex, heterogenous, and distributed, the transPLANT consortium has undertaken efforts to develop common data formats and tools that enable the exchange and integration of data from distributed resources.

Clegg; Andrea Cavallaro; Hamed Haddadi,"Motion sensors embedded in wearable and mobile devices allow for dynamic selection of sensor streams and sampling rates, enabling several applications, such as power management and data-sharing control. While deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve competitive accuracy in sensor data classification, DNNs generally process incoming data from a fixed set of sensors with a fixed sampling rate, and changes in the dimensions of their inputs cause considerable accuracy loss, unnecessary computations, or failure in operation. We introduce a dimension-adaptive pooling (DAP) layer that makes DNNs flexible and more robust to changes in sensor availability and in sampling rate. DAP operates on convolutional filter maps of variable dimensions and produces an input of fixed dimensions suitable for feedforward and recurrent layers. We also propose a dimension-adaptive training (DAT) procedure for enabling DNNs that use DAP to better generalize over the set of feasible data dimensions at inference time. DAT comprises the random selection of dimensions during the forward passes and optimization with accumulated gradients of several backward passes. Combining DAP and DAT, we show how to transform non-adaptive DNNs into a Dimension-Adaptive Neural Architecture (DANA), while keeping the same number of parameters. Compared to existing approaches, our solution provides better classification accuracy over the range of possible data dimensions at inference time and does not require up-sampling or imputation, thus reducing unnecessary computations. Experiments on seven datasets (four benchmark real-world datasets for human activity recognition and three synthetic datasets) show that DANA prevents significant losses in classification accuracy of the state-of-the-art DNNs and, compared to baselines, it better captures correlated patterns in sensor data under dynamic sensor availability and varying sampling rates.",5,3,1,27,Filter (signal processing); Activity recognition; Benchmark (computing); Dimension (vector space); Artificial intelligence; Multivariate statistics; Set (abstract data type); Pattern recognition; Data classification; Feed forward; Computer science; Sampling (statistics); Filter (signal processing); Activity recognition; Benchmark (computing); Dimension (vector space); Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Data classification; Adaptive sampling; Feed forward; Computer science; Sampling (statistics),,,,EPSRC,http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02397 https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02397 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02397.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200802397M/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3478074,,10.1145/3478074,3201303090; 3047467872,,0,002-487-938-526-928; 003-122-854-875-551; 003-727-641-151-228; 004-191-834-875-330; 006-615-856-834-176; 007-115-268-419-916; 007-459-489-786-380; 007-617-643-094-966; 008-649-035-392-663; 015-355-632-403-105; 016-165-840-216-135; 016-173-779-175-29X; 016-647-542-440-122; 020-450-040-724-454; 021-274-879-313-761; 021-326-533-295-625; 021-613-066-986-92X; 021-692-977-492-62X; 023-183-459-720-925; 023-267-459-805-513; 027-398-718-628-52X; 030-540-246-658-722; 035-184-748-054-519; 038-876-137-194-519; 041-277-356-259-953; 041-314-165-476-904; 041-590-027-919-835; 042-251-157-585-319; 042-569-434-890-507; 042-773-888-137-809; 042-813-608-770-719; 051-165-140-308-345; 053-094-537-530-97X; 054-537-082-667-377; 056-150-372-039-877; 061-987-558-880-512; 064-535-527-003-236; 067-623-656-459-343; 068-414-669-389-079; 070-115-768-111-488; 074-091-174-126-449; 081-454-650-975-390; 082-101-659-341-434; 084-510-831-812-921; 086-909-037-908-763; 091-492-177-865-216; 093-289-105-558-646; 093-433-881-015-218; 093-563-754-484-797; 096-684-588-855-395; 096-856-408-561-647; 097-524-263-703-282; 097-604-838-291-830; 102-449-833-603-745; 104-125-320-507-995; 104-408-792-128-299; 109-308-173-749-655; 111-270-234-203-201; 114-292-862-800-599; 116-769-698-631-428; 119-478-846-870-850; 120-968-518-916-079; 131-562-282-487-907; 134-746-163-318-364; 135-137-580-202-023; 142-461-141-801-487; 149-375-705-640-142; 150-546-338-298-857; 154-903-770-684-974; 161-311-558-946-185; 161-384-232-947-505; 161-599-806-082-634; 163-467-828-860-263; 180-126-146-432-860; 182-009-398-287-081; 187-784-763-443-572; 193-052-734-829-39X; 194-642-337-191-229; 196-441-056-369-328,2

To assess the extent of data sharing in favourable circumstances and whether data sharing checks can be automated, this article investigates summary statistics from primary human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This type of data is highly suitable for sharing because it is a standard research output, is straightforward to use in future studies (e.g., for secondary analysis), and may be already stored in a standard format for internal sharing within multi-site research projects. Manual checks of 1799 articles from 2010 and 2017 matching a simple PubMed query for molecular epidemiology GWAS were used to identify 314 primary human GWAS papers. Of these, only 13% reported the location of a complete set of GWAS summary data, increasing from 3% in 2010 to 23% in 2017. Whilst information about whether data was shared was typically located clearly within a data availability statement, the exact nature of the shared data was usually unspecified. Thus, data sharing is the exception even in suitable research fields with relatively strong data sharing norms. Moreover, the lack of clear data descriptions within data sharing statements greatly complicates the task of automatically characterising shared data sets.",15,2,e0229578,,Matching (statistics); Set (abstract data type); Data science; Statement (computer science); MEDLINE; Data sharing; Task (project management); Summary statistics; Computer science; Data set; Metadata,,"Biometry/methods; Databases, Genetic/statistics & numerical data; Genome-Wide Association Study/trends; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Research Report",,Medical Research Council (MC_UU_00011/7) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32084240 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/is-useful-research-data-usually-shared(5c6c1657-7c92-47ab-b3de-dedff2a7eb2c).html https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0229578 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32084240/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7034915 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32084240 https://wlv.openrepository.com/handle/2436/623085 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229578 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/232762411/untitled.pdf https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/is-useful-research-data-usually-shared-an-investigation-of-genome http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020PLoSO..1529578T/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0229578,32084240,10.1371/journal.pone.0229578,3007766288,PMC7034915,0,000-785-692-812-344; 001-788-981-268-621; 005-921-913-953-948; 006-143-760-275-725; 006-595-824-979-279; 008-210-788-681-346; 012-565-178-658-47X; 013-003-681-146-81X; 014-594-518-161-511; 015-094-327-785-722; 015-197-893-541-038; 016-513-542-264-372; 019-538-368-158-59X; 019-711-953-160-945; 021-026-755-886-653; 021-841-774-073-034; 021-946-221-379-43X; 028-479-110-487-379; 028-740-121-270-032; 029-075-157-960-691; 031-589-728-194-127; 032-273-388-354-416; 037-816-060-391-328; 040-827-527-628-192; 043-035-471-546-326; 043-754-919-265-460; 046-920-876-672-671; 050-908-240-821-013; 053-150-125-815-614; 055-221-005-118-839; 056-834-710-018-225; 057-459-965-882-028; 059-244-770-813-641; 059-402-420-924-609; 063-156-205-440-998; 074-614-949-934-346; 080-457-989-566-219; 081-249-813-936-319; 082-770-706-465-260; 083-147-550-827-377; 090-438-648-274-057; 090-768-913-164-353; 098-727-591-914-595; 106-939-259-059-104; 107-502-249-850-861; 114-821-904-083-913; 123-903-723-850-664; 132-370-308-081-244; 142-556-660-172-75X; 146-860-127-936-282; 148-103-885-981-474; 154-741-190-724-184; 158-382-354-589-147; 188-270-297-190-317,11

Barrington; Michel Meignan,"Increased tumor burden is associated with inferior outcomes in many lymphoma subtypes. Surrogates of tumor burden that are easy to measure, such as the maximum tumor dimension of the bulkiest lesion on CT, have been used as prognostic indices for many years. Recently, total metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and tumor lesion glycolysis have emerged as promising and robust biomarkers of outcome in various lymphomas. The median MTV and the optimal cutoffs to separate patients into risk groups in a study population are, however, highly dependent on the population characteristics and the delineation method used to outline tumor on the PET image. This issue has precluded the use of MTV for risk stratification in trials and clinical practice. Standardization of the methodology is timely to allow the potential for risk adaptation to be explored in addition to response adaptation using PET. Meetings between representatives from research groups active in the field were held under the auspices of the PET International Lymphoma and Myeloma Workshop. A summary of those discussions, which included a review of the literature and a practical assessment of methods used for outlining, including various software options, is presented. Finally, a proposal is made to perform a technical validation of MTV measurement enabling benchmark reference ranges to be derived for published delineation approaches used for outlining with various software. This process would require collation of representative imaging data sets of the most common lymphoma subtypes; agreement on pragmatic criteria for the selection of lesions; generation of a range of MTVs, with consensus to be reached on final contours in a training set; and development of automated software solutions with a set of minimum functionalities to reduce measurement variability. Methods developed in the above training exercise could then be applied to another data set, with a final set of contours and values generated. This final data set would provide a benchmark against which end-users could test their ability to measure MTVs that are consistent with expected values. The data set and automated software solutions could be shared with manufacturers with the aim of including these in standard workflows to allow standardization of MTV measurement across the world.",60,8,1096,1102,Benchmark (computing); Set (psychology); Workflow; Standardization; Medical physics; Software; Population; Computer science; Data set; Adaptation (computer science),lymphoma; positron emission tomography; standardization,"Congresses as Topic; Diagnostic Imaging/standards; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Hodgkin Disease/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnostic imaging; Medical Oncology/standards; Positron-Emission Tomography; Prognosis; Reference Standards; Risk Assessment/methods; Software; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Tumor Burden",Fluorodeoxyglucose F18,Department of Health (RP-2016-07-001) United Kingdom,http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/early/2019/04/11/jnumed.119.227249.full.pdf+html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6681699 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30954945 http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/60/8/1096.short http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/early/2019/04/11/jnumed.119.227249.abstract https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/jnumed/early/2019/04/11/jnumed.119.227249.full.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30954945/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.119.227249,30954945,10.2967/jnumed.119.227249,2927995861,PMC6681699,0,000-305-427-961-781; 000-414-536-956-052; 003-231-805-403-155; 007-110-098-778-090; 011-454-897-960-546; 011-796-214-869-71X; 012-060-494-033-136; 012-119-749-468-822; 013-008-040-146-468; 017-147-489-067-394; 017-689-303-641-893; 019-039-789-486-94X; 020-902-642-639-761; 021-104-159-501-594; 022-562-162-179-748; 023-765-584-007-707; 026-213-052-627-087; 027-064-239-584-056; 028-431-516-783-01X; 030-007-898-430-752; 031-001-652-702-665; 031-342-331-464-200; 031-900-194-803-432; 032-183-164-368-860; 035-597-599-699-924; 036-857-954-984-24X; 042-509-022-390-966; 042-743-610-175-117; 043-403-383-809-364; 048-058-362-312-161; 048-948-332-356-619; 049-815-438-262-28X; 051-418-919-519-86X; 051-433-339-533-660; 055-471-195-684-373; 059-870-971-725-515; 062-844-995-691-531; 063-757-235-047-402; 066-302-945-522-106; 067-545-876-221-563; 069-312-354-563-393; 069-372-169-042-398; 074-372-028-938-343; 074-578-864-387-931; 075-095-736-792-481; 075-923-990-726-042; 079-575-411-137-591; 080-363-249-070-19X; 083-038-822-449-531; 083-919-105-260-154; 086-010-392-985-979; 089-453-510-529-942; 091-783-562-070-233; 094-391-993-765-13X; 095-371-196-416-701; 096-736-218-614-393; 098-082-750-932-710; 101-168-759-073-688; 102-231-638-361-267; 103-743-750-581-863; 105-964-864-661-476; 108-424-961-667-839; 114-751-110-241-843; 117-332-718-454-145; 119-642-978-387-483; 121-717-764-400-959; 170-080-189-708-851,47

Willis; Paul Carder; Robert West; Robbie Foy,"Background: Recruitment of representative samples in primary care research is essential to ensure high-quality, generalisable results. This is particularly important for research using routinely recorded patient data to examine the delivery of care. Yet little is known about how different recruitment strategies influence the characteristics of the practices included in research. We describe three approaches for recruiting practices to data sharing studies, examining differences in recruitment levels and practice representativeness. Method: We examined three studies that included varying populations of practices from West Yorkshire, UK. All used anonymised patient data to explore aspects of clinical practice. Recruitment strategies were ‘opt-in’, ‘mixed opt-in and opt-out’, and ‘opt-out’. We compared aggregated practice data between recruited and not-recruited practices for practice list size, deprivation, chronic disease management, patient experience and rates of unplanned hospital admission. Results: The opt-out strategy had the highest recruitment (80%), followed by mixed (70%), and opt-in (58%). Practices opting-in were larger (median 7153 vs. 4722 patients, p=0.03) than practices that declined to opt-in. Practices recruited by mixed approach were larger (median 7091 vs. 5857 patients, p=0.04) and had differences in the clinical quality measure (58.4% vs 53.9% of diabetic patients with HbA1c <=59mmol/mol, p<0.01). We found no differences between practices recruited and not-recruited using the opt-out strategy for any demographic or quality-of-care measures. Conclusion: Opt-out recruitment appears to be a relatively efficient approach to ensuring participation of typical general practices. Researchers should, with appropriate ethical safeguards, consider opt-out recruitment of practices for studies involving anonymised patient data sharing.",33,2,200,204,Patient experience; Research design; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Primary care; Representativeness heuristic; Family medicine; Informed consent; Quality management; Medicine,Electronic health records; family practice; primary health care; quality improvement; research design; research subject recruitment.,Clinical Studies as Topic/methods; Electronic Health Records; Female; General Practice; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Informed Consent; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Selection; Primary Health Care; Research Design; United Kingdom,,Department of Health (RP-PG-1209-10040) United Kingdom,https://academic.oup.com/fampra/article/33/2/200/2404347 https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/94719/ http://fampra.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/2/200.abstract https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26921610/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26921610 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26921610,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmw003,26921610,10.1093/fampra/cmw003,2291789648,,0,000-970-252-625-70X; 001-458-852-567-500; 014-114-401-286-462; 014-613-821-590-600; 014-722-929-662-576; 017-473-802-229-083; 018-369-394-676-197; 022-920-072-197-333; 024-584-222-801-720; 025-172-707-508-798; 033-482-943-678-40X; 037-555-154-136-130; 051-125-535-243-359; 052-632-763-479-438; 063-270-330-160-599; 068-542-692-818-245; 081-939-746-589-107; 095-897-685-395-645; 101-054-056-295-190; 105-338-033-905-726; 108-434-308-347-401; 112-149-524-453-69X; 114-623-707-982-728; 117-969-497-208-642,8

A trend toward increased sharing of neuroimaging data has emerged in recent years. Nevertheless, a number of barriers continue to impede momentum. Many researchers and institutions remain uncertain about how to share data or lack the tools and expertise to participate in data sharing. The use of electronic data capture (EDC) methods for neuroimaging greatly simplifies the task of data collection and has the potential to help standardize many aspects of data sharing. We review here the motivations for sharing neuroimaging data, the current data sharing landscape, and the sociological or technical barriers that still need to be addressed. The INCF Task Force on Neuroimaging Datasharing, in conjunction with several collaborative groups around the world, has started work on several tools to ease and eventually automate the practice of data sharing. It is hoped that such tools will allow researchers to easily share raw, processed, and derived neuroimaging data, with appropriate metadata and provenance records, and will improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging studies. By providing seamless integration of data sharing and analysis tools within a commodity research environment, the Task Force seeks to identify and minimize barriers to data sharing in the field of neuroimaging.",6,9,9,9,Data collection; Cognitive neuroscience; Data science; Data sharing; Task (project management); Field (computer science); Computer science; Neuroimaging; Electronic data capture; Metadata,EEG-MEG; brain imaging; data sharing; fMRI; magnetic resonance imaging; standards,,,Wellcome Trust (091593) United Kingdom; NICHD NIH HHS (P30 HD004147) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (R01 MH083320) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/3319918/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3319918 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fini/fini6.html#PolineBGGHHHHKMPSAK12 https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1578&context=psych_pp https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2012.00009/pdf https://www.biomed-data.eu/article/data-sharing-neuroimaging-research https://escholarship.org/uc/item/01k5x5tg.pdf https://escholarship.umassmed.edu/psych_pp/579/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fninf.2012.00009/full https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/data-sharing-in-neuroimaging-research(f79bf93e-84fa-4797-a08a-51fb89e5833c)/export.html https://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319918/ https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2012.00009 https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/1/10345106/1/3319918.pdf http://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2012.00009 https://doaj.org/article/39c3fdc198094583ad0a7f2cbfc1ef00 https://core.ac.uk/display/46039536 https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10345106 https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/10345106/3319918.pdf?sequence=1 http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2012.00009 https://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/open_access_pubs/2261/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2012.00009/full http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1835600 https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2012.00009 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22493576 https://digitalcommons.wustl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3258&context=open_access_pubs https://escholarship.org/uc/item/01k5x5tg https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_1835600 https://escholarship.org/content/qt01k5x5tg/qt01k5x5tg.pdf?t=n4supy https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1344634 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22493576/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/8772914.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2012.00009,22493576,10.3389/fninf.2012.00009,2150469595,PMC3319918,0,000-199-206-963-760; 001-366-131-837-824; 008-649-577-094-126; 008-989-867-184-42X; 009-531-378-283-656; 012-470-423-216-287; 013-108-644-782-623; 013-549-812-638-473; 013-647-994-006-184; 013-677-285-412-574; 014-119-841-527-314; 015-858-891-845-535; 018-073-055-965-32X; 019-086-252-766-855; 019-538-368-158-59X; 020-495-567-807-044; 020-943-346-224-861; 021-913-443-924-092; 024-215-227-220-331; 024-240-694-091-801; 025-693-230-822-176; 028-009-410-309-922; 028-774-914-246-548; 029-088-971-763-740; 030-628-760-321-459; 033-764-591-171-255; 037-166-852-723-296; 039-127-458-511-704; 043-783-102-106-345; 045-813-634-810-189; 046-520-740-962-255; 046-964-815-745-624; 047-896-552-127-49X; 047-934-658-648-407; 053-119-843-648-851; 060-467-771-792-524; 060-747-563-467-504; 061-573-459-860-444; 062-044-867-830-730; 064-341-294-777-488; 066-325-244-590-650; 066-769-300-435-039; 069-055-013-587-210; 074-181-262-855-931; 076-318-356-126-075; 076-925-066-898-071; 081-113-789-539-58X; 081-358-184-678-953; 083-636-286-890-090; 095-248-106-456-264; 096-141-845-715-529; 098-530-546-145-767; 099-846-824-828-689; 104-401-676-337-42X; 107-745-843-116-13X; 115-887-728-358-540; 121-793-115-419-910; 127-846-078-226-101; 129-859-822-887-481; 135-498-631-057-051; 144-497-350-407-045; 163-406-205-633-057; 165-203-167-748-162; 175-149-542-005-60X; 188-270-297-190-317; 192-170-068-969-630,205

In this paper we describe the design, implementation, and deployment of an advertisement auditing system called eyeWnder that uses crowdsourcing to reveal in real time whether a display advertisement has been targeted or not. Crowdsourcing simplifies the detection of targeted advertising, but requires reporting to a central repository the impressions seen by different users, thereby jeopardizing their privacy. We break this deadlock with a privacy preserving data sharing protocol that allows eyeWnder to compute global statistics required to detect targeting, while keeping the advertisements seen by individual users and their browsing history private. We conduct a simulation study to explore the effect of different parameters and a live validation to demonstrate the accuracy of our approach. Unlike previous solutions, eyeWnder can even detect indirect targeting, i.e., marketing campaigns that promote a product or service whose description bears no semantic overlap with its targeted audience.",,,110,122,Distributed algorithm; Deadlock; Targeted advertising; Data sharing; Service (systems architecture); Computer security; Computer science; Crowdsourcing; Data Protection Act 1998; Protocol (object-oriented programming); Targeted advertising; Data sharing; Service (systems architecture); Computer security; Computer science; Crowdsourcing; Data Protection Act 1998; Protocol (object-oriented programming),,,,Marie Curie; Horizon 2020,https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_3237892 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01862.pdf https://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/abs/1907.01862 https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01862 https://dspace.networks.imdea.org/handle/20.500.12761/755 https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3359989.3365428 http://eprints.networks.imdea.org/2056/1/1907.01862.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1907.html#abs-1907-01862,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3359989.3365428,,10.1145/3359989.3365428,2992310400; 2953574061,,0,005-475-178-315-044; 010-106-902-040-019; 010-305-376-533-228; 012-015-720-949-044; 017-462-338-882-316; 023-184-650-506-657; 024-118-608-815-377; 024-718-219-801-333; 031-106-692-927-317; 031-184-492-893-064; 033-326-339-375-045; 036-421-730-918-932; 040-612-337-798-037; 040-772-575-143-311; 048-264-928-314-973; 052-439-411-996-103; 053-444-161-489-16X; 061-034-413-779-293; 072-271-825-423-734; 074-833-324-452-881; 080-788-677-884-505; 082-645-919-312-150; 083-559-809-325-845; 090-325-651-513-775; 093-384-693-582-209; 097-360-234-333-288; 105-614-775-483-858; 110-815-359-805-370; 112-079-602-846-755; 114-365-528-638-615; 115-137-673-085-211; 117-108-047-337-901; 117-254-946-017-149; 150-403-797-462-953; 153-584-217-067-653; 161-760-471-185-479; 163-598-540-594-808; 195-950-811-145-731; 198-058-103-518-746,8

Snow,"Summary Artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria has emerged in western Cambodia and has been detected in western Thailand. The situation is ominously reminiscent of the emergence of resistance to chloroquine and to sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine several decades ago. Artemisinin resistance is a major threat to global public health, with the most severe potential effects in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease burden is highest and systems for monitoring and containment of resistance are inadequate. The mechanisms that underlie artemisinin resistance are not fully understood. The main phenotypic trait associated with resistance is a substantial delay in parasite clearance, so far reported in southeast Asia but not in Africa. One of the pillars of the WHO global plan for artemisinin resistance containment is to increase monitoring and surveillance. In this Personal View, we propose strategies that should be adopted by malaria-endemic countries in Africa: resource mobilisation to reactivate regional surveillance networks, establishment of baseline parasite clearance profiles to serve as benchmarks to track emerging artemisinin resistance, improved data sharing to allow pooled analyses to identify rare events, modelling of risk factors for drug resistance, and development and validation of new approaches to monitor resistance.",12,11,888,896,Drug resistance; Public health; Biotechnology; Resource (biology); Chloroquine; Malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; Disease burden; Resistance (ecology); Biology; Environmental health,,"Africa/epidemiology; Africa South of the Sahara; Antimalarials/administration & dosage; Artemisinins/administration & dosage; Communicable Disease Control/methods; Drug Resistance; Humans; Malaria, Falciparum/drug therapy; Plasmodium falciparum/drug effects; Sentinel Surveillance; World Health Organization",Antimalarials; Artemisinins; artemisinin,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (079080) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (092654) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (092654/Z/10/A) United Kingdom,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3555126 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309912702414 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1473309912702414 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3555126/ https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(12)70241-4/fulltext http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(12)70241-4/fulltext https://www.academia.edu/62731508/Mitigating_the_threat_of_artemisinin_resistance_in_Africa_improvement_of_drug_resistance_surveillance_and_response_systems https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(12)70241-4.pdf https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1473309912702414/pdf http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23099083 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23099083/ https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/358303,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(12)70241-4,23099083,10.1016/s1473-3099(12)70241-4,2034986963,PMC3555126,0,000-314-690-451-257; 001-795-025-970-854; 003-217-609-524-645; 003-657-290-152-032; 003-803-398-557-042; 005-064-043-604-512; 005-115-194-445-595; 006-746-821-284-733; 007-895-786-580-371; 007-994-497-928-507; 008-518-627-390-24X; 009-158-705-317-030; 009-941-114-009-735; 013-484-936-420-498; 013-987-045-672-223; 016-393-351-771-458; 018-894-335-810-208; 019-540-602-925-914; 020-560-249-468-807; 022-007-855-193-873; 022-477-138-077-235; 022-869-869-153-433; 025-761-070-388-64X; 027-990-880-699-177; 028-602-324-480-843; 030-985-626-600-76X; 034-402-560-704-280; 034-472-280-775-942; 034-751-823-002-519; 034-869-661-739-30X; 036-725-258-714-444; 036-818-628-598-595; 037-841-171-893-456; 038-236-460-029-331; 039-283-122-752-39X; 040-532-407-134-923; 040-840-858-014-116; 041-491-096-163-708; 042-611-489-517-095; 042-793-843-490-500; 047-342-428-178-826; 050-102-583-572-853; 050-379-212-786-950; 051-510-012-177-39X; 052-013-317-505-859; 053-762-789-283-822; 054-298-888-014-505; 055-351-108-717-848; 055-968-948-253-767; 059-619-148-436-055; 060-178-452-502-760; 061-082-721-006-416; 066-264-138-170-066; 067-756-183-768-638; 067-791-463-940-950; 068-596-376-573-243; 069-231-356-123-426; 070-533-762-255-765; 070-709-947-967-394; 073-108-421-249-262; 074-566-706-764-262; 077-885-372-854-096; 079-521-077-147-976; 083-168-989-112-186; 084-730-023-752-195; 087-873-817-236-501; 089-913-154-823-495; 091-634-382-345-229; 095-752-048-981-126; 096-698-786-577-282; 096-956-218-590-162; 104-568-753-918-637; 105-721-755-893-802; 114-242-436-561-649; 115-529-832-185-379; 134-827-631-356-404; 144-673-672-047-556; 149-539-748-938-617; 178-298-774-507-420; 183-281-737-402-443,60

Whilst studies have so far analysed the content of RT's media reports, they have yet to interrogate how Russian legitimation claims are often expressed on RT through a blurring of news reporting and comedy. This paper addresses this gap and places humour at the centre of analysis, arguing that comedy and satire are fundamental to how RT claims legitimacy for Russian foreign policy. We begin by introducing theories of legitimation to studies of comedy in global politics, before then examining RT's social media outputs and audience responses to those. In doing so, we demonstrate that humour is central to how RT claims legitimacy for Russian foreign policy. From military intervention in Syria, to the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury, humour shapes how RT's legitimation claims are interpreted by their audiences.",35,2,269,288,Political science; Legitimation; Misinformation; Media studies; Legitimacy; Social media; Global politics; Comedy; Intervention (law); Foreign policy,,,,Arts and Humanities Research Council,http://oro.open.ac.uk/73646/ http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/227232/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13600826.2020.1839387,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13600826.2020.1839387,,10.1080/13600826.2020.1839387,3104121312,,0,003-586-755-682-450; 005-046-110-044-326; 007-384-822-467-874; 008-728-339-290-864; 011-398-104-824-656; 013-198-715-049-114; 013-773-261-197-400; 015-830-070-972-153; 020-690-836-376-478; 022-428-685-963-702; 024-337-867-894-524; 024-587-379-184-728; 027-368-583-036-027; 031-174-342-376-871; 033-798-183-533-849; 035-477-613-172-429; 036-660-663-541-458; 037-781-613-323-062; 041-905-098-378-902; 048-062-353-849-84X; 052-750-870-033-690; 053-525-388-816-393; 054-012-713-189-69X; 054-726-452-440-472; 056-590-285-940-607; 058-366-642-959-602; 060-979-141-310-26X; 063-560-022-404-470; 065-445-482-499-908; 070-458-725-955-343; 071-271-057-920-01X; 075-967-880-285-586; 079-249-034-215-414; 089-148-725-911-558; 089-852-934-211-047; 090-332-184-705-676; 091-733-941-721-678; 094-417-613-915-101; 094-978-274-651-411; 098-148-297-496-787; 098-749-002-519-763; 102-744-634-303-645; 109-391-961-968-170; 111-373-226-112-168; 120-432-583-165-544; 121-126-695-312-749; 127-050-680-392-299; 137-079-032-188-398; 140-727-158-760-637; 150-641-111-640-22X; 157-612-590-121-356; 159-993-087-304-15X,6

In addition to being an inappropriate and moralizing intrusion into the private lives of patients, it would put patients' sensitive data at risk, making data subjects vulnerable to a variety of privacy-related harms. Even though we allow privacy-invasive investigations to take place in legal trials, the justice and healthcare systems are not analogous. The duty of doctors and healthcare professionals is to help patients as best they can-not to judge them. Patients should not be forced into giving up any more personal information than what is strictly necessary to receive an adequate treatment, and their medical data should only be used for appropriate purposes. Medical ethics codes should reflect these data rights. When a doctor asks personal questions that are irrelevant to diagnose or treat a patient, the appropriate response from the patient is: 'none of your business'.",34,7,712,718,Internet privacy; Moral responsibility; Medical ethics; Variety (cybernetics); Psychology; Personally identifiable information; Justice (ethics); Duty; Egalitarianism; Confidentiality,confidentiality; data minimization; data rights; egalitarianism; luck; medical ethics codes; personal responsibility; privacy,"Codes of Ethics; Confidentiality/ethics; Ethics, Medical; Health Care Rationing/ethics; Health Risk Behaviors/ethics; Humans; Medical History Taking; Physician-Patient Relations/ethics; Privacy",,Wellcome Trust (104848) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT104848/Z/14/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (203132/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7587002 http://europepmc.org/article/MED/32060936 https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3712311&dgcid=ejournal_htmlemail_medicallegal:studies:ejournal_abstractlink https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bioe.12711 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3712311,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bioe.12711,32060936,10.1111/bioe.12711,3006429780,PMC7587002,0,002-600-507-580-465; 005-706-993-147-775; 008-924-328-929-528; 009-066-307-556-265; 020-004-644-447-945; 026-670-943-855-01X; 033-920-166-463-523; 047-367-702-283-698; 053-489-728-729-021; 064-852-801-879-513; 112-747-215-660-644,3

Kimani-Murage,"Although recent policies have sought to increase the rates of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and continued breastfeeding for HIV exposed infants, few programs have considered the multiple social and cultural barriers to the practice. Therefore, to generate evidence for exclusive and continued breastfeeding policies in Kenya, we examined community perspectives on the facilitators and barriers in adherence to EBF for the HIV positive mothers. Qualitative research was conducted in Koibatek, a sub-County in Baringo County Kenya, in August 2014 among 205 respondents. A total of 14 focus group discussions (n = 177), 14 In-depth Interviews and 16 key informant interviews were conducted. Transcribed data was analyzed thematically. NVivo version 10.0 computer qualitative software program was used to manage and facilitate the analysis. Facilitators to exclusive breastfeeding were perceived to include counselling at the health facility, desire to have a healthy baby, use of antiretroviral drugs and health benefits associated with breastmilk. Barriers to EBF included poor dissemination of policies, knowledge gap, misinterpretation of EBF, inadequate counselling, attitude of mother and health workers due to fear of vertical HIV transmission, stigma related to misconception and misinformation that EBF is only compulsory for HIV positive mothers, stigma related to HIV and disclosure, social pressure, lack of male involvement, cultural practices and traditions, employment, food insecurity. There are multiple facilitators and barriers of optimal breastfeeding that needs a holistic approach to interventions aimed at achieving elimination of mother to child transmission. Extension of infant feeding support in the context of HIV to the community while building on existing interventions such as the Baby Friendly Community Initiative is key to providing confidential support services for the additional needs faced by HIV positive mothers.",16,1,39,39,Stigma (botany); Qualitative research; Psychological intervention; Health facility; Breastfeeding; Misinformation; Context (language use); Family medicine; Focus group; Medicine,Barriers; Continued breastfeeding; Exclusive breastfeeding; Facilitators; HIV; Kenya; Policy,"Breast Feeding; Child; Female; HIV Infections/drug therapy; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infant; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical/prevention & control; Kenya; Male; Mothers; Policy; Qualitative Research",,Wellcome Trust ( 208791/Z/17/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (097146/Z/11/Z) United Kingdom,https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/realities-and-challenges-of-breastfeeding-policy-in-the-context-o https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33964950 https://internationalbreastfeedingjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13006-021-00385-1 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13006-021-00385-1.pdf https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/7366059 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13006-021-00385-1 https://scholar.sun.ac.za:443/handle/10019.1/110873 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33964950/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8106855,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13006-021-00385-1,33964950,10.1186/s13006-021-00385-1,3160295567,PMC8106855,0,001-187-747-299-610; 004-568-741-530-20X; 007-320-339-195-722; 010-391-783-969-348; 012-326-623-427-170; 013-305-820-328-693; 013-716-666-989-739; 014-922-033-387-520; 016-454-903-264-945; 017-269-144-377-288; 020-521-105-300-501; 021-029-421-659-235; 022-994-668-506-338; 025-363-682-756-294; 026-318-524-757-690; 026-973-175-287-66X; 030-025-815-815-059; 031-860-521-978-886; 033-244-398-887-332; 033-733-067-745-118; 033-864-928-393-901; 035-038-639-980-649; 037-706-340-928-401; 037-805-322-548-417; 038-200-774-350-14X; 038-760-542-776-788; 039-320-996-539-880; 045-377-360-687-882; 048-919-105-074-969; 053-857-513-616-106; 055-475-718-225-132; 056-814-185-982-164; 061-114-995-706-026; 064-174-214-235-094; 066-569-397-015-455; 069-863-825-266-282; 071-218-974-037-926; 072-119-330-683-968; 085-674-864-109-690; 088-762-849-855-803; 091-962-688-835-83X; 103-828-966-180-463; 111-918-877-332-217; 117-064-813-069-570; 118-063-587-432-248; 127-775-751-695-667; 140-839-259-253-147; 155-899-733-905-94X; 169-122-700-868-658,0

This study aimed to understand whether discrete emotional responses and perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes versus smoking mediate the effect of exposure to tweets about the harms of e-cigarettes on Twitter and intention to purchase e-cigarettes among adult smokers. We conducted a web-based experiment in November 2019 among 2400 adult smokers who were randomly assigned to view one of four conditions of tweets containing different levels of misinformation. We fitted mediation models using structural equation modeling and bootstrap procedures to assess the indirect effects of exposure to tweets through perceived relative harm of e-cigarettes and six discrete emotions. Our findings support that exposure to tweets about harms of e-cigarettes influence intention to purchase e-cigarettes through perceived relative harm, discrete emotional responses, and serially through emotional responses and perceived relative harm. Feeling worried, hopeful, and happy mediated the effects of condition on intention to purchase e-cigarettes. Feeling scared, worried, angry, and hopeful mediated the effects serially through perceived relative harm. Affective responses and perceived relative harm following exposure to misinformation about e-cigarette harm may mediate the relationship with intention to purchase e-cigarettes among adult smokers.",18,23,12347,,Feeling; Psychology; Misinformation; Harm; Discrete emotions; Social media; Mediation (statistics); Structural equation modeling; Social psychology,Twitter; e-cigarettes; emotions; misinformation; social media,Adult; Communication; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Emotions; Humans; Intention; Smokers; Social Media,,Cancer Research UK (C60153/A28664) United Kingdom; NIDA NIH HHS (K23 DA045766) United States; United States Food and Drug Administration (R03CA212544-01A1); NCI NIH HHS (R01CA246418) United States; NCI NIH HHS (1R01CA237670-01A1) United States; NIH HHS (2T32CA057711-27) United States,https://www.mdpi.com/1373464 https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/23/12347/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312347,34886071,10.3390/ijerph182312347,3215342933,PMC8656833,0,000-905-303-874-618; 007-945-428-818-653; 008-565-741-602-391; 020-060-966-209-102; 021-943-391-029-72X; 023-559-949-701-56X; 025-724-556-647-792; 027-861-615-427-196; 028-027-002-443-312; 032-071-942-212-517; 039-932-598-715-380; 048-209-347-320-054; 048-813-146-315-719; 052-511-651-840-54X; 067-613-683-335-144; 075-648-995-668-28X; 075-929-300-300-624; 078-597-023-654-352; 088-496-351-880-981; 099-927-039-017-201; 117-286-718-759-980; 126-584-985-547-01X; 148-878-799-327-998,0

A related initiative, the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), evolved from the General Practice Research Database (GPRD). CPRD was intended to build on GPRD by linking patients’ primary care records to hospital data, around 50 disease registries and clinical audits, genetic information from UK Biobank, and even the loyalty cards of a large supermarket chain, creating an integrated data repository and linked services for all of England that could be sold to universities, drug companies, and non-healthcare industries. Care.data has now been abandoned and CPRD has stalled. The flawed implementation of care.data plus earlier examples of data mismanagement have made privacy issues a mainstream public concern.

Design Living systematic review and critical appraisal by the COVID-PRECISE (Precise Risk Estimation to optimise covid-19 Care for Infected or Suspected patients in diverse sEttings) group. Data sources PubMed and Embase through Ovid, up to 1 July 2020, supplemented with arXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv up to 5 May 2020. Study selection Studies that developed or validated a multivariable covid-19 related prediction model. Data extraction At least two authors independently extracted data using the CHARMS (critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews of prediction modelling studies) checklist; risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST (prediction model risk of bias assessment tool). Results 37 421 titles were screened, and 169 studies describing 232 prediction models were included. The review identified seven models for identifying people at risk in the general population; 118 diagnostic models for detecting covid-19 (75 were based on medical imaging, 10 to diagnose disease severity); and 107 prognostic models for predicting mortality risk, progression to severe disease, intensive care unit admission, ventilation, intubation, or length of hospital stay. The most frequent types of predictors included in the covid-19 prediction models are vital signs, age, comorbidities, and image features. Flu-like symptoms are frequently predictive in diagnostic models, while sex, C reactive protein, and lymphocyte counts are frequent prognostic factors. Reported C index estimates from the strongest form of validation available per model ranged from 0.71 to 0.99 in prediction models for the general population, from 0.65 to more than 0.99 in diagnostic models, and from 0.54 to 0.99 in prognostic models. All models were rated at high or unclear risk of bias, mostly because of non-representative selection of control patients, exclusion of patients who had not experienced the event of interest by the end of the study, high risk of model overfitting, and unclear reporting. Many models did not include a description of the target population (n=27, 12%) or care setting (n=75, 32%), and only 11 (5%) were externally validated by a calibration plot. The Jehi diagnostic model and the 4C mortality score were identified as promising models. Conclusion Prediction models for covid-19 are quickly entering the academic literature to support medical decision making at a time when they are urgently needed. This review indicates that almost all pubished prediction models are poorly reported, and at high risk of bias such that their reported predictive performance is probably optimistic. However, we have identified two (one diagnostic and one prognostic) promising models that should soon be validated in multiple cohorts, preferably through collaborative efforts and data sharing to also allow an investigation of the stability and heterogeneity in their performance across populations and settings. Details on all reviewed models are publicly available at https://www.covprecise.org/. Methodological guidance as provided in this paper should be followed because unreliable predictions could cause more harm than benefit in guiding clinical decisions. Finally, prediction model authors should adhere to the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) reporting guideline.

Yet there is scope for interpretation within the legislation and associated guidance.; •Inherent tensions around intrusion, data gathering, professional roles, and balancing well-being against child protection threaten the effectiveness of the policy if not resolved.; ; ; Context; ; Despite persistent health inequalities and intergenerational deprivation, the Scottish government aspires for Scotland to be the best country for children to grow up in. Getting It Right for Every Child (GIRFEC) is a landmark children's policy framework to improve children's well-being via early intervention, universal service provision, and multiagency coordination across organizational boundaries. Placing the child and family “at the center,” this approach marks a shift from welfare to well-being, yet there is still a general lack of consensus over how well-being is defined and measured. As an umbrella policy framework with broad reach, GIRFEC represents the current and future direction of children's/family policy in Scotland, yet large-scale practice change is required for successful implementation.; ; ; Methods; ; This article explores the origins and emergence of GIRFEC and presents a critical analysis of its incremental design, development, and implementation.; ; ; Findings; ; There is considerable scope for interpretation within the GIRFEC legislation and guidance, most notably around assessment of well-being and the role and remit of those charged with implementation. Tensions have arisen around issues such as professional roles; intrusion, data sharing, and confidentiality; and the balance between supporting well-being and protecting children. Despite the policy's intentions for integration, the service landscape for children and families still remains relatively fragmented.; ; ; Conclusions; ; Although the policy has groundbreaking potential, inherent tensions must be resolved and the processes of change carefully managed in order for GIRFEC to be effective. It remains to be seen whether GIRFEC can fulfil the Scottish government's aspirations to reduce inequalities and improve lifelong outcomes for Scotland's children and young people. In terms of both a national children's well-being framework within a universal public service context and a distinct style of policymaking and implementation, the Scottish experience represents a unique case study of whole-country, transformational change and is of relevance to other jurisdictions.",94,2,334,365,Policy analysis; Government; Economics; Legislation; Child protection; Context (language use); Public service; Universal service; National Policy; Public administration; Public relations,children; early intervention; policy analysis; policy development; well-being,"Child; Child Health/economics; Child Welfare/economics; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated/economics; Health Plan Implementation/legislation & jurisprudence; Health Policy/economics; Humans; Information Dissemination/legislation & jurisprudence; National Health Programs/economics; Scotland; Social Justice; Socioeconomic Factors",,Chief Scientist Office (NMAHP1) United Kingdom,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0009.12195 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4911714 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.wiley-milq-v-94-i-2-milq12195 http://eresearch.qmu.ac.uk/4899/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27265560/ http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12195/pdf https://research-portal.uws.ac.uk/en/publications/getting-it-right-for-every-child-a-national-policy-framework-to-p https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911714/ https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/getting-it-right-for-every-child-a-national-policy-framework-to-promote-childrens-well-being-in-scotland-united-kingdom/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0009.12195/pdf https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/23296,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12195,27265560,10.1111/1468-0009.12195,2415576645,PMC4911714,0,000-637-036-944-272; 001-959-264-610-766; 007-787-850-112-188; 016-966-017-811-798; 023-287-740-263-97X; 023-656-967-170-701; 028-208-639-298-733; 028-897-782-256-794; 031-449-027-773-316; 032-318-160-195-136; 038-889-662-830-598; 052-497-602-674-954; 057-274-272-970-083; 062-864-789-045-246; 068-166-785-642-844; 076-929-758-518-373; 079-401-567-131-794; 079-583-791-837-601; 081-075-416-517-543; 083-302-151-087-946; 088-232-968-873-264; 088-493-943-327-57X; 089-953-573-670-194; 092-451-973-362-607; 092-649-421-183-460; 096-877-974-747-406; 104-153-499-595-515; 113-482-338-205-559; 116-320-529-397-730; 150-081-755-141-570; 159-802-255-882-174; 176-800-282-796-914; 191-205-877-989-616,18

Researchers are increasingly required to endorse adaptive and flexible approaches to accommodate these innovations and comply with ethical, legal and regulatory requirements. This paper explores how Dynamic Consent may provide solutions to address challenges encountered when researchers invite individuals to participate in research and follow them up over time in a continuously changing environment. Methods An interdisciplinary workshop jointly organised by the University of Oxford and the COST Action CHIP ME gathered clinicians, researchers, ethicists, lawyers, research participants and patient representatives to discuss experiences of using Dynamic Consent, and how such use may facilitate the conduct of specific research tasks. The data collected during the workshop were analysed using a content analysis approach. Results Dynamic Consent can provide practical, sustainable and future-proof solutions to challenges related to participant recruitment, the attainment of informed consent, participant retention and consent management, and may bring economic efficiencies. Conclusions Dynamic Consent offers opportunities for ongoing communication between researchers and research participants that can positively impact research. Dynamic Consent supports inter-sector, cross-border approaches and large scale data-sharing. Whilst it is relatively easy to set up and maintain, its implementation will require that researchers re-consider their relationship with research participants and adopt new procedures.",18,1,4,4,Biobank; Philosophy of medicine; Medical ethics; Research ethics; Content analysis; Research design; Information Dissemination; Engineering ethics; Informed consent; Medicine,Biobank; Clinical research; Clinical trials; Dynamic consent; Ethics; Participant engagement; Research communication; Software tools,"Biomedical Research/ethics; Communication; Data Collection/methods; Ethics, Research; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Information Dissemination; Informed Consent; Patient Selection; Professional-Patient Relations; Research Design; Research Personnel; Research Subjects",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (096599/2/11/Z) United Kingdom,https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/53643 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28122615 https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/publications/673247 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1540792/ https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5264333 https://www.unirepository.svkri.uniri.hr/islandora/object/medri%3A2306 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/673247 https://core.ac.uk/display/83936364 http://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9 https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9 https://philpapers.org/rec/BUDDCA https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28122615/ http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1540792/ https://0-bmcmedethics-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9 https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9.pdf http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1078021 https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/publications/673247 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/144830051.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9,28122615,10.1186/s12910-016-0162-9,2580761472,PMC5264333,0,001-610-630-749-994; 002-300-122-645-120; 002-378-823-460-356; 004-338-055-065-113; 004-613-862-207-388; 006-306-535-190-681; 007-406-314-592-593; 009-977-142-156-462; 011-327-854-618-992; 011-680-025-098-982; 013-438-358-393-549; 014-484-650-162-709; 014-520-741-653-496; 015-371-869-495-028; 016-282-408-493-072; 017-154-071-526-43X; 017-193-865-803-955; 017-332-092-657-286; 017-776-709-682-455; 018-608-379-084-949; 020-516-615-191-329; 021-445-243-251-642; 021-862-840-020-92X; 024-255-520-105-128; 028-847-382-290-242; 030-658-234-091-11X; 037-815-368-187-521; 039-507-873-188-515; 043-279-124-924-936; 043-517-053-250-92X; 043-786-976-783-463; 047-022-366-278-30X; 047-855-094-729-360; 048-247-108-072-011; 048-912-199-333-412; 051-885-200-969-600; 052-072-288-289-172; 057-076-473-403-408; 058-566-337-103-441; 059-559-586-141-001; 060-384-087-987-794; 060-669-508-843-991; 065-958-273-215-976; 073-949-167-991-686; 082-630-269-881-80X; 085-295-269-978-648; 085-315-690-352-951; 085-603-940-328-628; 089-411-742-396-602; 090-001-233-527-428; 091-216-763-611-605; 107-987-101-148-767; 120-131-933-505-029; 120-933-590-406-882; 122-059-015-538-234; 123-219-259-676-525; 125-810-717-283-966; 152-458-993-180-997; 167-632-970-536-001; 171-592-900-274-916; 176-924-715-754-731,127

Saving lives and slowing the worldwide pandemic remain of utmost importance to everyone: the public, healthcare professionals, scientists, industry and governments.; ; It is absolutely essential that advice given to the public is evidence-based, accurate and timely; anything less would mislead and has the potential to cause harm. Popular information channels, such as social media platforms, have been rife with misinformation that has been perpetuated by fear and uncertainty. This has been the case particularly for diet and lifestyle advice. There are recommendations for the prevention of the spread of COVID-19 from the WHO,1 the UK,2 Irish3 and USA4 governments and the European Commission,5 as well as public health and healthcare agencies, including key direction on self-isolation.6 ; ; This short original report aims to provide a balanced scientific view on vitamin D and SARS-CoV-2 virus/COVID-19 disease. It provides a succinct summary of the current scientific evidence of associations between vitamin D, influenza, upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and immune health. Importantly, the paper concludes with lifestyle strategies for avoiding vitamin D deficiency and ensuring a healthy balanced diet at any time, including during the current pandemic. The overarching messages are as follows: (1) Vitamin D is essential for good health. (2) Many people, particularly those living in northern latitudes (such as the UK, Ireland, Northern Europe, Canada and the northern parts of the USA, northern India and China), have poor vitamin D status, especially in winter or if confined indoors. (3) Low vitamin D status may be exacerbated during this COVID-19 crisis (eg, due to indoor living and hence reduced sun exposure), and anyone who is self-isolating with limited access to sunlight is advised to take a vitamin D …",3,1,106,110,Scientific evidence; Vitamin D and neurology; Public health; Health care; Political science; Misinformation; Disease; vitamin D deficiency; Pandemic; Environmental health,musculo-skeletal health; nutrient deficiencies; nutritional treatment,,,Medical Research Council (MR/K00414X/1) United Kingdom,https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/publications/vitamin-d-and-sars-co-v-2-viruscovid-19-disease https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/266225 https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/266225 http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000089 http://nutrition.bmj.com/content/3/1/106 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33230499/ https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/vitamin-d-and-sars-cov-2-viruscovid-19-disease https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/75442/ https://ulster-staging.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/vitamin-d-and-sars-cov-2-viruscovid-19-disease https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7246103/ https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/vitamin-d-and-sarscov2-viruscovid19-disease(4b25ac8a-5e9b-4cc1-912d-adc32a9145f7).html https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/files/95538670/bmjnph_2020_000089.full.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33230499 https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/bmjnph/early/2020/05/15/bmjnph-2020-000089.full.pdf https://research.brighton.ac.uk/en/publications/vitamin-d-and-sars-cov-2-viruscovid-19-disease https://cris.brighton.ac.uk/ws/files/13785403/Vitamin_D_and_SARS_CoV_2_virus_COVID_19_disease_bmjnph_2020_000089.full.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000089 https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/vitamin-d-and-sarscov2-viruscovid19-disease(0d3416fc-2f78-4694-8c66-1c3532a3f9ab).html https://nutrition.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/15/bmjnph-2020-000089 https://core.ac.uk/download/323989302.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000089,33230499,10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000089,3025366776,PMC7246103,0,000-353-245-514-370; 000-513-537-057-933; 001-549-733-787-766; 002-217-860-836-490; 005-725-900-913-498; 006-208-390-858-513; 006-595-750-285-150; 010-575-568-757-576; 011-774-647-517-130; 012-355-832-922-648; 013-084-312-649-283; 013-103-037-581-624; 018-212-481-753-984; 021-689-395-555-486; 024-532-433-555-529; 026-490-066-127-898; 026-562-682-782-431; 028-478-941-164-592; 031-215-119-160-080; 031-407-943-358-278; 040-732-258-607-243; 043-332-246-846-761; 043-958-172-466-436; 049-513-126-987-077; 050-361-038-148-500; 054-043-391-400-932; 057-596-409-821-137; 066-054-578-910-480; 067-812-490-612-944; 069-124-702-888-947; 072-260-223-049-243; 074-087-143-347-036; 074-855-196-566-127; 082-756-220-726-888; 090-840-411-764-811; 091-546-026-810-227; 094-469-273-109-22X; 101-001-486-220-026; 108-747-564-809-422; 111-349-366-067-012; 124-360-296-883-725; 148-812-033-324-927,80

Abnet; Paul Brennan; Paul D.P. Pharoah; Sanford M. Dawsey; Reza Malekzadeh,"Background: Only a limited number of studies have investigated the correlation between haematocrit (HCT) and mortality in the general population, and few of those studies have had data on a wide range of low and high levels of HCT. We investigated the association between baseline HCT and mortality in a prospective cohort study of 49 983 adult subjects in Iran with a broad spectrum of HCT values. Methods: Data on socio-demographic and life-style factors, past medical history, and levels of HCT were collected at enrollment. During a mean follow-up of 5 years (follow-up success rate Â±99%), 2262 deaths were reported. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Results: There was a U-shaped relationship between categories of HCT and mortality in both sexes: both low and high levels of HCT were associated with increased overall mortality and mortality from cardiovascular disease. The U-shaped relationship persisted after several sensitivity analyses were done, including analyses restricted to non-smokers and non-users of opium; analyses excluding deaths from accidents and other external causes as well as deaths of persons with self-reported ischemic heart disease at the baseline interview for the study; and analyses excluding the first 2 years of follow-up. Self-reported past medical history and lack of data about lipids and other cellular blood components were the major limitations of the study. Conclusions: Low and high levels of HCT are associated with increased mortality in the general population. The findings in the present study can be of particular importance for low- and middle-income countries in which a substantial proportion of the population lives with suboptimal levels of HCT.

We aimed to produce an ethical framework to identify the range of ethical considerations relevant to HEI testing programmes and to support organisational decision-making. Methods: We conducted a mixed-method consultation (survey and semi-structured interviews) with students and staff at a case study university that was running a student testing programme. Survey data were analysed descriptively; data analysis for interviews was based on the Framework method. The findings of the consultation were combined with literature review, legal/ethical analysis and expert views to produce an ethical framework. Results: A total of 239 people took part in the consultation: 213 completed surveys (189 students, 24 staff) and 26 (16 students, 7 staff) participated in interviews. The survey identified clear support (99% of survey respondents) for the testing programme. Around two-thirds (62%) supported non-mandatory participation. Over half (54%) felt that the programme would need to be at least moderately effective to be acceptable. Over three-quarters (76%) felt the university had some responsibility to run a testing programme. Synthesis of consultation findings and further analysis identified nine areas of ethical consideration for HEIs looking to implement mass asymptomatic testing programmes: design and operation; goals; properties of the test; enabling isolation; choices about participation; benefits, harms and opportunity costs; responsibilities between students and institutions; privacy, confidentiality and data-sharing; and communication. The ethical framework includes recommendations in each of these areas, with illustrative examples of how they might be put into practice. Conclusions: By identifying ethical considerations relevant to university student testing programmes using analysis and consultation, the framework we developed has potential to facilitate deliberation about ethical aspects of such programmes, as well as informing decision-making about their introduction, design and delivery.",6,,101,,Higher education; Public health; Psychology; Bioethics; Survey data collection; Deliberation; Test (assessment); Medical education; Opportunity cost; Confidentiality,,,,National Institute for Health Research; The Health Foundation; Wellcome Trust,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-101/v1/xml https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-101 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-101/v1/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16807.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16807.1,3160034201,,0,002-682-203-214-302; 003-301-889-454-849; 004-103-410-853-178; 004-210-689-597-602; 005-900-547-917-88X; 005-928-607-446-640; 006-588-631-616-492; 006-783-751-063-638; 010-511-388-085-44X; 012-102-984-228-625; 013-126-702-706-530; 014-403-656-010-784; 014-789-250-474-110; 014-873-132-374-241; 014-885-109-200-022; 019-632-965-300-68X; 021-464-423-611-143; 021-586-528-150-545; 024-479-408-743-376; 024-866-936-129-29X; 027-380-727-847-171; 029-760-860-975-655; 031-409-478-949-767; 032-018-353-535-518; 032-583-605-800-544; 034-424-409-372-620; 034-870-373-652-953; 039-095-458-133-738; 040-789-250-447-174; 042-374-304-814-688; 043-025-031-491-908; 043-820-253-366-291; 043-846-380-193-907; 044-993-921-583-542; 045-656-289-066-03X; 051-497-904-188-920; 052-094-049-882-136; 062-010-792-300-739; 065-402-936-519-417; 065-687-270-436-966; 071-791-879-737-010; 073-777-328-065-088; 074-475-858-141-44X; 074-727-839-823-654; 076-371-109-719-765; 076-468-773-024-962; 076-919-800-191-898; 082-440-186-839-000; 084-887-787-636-106; 087-520-627-447-187; 090-331-419-749-290; 092-221-937-574-692; 092-978-655-053-99X; 094-569-445-917-994; 099-003-643-206-623; 100-200-241-778-668; 102-448-693-764-525; 109-333-268-485-810; 113-007-892-302-580; 114-311-420-079-539; 132-931-067-538-270; 134-161-463-688-38X; 159-020-791-979-598; 170-199-601-610-062; 182-472-555-769-901,1

The combination of a public health emergency, economic distress, and misinformation-driven panic have pushed customers and vendors towards the shadow economy. In particular, dark web marketplaces (DWMs), commercial websites accessible via free software, have gained significant popularity. Here, we analyse 851,199 listings extracted from 30 DWMs between January 1, 2020 and November 16, 2020. We identify 788 listings directly related to COVID-19 products and monitor the temporal evolution of product categories including Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), medicines (e.g., hydroxyclorochine), and medical frauds.

These disorders are influenced by multiple risk factors, from genes to psychological vulnerabilities and environmental stressors, but research is hampered by a lack of sufficiently large comprehensive studies. We are recruiting 40,000 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety and broad assessment of risks to facilitate future research. Methods The Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study ( www.gladstudy.org.uk ) recruits individuals with depression or anxiety into the NIHR Mental Health BioResource. Participants invited to join the study (via media campaigns) provide demographic, environmental and genetic data, and consent for medical record linkage and recontact. Results Online recruitment was effective; 42,531 participants consented and 27,776 completed the questionnaire by end of July 2019. Participants’ questionnaire data identified very high rates of recurrent depression, severe anxiety, and comorbidity. Participants reported high rates of treatment receipt. The age profile of the sample is biased toward young adults, with higher recruitment of females and the more educated, especially at younger ages. Discussion This paper describes the study methodology and descriptive data for GLAD, which represents a large, recontactable resource that will enable future research into risks, outcomes, and treatment for anxiety and depression.",123,103503,103503,,Stressor; Mental health; Psychology; Medical record; Young adult; Depression (differential diagnoses); Comorbidity; Behavioural genetics; Anxiety; Clinical psychology,Anxiety; Behavior genetics; Data sharing; Depression; Life events; Psychiatric genetics,"Adolescent; Adult; Age of Onset; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety/genetics; Depression/genetics; Female; Genotype; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Selection; Phenotype; Phobic Disorders/genetics; Program Development/methods; Young Adult",,Medical Research Council (MR/M021475/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_PC_17217) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G108/603) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_PC_17209) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L010305/1) United Kingdom,https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/ws/files/77604024/GLAD_Study_publication_October_2019.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796719301895 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6891252 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/201913/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31715324/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796719301895 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31715324 https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/the-genetic-links-to-anxiety-and-depression-glad-study-online-rec,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2019.103503,31715324,10.1016/j.brat.2019.103503,2968610663,PMC6891252,0,001-527-110-932-843; 001-783-525-966-722; 003-384-487-170-25X; 003-503-249-557-597; 004-958-922-746-150; 006-132-026-287-736; 007-498-542-656-65X; 009-183-830-244-365; 012-261-590-520-533; 015-577-304-311-985; 015-637-299-917-545; 016-226-654-160-680; 017-065-351-141-644; 017-268-217-867-911; 018-033-921-461-464; 018-706-972-503-98X; 018-907-837-120-91X; 019-280-648-045-199; 019-490-041-408-278; 021-011-790-832-325; 022-593-603-103-653; 023-548-781-288-762; 027-754-055-467-400; 028-926-068-494-365; 029-430-385-741-435; 029-533-430-529-735; 030-524-469-140-605; 031-176-677-393-488; 036-498-323-924-695; 036-732-816-411-663; 038-651-085-350-008; 040-196-545-283-943; 042-105-535-042-747; 043-965-713-032-055; 044-203-963-336-698; 044-484-273-967-701; 044-717-016-042-489; 045-560-742-355-58X; 045-827-785-241-371; 046-254-442-110-813; 046-272-159-702-345; 049-779-787-172-64X; 051-593-605-673-299; 053-728-624-469-179; 055-525-697-017-854; 055-678-068-242-618; 064-613-873-610-064; 068-552-603-953-250; 073-295-901-303-447; 080-300-584-315-002; 080-321-082-026-692; 080-648-042-478-736; 082-894-003-990-119; 083-836-154-920-274; 087-558-480-413-532; 087-878-839-690-994; 087-941-743-817-056; 089-255-911-145-520; 090-218-486-623-511; 093-126-482-671-955; 097-137-722-570-539; 124-141-191-111-745; 124-335-206-510-905; 129-582-605-364-503; 140-211-012-948-744; 143-097-560-808-067; 150-325-162-873-23X; 153-144-186-932-712; 179-411-648-804-473; 181-618-158-394-432,19

Whether in such situations leaders can be replaced in their roles by better-informed group mates represents an important question in understanding the adaptive consequences of collective decision-making. Here, we use a clock-shifting procedure to predictably manipulate the directional error in navigational information possessed by established leaders within hierarchically structured flocks of homing pigeons ( Columba livia ). We demonstrate that in the majority of cases when leaders hold inaccurate information they lose their influence over the flock. In these cases, inaccurate information is filtered out through the rearrangement of hierarchical positions, preventing errors by former leaders from propagating down the hierarchy. Our study demonstrates that flexible decision-making structures can be valuable in situations where ‘bad’ information is introduced by otherwise influential individuals.",12,9,20160544,,Flock; Homing pigeon; Animal groups; Clock shift; Hierarchy; Social psychology; Biological clock; Biology,clock-shift; hierarchy; homing pigeon; leadership,"Animals; Biological Clocks; Columbidae/physiology; Decision Making; Flight, Animal/physiology; Homing Behavior/physiology; Leadership; Light; Social Dominance; Spatial Navigation/physiology",,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/H01103X/1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5046934 https://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/9/20160544 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/645887 http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/9/20160544 https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/37775 https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0544 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5046934 https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2491771 https://core.ac.uk/display/132831984 https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0544,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0544,27624797,10.1098/rsbl.2016.0544,2519501255,PMC5046934,0,008-854-093-245-963; 010-871-395-755-834; 012-084-664-003-308; 015-086-743-787-487; 018-649-728-463-690; 036-663-676-646-906; 044-675-844-814-891; 055-927-443-587-824; 073-499-778-180-852; 075-934-781-843-000; 079-726-308-872-649; 090-637-810-291-94X; 093-112-839-869-191; 096-189-030-966-418; 113-266-523-862-925; 134-125-313-204-548; 136-041-562-378-770; 139-780-752-053-174; 151-285-546-295-646; 154-843-258-990-364,11

We developed systematic approaches to (1) monitoring patients’ symptoms including depression using a ‘Symptom Monitoring Service’ and (2) providing treatment for those with major depression using a programme called ‘Depression Care for People with Cancer’. Used together, these two programmes were found to be highly effective and cost-effective in clinical trials. The overall aims of this project are to: (1) study the process of introducing these programmes into routine clinical care in a large cancer service, (2) identify the challenges associated with implementation and how these are overcome, (3) determine their effectiveness in a routine non-research setting and (4) describe patients’ and clinicians’ experience of the programmes. Methods and analysis This is a mixed-methods longitudinal implementation study. We will study the process of implementation in three phases (April 2016–December 2018): ‘Pre-implementation’ (setting up of the new programmes), ‘Early Implementation’ (implementation of the programmes in a small number of clinics) and ‘Implementation and Maintenance’ (implementation in the majority of clinics). We will use the following methods of data collection: (1) contemporaneous logs of the implementation process, (2) interviews with healthcare professionals and managers, (3) interviews with patients and (4) routinely collected clinical data. Ethics and dissemination The study has been reviewed by a joint committee of Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust Research and Development Department and the University of Oxford’s Clinical Trials and Research Governance Department and judged to be service evaluation, not requiring ethics committee approval. The findings of this study will guide the scaling up implementation of the programmes across the UK and will enable us to construct an implementation toolkit. We will disseminate our findings in publications and at relevant national and international conferences.",7,6,e016186,,Data collection; Nursing; Construct (philosophy); Alternative medicine; Depression (differential diagnoses); Service (business); Protocol (science); Corporate governance; Clinical trial; Medicine,RE-AIM; cancer care; depression; implementation processes; mixed-methods; symptoms,Attitude of Health Personnel; Cancer Care Facilities; Depression/diagnosis; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Longitudinal Studies; Medical Records; Neoplasms/psychology; Patient Satisfaction; Program Development; Research Design; Symptom Assessment,,"National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care, Oxford",https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/publications/698721 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28674143 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e016186 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/698721 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/257408 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e016186.altmetrics https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4034530/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5734371 https://core.ac.uk/display/96761261 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e016186.full.pdf https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/6/e016186.full.pdf https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/411615/ https://core.ac.uk/download/84150000.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016186,28674143,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016186,2724307411,PMC5734371,0,001-129-676-592-960; 002-821-246-365-554; 005-937-847-079-83X; 006-704-608-214-677; 007-290-430-272-309; 013-705-716-765-183; 036-146-207-295-810; 036-377-365-344-823; 037-550-015-414-716; 038-684-077-843-25X; 039-308-434-149-512; 045-772-105-224-768; 045-903-245-986-921; 048-144-774-715-283; 054-490-037-348-056; 055-051-678-218-659; 055-691-675-339-549; 058-655-578-615-645; 059-400-631-308-663; 062-323-106-869-771; 071-207-243-927-980; 081-187-705-722-259; 086-206-400-643-173; 101-896-238-509-04X; 112-010-824-028-832; 131-423-542-523-282; 179-958-557-537-778; 180-841-595-207-16X,1

Nichols,"A wealth of analysis tools are available to fMRI researchers in order to extract patterns of task variation and, ultimately, understand cognitive function. However, this 'methodological plurality' comes with a drawback. While conceptually similar, two different analysis pipelines applied on the same dataset may not produce the same scientific results. Differences in methods, implementations across software packages, and even operating systems or software versions all contribute to this variability. Consequently, attention in the field has recently been directed to reproducibility and data sharing. Neuroimaging is currently experiencing a surge in initiatives to improve research practices and ensure that all conclusions inferred from an fMRI study are replicable. In this work, our goal is to understand how choice of software package impacts on analysis results. We use publically shared data from three published task fMRI neuroimaging studies, reanalyzing each study using the three main neuroimaging software packages, AFNI, FSL and SPM, using parametric and nonparametric inference. We obtain all information on how to process, analyze, and model each dataset from the publications. We make quantitative and qualitative comparisons between our replications to gauge the scale of variability in our results and assess the fundamental differences between each software package. While qualitatively we find broad similarities between packages, we also discover marked differences, such as Dice similarity coefficients ranging from 0.000-0.743 in comparisons of thresholded statistic maps between software. We discuss the challenges involved in trying to reanalyse the published studies, and highlight our own efforts to make this research reproducible.",40,11,3362,3384,Software versioning; Data science; Implementation; Similarity (psychology); Software; Data sharing; Task (project management); Field (computer science); Computer science; Process (engineering),AFNI; FSL; SPM; analytic flexibility; analytic variability; fMRI; reproducibility; software comparison; task-fMRI,"Brain Mapping/methods; Functional Neuroimaging/methods; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Reproducibility of Results; Software",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/118753/ https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/995826 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/hbm.24603 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31050106 https://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-01760535v2 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31050106 https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/publications/995826 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6618324 https://osf.io/U2Q4Y/ https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/995826 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hbm.24603,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hbm.24603,31050106,10.1002/hbm.24603,2950480787,PMC6618324,0,000-125-181-498-310; 001-833-048-120-339; 001-880-624-371-075; 002-796-015-264-48X; 004-717-845-320-414; 004-866-135-660-624; 007-490-510-970-007; 010-149-885-519-449; 011-128-800-132-493; 011-543-929-020-220; 012-687-708-953-296; 012-707-655-269-508; 016-257-297-615-457; 017-113-368-940-606; 017-384-692-349-599; 019-104-192-746-639; 023-459-652-549-183; 025-156-289-323-474; 025-507-377-576-967; 029-029-002-740-224; 041-664-053-286-575; 043-326-852-258-416; 049-898-881-273-510; 050-671-715-707-490; 052-651-447-836-011; 053-544-962-207-159; 053-693-591-617-675; 055-440-153-775-021; 056-182-250-781-631; 056-856-443-498-531; 074-268-612-022-094; 082-325-971-692-282; 082-988-923-918-969; 083-189-490-045-773; 088-883-157-478-243; 094-224-811-628-487; 094-404-005-408-154; 095-276-761-910-687; 096-968-300-180-355; 099-202-498-558-180; 117-856-566-119-133; 119-572-790-495-473; 120-990-900-682-649; 123-958-152-397-939; 126-788-096-219-651; 127-375-785-505-363; 132-722-404-698-347; 161-367-926-807-027; 163-907-952-856-372; 178-348-684-531-382,60

The paper relies on an extensive review of empirical literature published in English after 2009, as well as an analysis of unpublished market research data from member companies of Vaccines Europe. Our synthesis suggests that hesitant attitudes to vaccination are prevalent and may be increasing since the influenza pandemic of 2009. We define hesitancy as an expression of concern or doubt about the value or safety of vaccination. This means that hesitant attitudes are not confined only to those who refuse vaccination or those who encourage others to refuse vaccination. For many people, vaccination attitudes are shaped not just by healthcare professionals but also by an array of other information sources, including online and social media sources. We find that healthcare professionals report increasing challenges to building a trustful relationship with patients, through which they might otherwise allay concerns and reassure hesitant patients. We also find a range of reasons for vaccination attitudes, only some of which can be characterised as being related to lack of awareness or misinformation. Reasons that relate to issues of mistrust are cited more commonly in the literature than reasons that relate to information deficit. The importance of trust in the institutions involved with vaccination is discussed in terms of implications for researchers and policy-makers; we suggest that rebuilding this trust is a multi-stakeholder problem requiring a co-ordinated strategy.",112,,1,11,Public health; Vaccination; Market research; Value (ethics); Misinformation; Patient safety; Impact factor; Public relations; Social media; Medicine,Attitude; Choice; Europe; Hesitancy; Immunisation; Perception; Public health; Vaccination,Attitude of Health Personnel; Attitude to Health; Europe; Humans; Vaccination/psychology,,Vaccines Europe; Sanofi Pasteur; UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR),https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:socmed:v:112:y:2014:i:c:p:1-11 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24788111 http://www.vaccineseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Attitudes_to_Vaccination_Critical_Review.pdf http://srodev.sussex.ac.uk/48423/ https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/759320-attitudes-to-vaccination--a-critical-review https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24788111 https://www.rand.org/pubs/external_publications/EP51662.html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24788111/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614002421 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v112y2014icp1-11.html http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/48423/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614002421,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.04.018,24788111,10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.04.018,2031092644,,0,000-559-763-579-549; 001-172-963-830-267; 003-420-921-771-943; 005-270-728-237-812; 008-288-330-303-108; 008-887-565-181-04X; 009-452-360-116-459; 009-753-144-525-273; 011-325-140-152-554; 012-231-491-362-595; 012-947-655-291-222; 014-602-513-243-224; 017-181-973-842-670; 018-483-442-068-700; 018-661-085-789-188; 020-551-010-405-21X; 021-206-798-394-390; 022-972-801-267-704; 030-914-792-247-115; 030-980-229-168-894; 031-541-842-041-623; 031-626-579-937-280; 034-301-200-739-014; 038-311-501-868-21X; 039-689-815-155-117; 041-415-268-745-989; 043-147-637-987-110; 044-356-496-635-417; 045-253-099-628-381; 047-430-299-215-749; 049-727-265-762-947; 051-418-327-718-814; 051-923-627-557-255; 057-543-047-554-772; 060-267-199-592-444; 062-106-193-551-778; 064-704-015-551-022; 066-316-823-226-496; 070-403-878-106-029; 072-669-655-453-972; 073-877-048-894-349; 075-395-738-751-792; 082-465-081-488-786; 083-096-420-332-993; 084-109-436-617-973; 084-516-067-842-056; 088-205-195-616-675; 092-707-049-421-751; 098-386-853-420-833; 100-452-585-142-111; 112-272-351-366-830; 124-244-808-096-648; 125-267-566-324-385; 126-922-681-963-347; 138-450-490-035-583; 145-674-677-572-14X; 154-615-484-589-590,445

Saunders,"Transcriptomics is being increasingly applied to generate new insight into the interactions between plants and their pathogens. For the wheat yellow (stripe) rust pathogen (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) RNA-based sequencing (RNA-Seq) has proved particularly valuable, overcoming the barriers associated with its obligate biotrophic nature. This includes the application of RNA-Seq approaches to study Pst and wheat gene expression dynamics over time and the Pst population composition through the use of a novel RNA-Seq based surveillance approach called “field pathogenomics”. As a dual RNA-Seq approach, the field pathogenomics technique also provides gene expression data from the host, giving new insight into host responses. However, this has created a wealth of data for interrogation. Here, we used the field pathogenomics approach to generate 538 new RNA-Seq datasets from Pst-infected field wheat samples, doubling the amount of transcriptomics data available for this important pathosystem. We then analysed these datasets alongside 66 RNA-Seq datasets from four Pst infection time-courses and 420 Pst-infected plant field and laboratory samples that were publicly available. A database of gene expression values for Pst and wheat was generated for each of these 1024 RNA-Seq datasets and incorporated into the development of the rust expression browser (;  http://www.rust-expression.com;  ). This enables for the first time simultaneous ‘point-and-click’ access to gene expression profiles for Pst and its wheat host and represents the largest database of processed RNA-Seq datasets available for any of the three Puccinia wheat rust pathogens. We also demonstrated the utility of the browser through investigation of expression of putative Pst virulence genes over time and examined the host plants response to Pst infection. The rust expression browser offers immense value to the wider community, facilitating data sharing and transparency and the underlying database can be continually expanded as more datasets become publicly available.",22,1,166,166,Gene; RNA-Seq; Pathogenomics; Pathosystem; Puccinia; Population; Virulence; Database; Biology; DNA microarray,Gene expression browser; Open science; Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici; RNA-Seq; Transcriptomics; Wheat yellow rust; expVIP,Basidiomycota/genetics; Plant Diseases/genetics; Transcriptome; Triticum/genetics; Virulence,,H2020 European Research Council (773311); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/M025519/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/P016855/1 and BB/P012574/1) United Kingdom; European Research Council () (715638),https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-021-07488-3 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12864-021-07488-3 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33750297/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7941908 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33750297 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12864-021-07488-3.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7941908 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33750297,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07488-3,33750297,10.1186/s12864-021-07488-3,3138973830,PMC7941908,0,005-665-940-090-068; 006-608-920-530-439; 007-891-715-094-626; 014-613-183-051-783; 017-694-490-190-675; 019-351-179-080-973; 020-578-519-546-963; 023-858-842-559-09X; 024-342-262-264-745; 025-283-296-990-55X; 028-677-139-836-170; 030-271-589-930-406; 030-498-472-704-639; 036-078-266-644-046; 038-295-823-945-110; 040-400-155-736-105; 040-427-765-158-832; 045-792-268-916-02X; 046-896-529-347-631; 047-500-657-807-674; 048-327-213-075-740; 055-321-836-931-204; 056-201-471-905-934; 062-624-828-612-969; 064-544-370-915-257; 067-128-409-923-606; 085-223-511-987-209; 086-954-957-877-798; 089-898-508-820-193; 097-379-113-347-763; 101-515-267-179-121; 124-205-605-259-863; 127-186-455-998-190; 134-290-460-892-60X; 142-198-435-631-350; 147-996-707-681-916; 150-325-162-873-23X; 162-413-681-307-315; 162-670-042-449-314; 164-113-824-450-142,3

After a public outcry, the scheme was postponed and cancelled. Public views of care.data have previously been analysed; this study aimed to understand contemporary general practitioners’ (GPs) views of the scheme, which may have been influential in its downfall. Design Systematic search of media articles, followed by media content analysis. Setting UK-based mainstream and GP-facing media in 2013 and 2014. Participants Articles were eligible if they focused on care.data, and GPs were quoted, authored the article, or if articles were written for a majority GP audience. Interventions N/A. Primary and secondary outcome measures Themes which explained GPs9 reactions to care.data and which could explain support for or opposition to the scheme. Results 162 media articles met inclusion criteria and were drawn from newspapers, news websites and GP-facing websites. GPs recognised care.data’s potential value for research and improving care, but had grave concerns about the scheme’s implementation. These centred the lack of safeguards and purpose around the scheme which meant patients were not able to make informed decisions about opt-out. GPs perceived they were poorly resourced to meet competing demands to both share patients’ data and protect confidentiality. They distrusted the government’s likely uses of the data and perceived a risk of patient reidentification if the data were sold onto commercial entities. Conclusions Findings show specific concerns which GPs had about care.data which led to the withdrawal of support. Future NHS patient data-sharing schemes should engage with GPs and other clinicians as key stakeholders from the earliest moments of planning, so that their views and needs are incorporated into the design of such schemes.",10,9,e038006,,Medical ethics; Public health; Health informatics; Newspaper; Psychological intervention; Mainstream; Data sharing; Public relations; Confidentiality; Medicine,epidemiology; health informatics; medical ethics; primary care; public health,Attitude of Health Personnel; England; General Practice; General Practitioners; Humans; Qualitative Research; State Medicine,,Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12017/13) United Kingdom; Chief Scientist Office (SPHSU13) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12017/15) United Kingdom; Chief Scientist Office (SPHSU15) United Kingdom; Chief Scientist Office (SCAF/15/02) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_00022/2) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (102215/2/13/2) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_PC_17210) United Kingdom,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/9/e038006 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32912990 http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/92812/ https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7485233 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/10/9/e038006.full.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/327950833.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038006,32912990,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038006,3084200684,PMC7485233,0,001-284-615-036-186; 013-541-969-076-695; 020-524-104-037-16X; 020-959-033-451-277; 029-669-403-413-991; 030-065-697-283-069; 035-774-688-423-799; 037-550-015-414-716; 038-733-948-530-143; 044-350-079-774-312; 057-815-748-257-742; 069-603-840-570-898; 083-275-795-865-394; 085-320-250-288-390; 132-413-131-092-075; 150-059-032-112-310; 162-725-859-796-180; 170-016-370-362-617; 184-193-219-560-392,2

Ménard; Richard Essery; Alan Barr; Paul Bartlett; Jeff Derry; Marie Dumont; Charles Fierz; Hyungjun Kim; Anna Kontu; Yves Lejeune; Danny Marks; Masashi Niwano; Mark Raleigh; Libo Wang; Nander Wever,"<jats:p>Abstract. This paper describes in situ meteorological forcing and evaluation data, and bias-corrected reanalysis forcing data, for cold regions modelling at ten sites. The long-term datasets (one maritime, one arctic, three boreal and five mid-latitude alpine) are the reference sites chosen for evaluating models participating in the Earth System Model-Snow Model Intercomparison Project. Periods covered by the in situ data vary between seven and twenty years of hourly meteorological data, with evaluation data (snow depth, snow water equivalent, albedo, soil temperature and surface temperature) available at varying temporal intervals. 30-year (1980–2010) time-series have been extracted from a global gridded surface meteorology dataset (Global Soil Wetness Project Phase 3) for the grid cells containing the reference sites, interpolated to one-hour timesteps and bias corrected. Although applied to all sites, the bias corrections are particularly important for mountain sites that are hundreds of meters higher than the grid elevations; as a result, uncorrected air temperatures are too high and snowfall amounts are too low in comparison with in situ measurements. The discussion considers the importance of data sharing to the identification of errors and how the publication of these datasets contributes to good practice, consistency and reproducibility in Geosciences. Supplementary material provides information on instrumentation, an estimate of the percentages of missing values, and gap-filling methods at each site. It is hoped that these datasets will be used as benchmarks for future model development and that their ease of use and availability will help model developers quantify model uncertainties and reduce model errors. The data are published in the repository PANGAEA and available at: https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.897575.;                         </jats:p>",,,,,,,,,Natural Environment Research Council,https://core.ac.uk/download/211022459.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/essd-2019-12,,10.5194/essd-2019-12,,,0,,1

""Dark nudges"" aim to change consumer behavior against their best interests. ""Sludge"" uses cognitive biases to make behavior change more difficult. We have identified dark nudges and sludge in alcohol industry corporate social responsibility (CSR) materials. These undermine the information on alcohol harms that they disseminate, and may normalize or encourage alcohol consumption. Policymakers and practitioners should be aware of how dark nudges and sludge are used by the alcohol industry to promote misinformation about alcohol harms to the public.; ; CONTEXT: ""Nudges"" and other behavioral economic approaches exploit common cognitive biases (systematic errors in thought processes) in order to influence behavior and decision-making. Nudges that encourage the consumption of harmful products (for example, by exploiting gamblers' cognitive biases) have been termed ""dark nudges."" The term ""sludge"" has also been used to describe strategies that utilize cognitive biases to make behavior change harder. This study aimed to identify whether dark nudges and sludge are used by alcohol industry (AI)-funded corporate social responsibility (CSR) organizations, and, if so, to determine how they align with existing nudge conceptual frameworks. This information would aid their identification and mitigation by policymakers, researchers, and civil society.; ; METHODS: We systematically searched websites and materials of AI CSR organizations (e.g., IARD, Drinkaware, Drinkwise, Educ'alcool); examples were coded by independent raters and categorized for further analysis.; ; FINDINGS: Dark nudges appear to be used in AI communications about ""responsible drinking."" The approaches include social norming (telling consumers that ""most people"" are drinking) and priming drinkers by offering verbal and pictorial cues to drink, while simultaneously appearing to warn about alcohol harms. Sludge, such as the use of particular fonts, colors, and design layouts, appears to use cognitive biases to make health-related information about the harms of alcohol difficult to access, and enhances exposure to misinformation. Nudge-type mechanisms also underlie AI mixed messages, in particular alternative causation arguments, which propose nonalcohol causes of alcohol harms.; ; CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol industry CSR bodies use dark nudges and sludge, which utilize consumers' cognitive biases to promote mixed messages about alcohol harms and to undermine scientific evidence. Policymakers, practitioners, and the public need to be aware of how such techniques are used to nudge consumers toward industry misinformation.

Pepper,"Stem cells have received much attention globally due in part to the immense therapeutic potential they harbor. Unfortunately, malpractice and exploitation (financial and emotional) of vulnerable patients have also drawn attention to this field as a result of the detrimental consequences experienced by some individuals that have undergone unproven stem cell therapies. South Africa has had limited exposure to stem cells and their applications and, while any exploitation is detrimental to the field of stem cells, South Africa is particularly vulnerable in this regard. The current absence of adequate legislation and the inability to enforce existing legislation, coupled to the sea of misinformation available on the Internet could lead to an increase in illegitimate stem cell practices in South Africa. Circumstances are already precarious because of a lack of understanding of concepts involved in stem cell applications. What is more, credible and easily accessible information is not available to the public. This in turn cultivates fears born out of existing superstitions, cultural beliefs, rituals and practices. Certain cultural or religious concerns could potentially hinder the effective application of stem cell therapies in South Africa and novel ways of addressing these concerns are necessary. Understanding how scientific progress and its implementation will affect each individual and, consequently, the community, will be of cardinal importance to the success of the fields of stem cell therapy and regenerative medicine in South Africa. A failure to understand the ethical, cultural or moral ramifications when new scientific concepts are introduced could hinder the efficacy and speed of bringing discoveries to the patient. Neglecting proper procedure for establishing the field would lead to long delays in gaining public support in South Africa.

But how people relied on the broader information environment to understand the crisis and how it was handled by governments has been given less attention. Drawing on a news diary study of 200 participants during the pandemic, we found they easily identified examples of ‘fake news’ but were less aware of relevant facts that might help them understand how the UK government managed the crisis. Our content analysis of 1,259 television news items revealed broadcasters did not routinely draw on statistics to contextualise the UK’s record of managing the coronavirus or regularly make comparisons with other countries. Given television news bulletins were the dominant news source for many people in the UK, we suggest the information environment gave audiences limited opportunities to understand the government’s performance internationally. We argue that misinformation is often a symptom of editorial choices in media coverage – including television news produced by public service broadcasters – that can lead to gaps in public knowledge. We conclude by suggesting the concept of the information environment should play a more prominent role in studies that explore the causes of misinformation.",,,1,19,Government; Content analysis; Political science; Disinformation; Misinformation; Public service; Information environment; Public knowledge; Public relations; Pandemic,,,,Arts and Humanities Research Council,https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/142422/ https://doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2021.1950564 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1461670X.2021.1950564,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670x.2021.1950564,,10.1080/1461670x.2021.1950564,3185107974,,0,010-508-789-534-245; 021-029-812-185-604; 024-934-227-737-411; 029-801-506-288-957; 051-378-206-944-977; 051-866-482-315-686; 051-883-210-071-213; 089-675-495-800-24X; 183-483-056-366-761,0

George,"The outbreak of Ebola that started in West Africa in late 2013 has caused at least 28,000 illnesses and 11,000 deaths. As the outbreak progressed, global and local public health authorities scrambled to contain the spread of the disease by isolating those who were ill, putting in place infection control processes in health care settings, and encouraging the public to take steps to prevent the spread of the illness in the community. It took a massive investment of resources and personnel from many countries to eventually bring the outbreak under control. To determine where to allocate people and resources during the outbreak, public health authorities often turned to mathematical models created by scientists to predict the course of the outbreak and identify interventions that could be effective. Many groups of scientists created models of the epidemic using publically available data or data they obtained from government officials or field studies. In some instances, the models yielded valuable insights. But with various groups using different methods and data, the models didn’t always agree on what would happen next or how best to contain the epidemic. Now, Chretien et al. provide an overview of Ebola mathematical modeling during the epidemic and suggest how future efforts may be improved. The overview included 66 published studies about Ebola outbreak models. Although most forecasts predicted many more cases than actually occurred, some modeling approaches produced more accurate predictions, and several models yielded valuable insights. For example, one study found that focusing efforts on isolating patients with the most severe cases of Ebola would help end the epidemic by substantially reducing the number of new infections. Another study used real-time airline data to predict which traveler screening strategies would be most efficient at preventing international spread of Ebola. Furthermore, studies that obtained genomic data showed how specific virus strains were transmitted across geographic areas. Chretien et al. argue that mathematical modeling efforts could be more useful in future pubic health emergencies if modelers cooperated more, and suggest the collaborative approach of weather forecasters as a good example to follow. Greater data sharing and the creation of standards for epidemic modeling would aid better collaboration.",4,,,,Outbreak; Public health; Government; Health care; Psychological intervention; Data sharing; Sierra leone; Global health; Economic growth; Bioinformatics; Biology,ebola; epidemiology; forecasting; global health; human; modeling,"Africa, Western/epidemiology; Epidemics; Epidemiologic Methods; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola/epidemiology; Humans; Models, Theoretical",,Medical Research Council (MR/K010174/1) United Kingdom; NIGMS NIH HHS (U01 GM110721) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4769159/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26646185 https://elifesciences.org/content/elife/early/2015/12/08/eLife.09186.full.pdf http://europepmc.org/article/MED/26646185 https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/32809 https://elifesciences.org/articles/09186,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.09186,26646185,10.7554/elife.09186,2190947059,PMC4769159,0,000-983-132-800-094; 002-196-366-197-558; 002-441-689-388-208; 003-597-167-812-910; 005-165-620-049-591; 005-346-432-430-822; 007-115-494-974-408; 008-393-920-604-028; 009-196-242-801-519; 010-954-911-531-575; 011-079-823-268-838; 011-430-928-552-689; 011-624-267-354-276; 012-796-093-198-628; 016-572-464-519-252; 016-804-917-302-399; 017-300-737-144-757; 017-343-883-489-905; 018-426-294-617-163; 018-448-200-705-670; 019-124-430-970-811; 019-292-760-096-445; 019-309-528-728-418; 020-545-399-946-442; 021-569-202-222-161; 022-579-111-814-28X; 022-694-766-782-286; 023-358-743-739-238; 023-882-410-955-873; 024-529-960-223-385; 025-704-080-116-081; 027-932-574-333-526; 030-833-975-647-205; 031-022-246-402-782; 032-479-205-888-305; 032-691-502-414-833; 033-864-791-930-576; 033-897-645-682-878; 035-747-275-329-151; 036-893-610-364-571; 037-995-256-380-483; 038-744-249-237-283; 044-898-530-819-671; 045-304-533-001-440; 048-040-979-859-161; 048-089-283-753-358; 049-085-198-863-18X; 050-112-024-212-412; 055-643-023-593-334; 057-227-188-062-531; 057-889-921-749-17X; 059-592-458-336-837; 060-333-230-092-572; 061-036-476-259-091; 064-330-355-627-069; 066-280-200-263-053; 069-754-102-093-063; 070-255-329-160-67X; 072-013-693-378-262; 075-506-110-607-946; 078-243-948-675-341; 082-131-051-426-314; 083-275-795-865-394; 086-896-272-082-252; 090-440-500-853-346; 092-567-618-140-983; 094-502-784-172-599; 094-928-391-835-177; 111-147-596-794-703; 125-241-311-884-051; 145-720-551-618-418; 182-284-825-356-720,103

The original turbofan engine data were from the Prognostic Center of Excellence (PCoE) of NASA Ames Research Center (Saxena and Goebel, 2008), and were simulated by the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) (Saxena et al., 2008). The data set is further divided into ""training"", ""test"" and ""final test"" subsets. It is expected from collaborators to train their models using ""training"" data subset, evaluate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction performance on ""test"" subset and finally, apply the models to the ""final test"" subset for competition. However, the ""final test"" results can only be submitted once by email to PCoE. Before the results are sent for performance evaluation, in order to pre-validate the dataset with true RUL values, this data article introduces reconstructed secondary datasets derived from the noisy degradation patterns of original trajectories. Reconstructed database refers to data that were collected from the training trajectories. Fundamentally, it is formed of individual partial trajectories in which the RUL is known as a ground truth.

Tenenbaum; Susanna-Assunta Sansone; Melissa A. Haendel,"In the era of Big Data , omic-scale technologies, and increasing calls for data sharing, it is generally agreed that the use of community-developed, open data standards is critical. Far less agreed upon is exactly which data standards should be used, the criteria by which one should choose a standard, or even what constitutes a data standard. It is impossible simply to choose a domain and have it naturally follow which data standards should be used in all cases. The ‘right’ standards to use is often dependent on the use case scenarios for a given project. Potential downstream applications for the data, however, may not always be apparent at the time the data are generated. Similarly, technology evolves, adding further complexity. Would-be standards adopters must strike a balance between planning for the future and minimizing the burden of compliance. Better tools and resources are required to help guide this balancing act.",21,2,200,203,Risk analysis (engineering); Health informatics; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Open data; Data Standard; Use case; Computer science; Terminology; Big data; Database,Data Sharing; Data Standards; Information dissemination; Terminology,Biomarkers; Databases as Topic/standards; Information Dissemination; Medical Informatics/standards; Microarray Analysis/standards,Biomarkers,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000771/1) United Kingdom; NCRR NIH HHS (UL1 RR024128) United States; NIH HHS (R24 OD011883) United States; NIH HHS (R24OD011883) United States; NCRR NIH HHS (UL1RR024128) United States; HSRD VA (HIR 10-001) United States; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I025840/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/E025080/1) United Kingdom,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jamia/jamia21.html#TenenbaumSH14 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3932466/ http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/200 https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/21/2/200/2909206 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3932466 https://ohsu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/a-sea-of-standards-for-omics-data-sink-or-swim-2 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jamia/jamia21.html#TenenbaumSH14 https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002066 http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002066,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002066,24076747,10.1136/amiajnl-2013-002066,2132609595,PMC3932466,0,007-717-082-579-207; 008-022-882-186-714; 009-137-685-176-126; 009-599-078-092-066; 010-134-663-025-927; 012-504-220-340-547; 022-354-044-631-944; 024-645-901-447-985; 034-187-986-881-250; 035-397-564-858-212; 047-103-996-053-169; 049-979-756-170-306; 051-773-823-474-544; 056-790-779-670-48X; 060-588-101-806-65X; 063-032-394-923-07X; 068-167-905-176-599; 070-056-377-917-647; 072-057-268-200-230; 078-163-535-210-271; 085-358-128-639-592; 087-292-940-412-878; 094-092-576-012-145; 112-894-414-854-353; 114-941-595-258-981; 118-055-657-395-789; 118-606-819-631-878; 147-637-350-915-358; 149-812-877-439-122; 170-533-798-324-350; 180-290-269-824-463; 195-068-427-015-15X,56

Koenig; Anne Cambon-Thomsen,"Governments, funding bodies, institutions, and publishers have developed a number of strategies to encourage researchers to facilitate access to datasets. The rationale behind this approach is that this will bring a number of benefits and enable advances in healthcare and medicine by allowing the maximum returns from the investment in research, as well as reducing waste and promoting transparency. As this approach gains momentum, these data-sharing practices have implications for many kinds of research as they become standard practice across the world. The governance frameworks that have been developed to support biomedical research are not well equipped to deal with the complexities of international data sharing. This system is nationally based and is dependent upon expert committees for oversight and compliance, which has often led to piece-meal decision-making. This system tends to perpetuate inequalities by obscuring the contributions and the important role of different data providers along the data stream, whether they be low- or middle-income country researchers, patients, research participants, groups, or communities. As research and data-sharing activities are largely publicly funded, there is a strong moral argument for including the people who provide the data in decision-making and to develop governance systems for their continued participation. We recommend that governance of science becomes more transparent, representative, and responsive to the voices of many constituencies by conducting public consultations about data-sharing addressing issues of access and use; including all data providers in decision-making about the use and sharing of data along the whole of the data stream; and using digital technologies to encourage accessibility, transparency, and accountability. We anticipate that this approach could enhance the legitimacy of the research process, generate insights that may otherwise be overlooked or ignored, and help to bring valuable perspectives into the decision-making around international data sharing.",12,1,13,13,Business; Health care; Public engagement; Accountability; Data sharing; Transparency (behavior); Corporate governance; Argument; Public relations; Legitimacy,Data sharing; Digital technologies; Governance; Inclusion; International research; Public engagement,Biomedical Research/ethics; Government; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics,,Medical Research Council (G1001799) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/N01104X/2) United Kingdom; NHGRI NIH HHS (P50 HG004488) United States; Medical Research Council (MR/N01104X/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (096599/2/11/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NHGRI NIH HHS (U01 HG007654) United States,https://core.ac.uk/display/153571221 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/125303/1/125303%20-%20Including%20all%20voices%20in%20international%20data-sharing%20governance.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC5842530 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/125303 https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/articles/t435gg38b https://humgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40246-018-0143-9 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40246-018-0143-9 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8557886/file/8586382.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29514717 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/256119 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/828664 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40246-018-0143-9.pdf https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/downloads/mc87ps592 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/including-all-voices-in-international-data-sharing-governance https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/57626828/KayeEtalHG2018IncludingAllVoices.pdf https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/57626828/KayeEtalHG2018IncludingAllVoices.pdf https://eprints.utas.edu.au/26133/ https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/including-all-voices-in-international-datasharing-governance https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8557886 https://core.ac.uk/download/153571221.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40246-018-0143-9,29514717,10.1186/s40246-018-0143-9,2795340237,PMC5842530,0,000-182-484-526-391; 001-958-475-979-542; 002-482-647-335-731; 003-126-243-629-19X; 004-613-862-207-388; 007-717-082-579-207; 008-480-347-508-96X; 008-862-531-466-53X; 009-373-310-180-940; 017-568-018-567-814; 017-932-547-159-865; 019-538-368-158-59X; 021-413-143-120-286; 022-491-249-147-09X; 026-629-559-633-469; 026-795-122-242-282; 028-740-121-270-032; 031-307-822-369-466; 034-548-036-987-474; 036-138-099-943-445; 048-382-477-690-730; 051-866-191-677-097; 055-239-612-681-266; 077-691-145-063-862; 080-890-380-543-727; 092-302-509-105-202; 094-826-418-720-883; 095-586-015-547-357; 097-088-943-118-521; 099-481-636-147-238; 101-713-460-840-863; 107-521-973-759-413; 123-559-390-700-392; 134-637-235-958-924; 140-441-483-691-854; 188-270-297-190-317,34

J. Melendez-Torres; Helen Elizabeth Morgan; Robert J. Trubey; Michael Robling; Simone Willis; Charlotte Wooders,"Introduction The mental health and well-being of children and young people who have been in care (ie, care-experienced) are a priority. There are a range of interventions aimed at addressing these outcomes, but the international evidence-base remains ambiguous. There is a paucity of methodologically robust systematic reviews of intervention effectiveness, with few considering the contextual conditions under which evaluations were conducted. This is important in understanding the potential transferability of the evidence-base across contexts. The present systematic review will adopt a complex systems perspective to synthesise evidence reporting evaluations of mental health and well-being interventions for care-experienced children and young people. It will address impact, equity, cost-effectiveness, context, implementation and acceptability. Stakeholder consultation will prioritise a programme theory, and associated intervention, that may progress to further development and evaluation in the UK.; ; Methods and analysis We will search 16 bibliographic databases from 1990 to June 2020. Supplementary searching will include citation tracking, author recommendation, and identification of evidence clusters relevant to included evaluations. The eligible population is children and young people (aged ≤25 years) with experience of being in care. Outcomes are (1) mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders; (2) subjective well-being; (3) self-harm; suicidal ideation; suicide. Study quality will be appraised with methodologically appropriate tools. We will construct a taxonomy of programme theories and intervention types. Thematic synthesis will be used for qualitative data reporting context, implementation and acceptability. If appropriate, meta-analysis will be conducted with outcome and economic data.

Ballmer-Weber,"Anaphylaxis has been defined as a 'severe, life-threatening generalized or systemic hypersensitivity reaction'. However, data indicate that the vast majority of food-triggered anaphylactic reactions are not life-threatening. Nonetheless, severe life-threatening reactions do occur and are unpredictable. We discuss the concepts surrounding perceptions of severe, life-threatening allergic reactions to food by different stakeholders, with particular reference to the inclusion of clinical severity as a factor in allergy and allergen risk management. We review the evidence regarding factors that might be used to identify those at most risk of severe allergic reactions to food, and the consequences of misinformation in this regard. For example, a significant proportion of food-allergic children also have asthma, yet almost none will experience a fatal food-allergic reaction; asthma is not, in itself, a strong predictor for fatal anaphylaxis. The relationship between dose of allergen exposure and symptom severity is unclear. While dose appears to be a risk factor in at least a subgroup of patients, studies report that individuals with prior anaphylaxis do not have a lower eliciting dose than those reporting previous mild reactions. It is therefore important to consider severity and sensitivity as separate factors, as a highly sensitive individual will not necessarily experience severe symptoms during an allergic reaction. We identify the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to improve our ability to better identify those most at risk of severe food-induced allergic reactions.",71,9,1241,1255,Risk assessment; Intensive care medicine;

However, because of its novelty and complexity, mental models of blockchain technology are difficult to acquire. Building on embodied cognition theories and material centered-design, we report an innovative approach for the design of BlocKit, a physical three-dimensional kit for materializing blockchain infrastructure and its key entities. Through an engagement with different materials such as clay, paper, or transparent containers we identified important properties of these entities and materialized them through physical artifacts. BlocKit was evaluated by 15 experienced bitcoin users with findings indicating its value for their high level of engagement in communicating about, and designing for blockchain infrastructure. Our study advances an innovative approach for the design of such kits, an initial vocabulary to talk about them, and design implications intended to inspire HCI researchers to engage in designing for infrastructures.",,,1449,1462,Embodied cognition; Key (cryptography); Digital economy; Value (ethics); Vocabulary; Novelty; Blockchain; Disruptive technology; Computer science; Knowledge management,,,,EPSRC,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ACMdis/ACMdis2019.html#KhairuddinSS19 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/132467/ https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/112991061/SpeedDIS2019Blockkit.pdf https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3322276.3322370 https://core.ac.uk/download/228379602.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3322276.3322370,,10.1145/3322276.3322370,2945917989,,0,003-081-612-643-899; 003-242-314-271-104; 004-572-267-519-012; 004-961-138-192-382; 005-911-728-510-273; 006-461-943-048-107; 006-892-596-345-645; 009-847-586-619-872; 013-984-757-893-207; 015-694-529-699-370; 018-585-438-757-594; 019-424-761-370-882; 019-531-417-155-01X; 022-519-437-294-988; 025-918-222-627-99X; 027-606-064-357-823; 031-256-810-076-714; 031-547-621-308-627; 033-931-616-997-906; 035-228-298-856-101; 035-531-798-300-451; 036-082-526-589-939; 042-817-157-389-06X; 044-446-528-679-289; 044-737-699-270-744; 045-415-231-719-045; 050-926-226-607-407; 051-123-258-950-645; 051-994-891-084-520; 052-733-689-605-258; 052-838-339-932-006; 054-220-280-113-169; 054-869-975-578-313; 055-805-270-468-556; 056-705-815-877-324; 057-076-203-668-254; 057-383-919-628-354; 058-009-236-436-78X; 059-931-470-987-724; 060-173-985-852-533; 060-297-545-886-275; 060-801-039-433-29X; 063-336-170-155-158; 072-652-163-464-359; 073-740-704-405-607; 075-442-372-080-312; 080-877-657-803-207; 081-833-651-698-305; 084-702-808-302-890; 088-128-614-143-416; 100-795-227-489-97X; 105-349-441-791-805; 114-665-347-625-879; 117-668-178-820-237; 129-438-398-761-760; 136-146-029-477-712; 136-845-475-226-377; 137-618-464-262-838; 138-576-866-112-553; 151-164-852-105-387; 153-240-485-144-396; 153-277-900-616-004; 154-383-373-729-909; 155-181-769-432-117; 156-584-616-405-380; 162-646-463-588-363; 165-092-204-110-143; 175-262-989-071-106; 179-640-755-585-13X; 184-143-232-304-400; 187-510-461-233-299,5

However, to achieve efficient and meaningful adoption of health care data-sharing initiatives, it is necessary to engage all stakeholders, from health care professionals to patients. Although previous work has assessed health care professionals' perceptions of data sharing, perspectives of the general public and particularly of seldom heard groups have yet to be fully assessed. Objective This study aims to explore the views of the public, particularly their hopes and concerns, around health care data sharing. Methods An original, immersive public engagement interactive experience was developed-The Can of Worms installation-in which participants were prompted to reflect about data sharing through listening to individual stories around health care data sharing. A multidisciplinary team with expertise in research, public involvement, and human-centered design developed this concept. The installation took place in three separate events between November 2018 and November 2019. A combination of convenience and snowball sampling was used in this study. Participants were asked to fill self-administered feedback cards and to describe their hopes and fears about the meaningful use of data in health care. The transcripts were compiled verbatim and systematically reviewed by four independent reviewers using the thematic analysis method to identify emerging themes. Results Our approach exemplifies the potential of using interdisciplinary expertise in research, public involvement, and human-centered design to tell stories, collect perspectives, and spark conversations around complex topics in participatory digital medicine. A total of 352 qualitative feedback cards were collected, each reflecting participants' hopes and fears for health care data sharing. Thematic analyses identified six themes under hopes: enablement of personal access and ownership, increased interoperability and collaboration, generation of evidence for better and safer care, improved timeliness and efficiency, delivery of more personalized care, and equality. The five main fears identified included inadequate security and exploitation, data inaccuracy, distrust, discrimination and inequality, and less patient-centered care. Conclusions This study sheds new light on the main hopes and fears of the public regarding health care data sharing. Importantly, our results highlight novel concerns from the public, particularly in terms of the impact on health disparities, both at international and local levels, and on delivering patient-centered care. Incorporating the knowledge generated and focusing on co-designing solutions to tackle these concerns is critical to engage the public as active contributors and to fully leverage the potential of health care data use.",23,2,e22744,,Snowball sampling; Psychology; Health care; Qualitative research; Public engagement; Health equity; Patient safety; Data sharing; Public relations; Thematic analysis,data security; data sharing; electronic health records; patient participation; patient safety,Adult; Data Analysis; Fear/psychology; Female; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Male; Patient Participation/methods; Patient-Centered Care/methods; Qualitative Research,,British Heart Foundation United Kingdom,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22744 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33616532 https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22744 https://www.jmir.org/2021/2/e22744 https://doaj.org/article/3fe095ae079b475ebed457aebeec699e https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7939935 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33616532 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33616532/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22744,33616532,10.2196/22744,3122702153,PMC7939935,0,000-466-375-419-612; 005-146-851-826-657; 005-422-385-104-558; 009-153-981-874-99X; 009-808-511-781-793; 011-569-487-815-661; 013-912-808-527-31X; 014-675-008-706-176; 015-777-738-932-371; 026-768-019-096-682; 028-105-022-143-617; 033-399-498-608-907; 035-347-858-007-725; 036-212-245-633-772; 044-350-079-774-312; 051-961-903-863-484; 053-218-871-984-223; 062-212-979-552-667; 064-376-451-610-121; 069-890-293-936-399; 072-713-258-146-202; 072-829-867-382-168; 072-836-818-868-474; 080-986-410-560-875; 081-626-963-670-115; 085-320-250-288-390; 089-946-657-072-954; 095-515-879-982-729; 096-073-728-161-73X; 145-810-626-686-562; 167-103-429-107-15X,1

Against these prevalent views we present an ethnomethodological study of digital privacy practices in 20 homes in the UK and France, concentrating in particular upon people’s use of passwords, their management of digital content, and the controls they exercise over the extent to which the online world at large can penetrate their everyday lives. In explicating digital privacy practices in the home we find an abiding methodological concern amongst members to manage the potential ‘attack surface’ of the digital on everyday life occasioned by interaction in and with the networked world. We also find, as a feature of this methodological preoccupation, that privacy dissolves into a heterogeneous array of relationship management practices. Accordingly we propose that ‘privacy’ has little utility as a focus for design, and suggest instead that a more productive way forward would be to concentrate on supporting people’s evident interest in managing their relationships in and with the networked world",26,4-6,453,488,,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://core.ac.uk/download/82925710.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10606-017-9276-y,,10.1007/s10606-017-9276-y,,,0,002-229-365-924-897; 007-677-595-221-629; 008-175-309-437-258; 008-765-756-718-289; 021-459-521-172-184; 023-992-192-899-099; 024-255-918-532-154; 026-445-037-144-418; 031-482-486-719-604; 039-327-749-403-363; 040-566-902-364-57X; 040-743-565-903-804; 047-020-829-223-083; 057-533-217-508-172; 064-132-234-840-835; 065-425-410-565-365; 071-154-840-524-980; 072-345-502-712-370; 074-772-537-963-187; 076-560-835-610-847; 078-462-857-185-347; 080-243-854-902-170; 081-189-154-614-372; 088-082-461-023-374; 093-181-363-973-928; 100-615-806-685-392; 101-064-588-300-762; 101-293-027-008-98X; 101-442-155-142-418; 104-207-666-886-514; 113-437-095-667-528; 115-432-950-191-824; 117-841-468-414-962; 118-769-682-043-149; 119-388-696-650-756; 134-988-090-897-407; 149-377-650-258-649; 152-050-005-414-905; 155-042-472-461-793; 161-783-849-464-480; 165-589-821-141-387; 165-832-261-756-574; 183-465-491-689-566; 188-301-695-829-074,32

Design Prospective comparative study of two electronic literature search strategies. The ‘generic’ search included general terms for health such as ‘adolescent health’, ‘health status’, ‘morbidity’, etc. The ‘specific’ search focused on terms for a range of specific illnesses, such as ‘headache’, ‘epilepsy’, ‘diabetes mellitus’, etc. Data sources The authors searched Medline, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO and the Education Resources Information Center for studies published in English between 1992 and April 2010. Main outcome measures Number and proportion of studies included in the systematic review that were identified from each search. Results The two searches tended to identify different studies. Of 41 studies included in the final review, only three (7%) were identified by both search strategies, 21 (51%) were identified by the generic search only and 17 (41%) were identified by the specific search only. 5 of the 41 studies were also identified through manual searching methods. Studies identified by the two ELS differed in terms of reported health outcomes, while each ELS uniquely identified some of the review9s higher quality studies. Conclusions Electronic literature searches (ELS) are a vital stage in conducting systematic reviews and therefore have an important role in attempts to inform and improve policy and practice with the best available evidence. While the use of both generic and specific health terms is conventional for many reviewers and information scientists, there are also reviews that rely solely on either generic or specific terms. Based on the findings, reliance on only the generic or specific approach could increase the risk of systematic reviews missing important evidence and, consequently, misinforming decision makers. However, future research should test the generalisability of these findings.",2,3,e001043,,Epidemiology; Public health; Systematic review; Electronic literature; Adolescent health; Index (publishing); MEDLINE; PsycINFO; Bioinformatics; Medicine; Applied psychology,,,,Medical Research Council (MC_U130059811) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_U130059812) United Kingdom; Chief Scientist Office (SPHSU1) United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22734117/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/22734117 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/2/3/e001043.full.pdf https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001043 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/3/e001043.full.pdf https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/3/e001043 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/81710/ https://core.ac.uk/display/16460250 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22734117,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001043,22734117,10.1136/bmjopen-2012-001043,2095815624,PMC3383975,0,000-569-192-557-416; 003-679-447-199-072; 006-595-285-380-717; 006-907-117-327-538; 008-708-146-434-94X; 011-373-031-579-256; 013-735-619-108-867; 014-223-936-477-321; 017-541-597-260-824; 018-068-448-268-326; 019-115-465-930-794; 022-452-056-842-588; 026-113-053-530-203; 029-354-547-046-696; 030-489-925-399-397; 031-707-335-211-410; 031-982-343-880-485; 040-325-844-105-23X; 040-477-934-207-400; 046-883-770-822-424; 053-501-316-499-134; 069-160-586-173-239; 084-559-515-208-762; 106-276-769-275-320; 109-212-038-913-567; 117-185-294-774-665; 118-208-002-661-614; 147-476-990-400-104; 170-330-986-971-74X,19

Media risk messages relating to pregnancy or fertility contribute to the context of reproductive decision making, but their fidelity to the underlying science has been questioned. Method: We measured the volume, distribution and content of science-based risk headlines relating to pregnancy or fertility in the UK media over four months. We grouped headlines into unique stories and categorised them by exposure and outcome of interest. We selected four unique stories for closer content analysis and assessed their fidelity to the underlying science, with attention to the role of press releases. Results: We identified 171 headlines over four months (average 43 per month), comprising 56 unique stories. The unique stories most commonly concerned maternal risk factors (n=46) and child health outcomes (n=46). Maternal health outcomes were less frequently the focus (n=20). The most common risk factors in the media coverage were maternal food and drink (n=15), maternal medication and medical interventions (n=9), and maternal health factors (n=6). Media reports were largely faithful to press releases. Where substantive deviations from the underlying scientific study were identified, these could mostly be traced back to press releases or quotes from the study's authors. Press releases often omitted caveats which were reinstated at the media reporting stage, alongside additional expert criticism. Conclusions: Frequent science-based risk messages in the UK media frame mothers as vectors of potential harm to children, who are the focus of health outcomes.

The development of novel digital tools and assessments is likely to increase the need for these. This presents ethics and governance challenges to ensure the use of these data is able to maximise the benefit to patients and the public. We consider the challenges associated with informed consent and governance in the context of dementia research. We set out the potential of novel data governance approaches for the future of data sharing for dementia. The data trust model proposed in discussions of data governance may have potentially valuable application for dementia research. Such inclusive approaches to trustworthy data governance should be considered as data-sharing initiatives are established and develop.,12,1,17,17,Business; Data governance; Geriatric psychiatry; Dementia; Data sharing; Context (language use); Digital health; Corporate governance; Public relations; Informed consent,Data governance; Data sharing; Data trust; Dementia; Digital health; Ethics,Big Data; Biomedical Research/ethics; Dementia; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Informed Consent/ethics; Machine Learning,,Medical Research Council (MR/L023784/2) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L023784/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (206194) United Kingdom,https://www.dementiasplatform.uk/publications/we-need-to-think-about-data-governance-for-dementia-research-in-a-digital-era https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6995068 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6995068 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs13195-020-0584-y https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-020-0584-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13195-020-0584-y,32005135,10.1186/s13195-020-0584-y,3007935833,PMC6995068,0,003-092-235-403-69X; 006-017-529-570-468; 026-882-949-350-455; 037-372-625-724-827; 038-368-681-174-289; 048-032-196-234-421; 048-912-199-333-412; 049-689-566-886-375; 090-608-956-921-294; 108-061-075-809-871; 113-315-500-945-689; 124-389-125-186-801; 131-082-109-939-76X; 135-386-518-562-21X; 183-167-971-983-945,5

Individual interviews and focus groups were conducted with 51 Zulu-speaking men. Three themes related to men's health emerged from the analysis of transcripts: (a) the interweaving of health status and health behaviors in descriptions of ""good"" and ""bad"" fathers, (b) the dominance of positive accounts of health and health status in men's own accounts, and (c) fathers' narratives of transformations and positive reinforcement in health behaviors. The study reveals the pervasiveness of an ideal of healthy fathers, one in which the health of men has practical and symbolic importance not only for men themselves but also for others in the family and community. The study also suggests that men hold in esteem fathers who manage to be involved with their biological children who are not coresident or who are playing a fathering role for nonbiological children (social fathers). In South Africa, men's health interventions have predominantly focused on issues related to HIV and sexual health. The new insights obtained from the perspective of men indicate that there is likely to be a positive response to health interventions that incorporate acknowledgment of, and support for, men's aspirations and lived experiences of social and biological fatherhood. Furthermore, the findings indicate the value of data on men's involvement in families for men's health research in sub-Saharan Africa.",10,6,1.55799E+15,NP50,Social environment; Reproductive health; Psychology; Narrative; Perspective (graphical); Psychological intervention; Value (ethics); Focus group; Gerontology; Dominance (ethology),South Africa; fathers; health; men; qualitative,Adult; Father-Child Relations; Fathers/psychology; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Marriage/psychology; Masculinity; Men's Health; Middle Aged; Parenting/psychology; Rural Population/statistics & numerical data; South Africa; Young Adult,,Wellcome Trust (097410) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT082599MA) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (082384/Z/07/Z) United Kingdom,https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/376757/ https://jmh.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/07/07/1557988315586440.full https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26008734 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1557988315586440 https://khepri-node.dev.meta-infra.org/papers/-i-should-maintain-a-healthy-life-now-and-not/26008734 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/2173731 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1557988315586440 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26008734 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1557988315586440 https://core.ac.uk/download/13117770.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1557988315586440,26008734,10.1177/1557988315586440,2101518729,PMC5305041,0,000-634-426-303-303; 001-472-816-168-490; 002-624-077-732-305; 005-598-112-790-205; 006-425-957-423-504; 007-010-840-655-901; 007-084-108-182-033; 009-661-699-136-417; 011-264-727-312-901; 012-446-723-355-529; 018-510-196-553-524; 020-638-797-602-912; 024-966-985-612-251; 026-317-425-816-54X; 029-009-661-055-767; 029-231-540-873-269; 031-344-942-436-822; 037-633-409-954-348; 041-911-517-758-688; 043-045-778-938-884; 043-249-537-106-627; 045-317-426-784-948; 046-743-951-460-851; 052-315-455-746-419; 053-238-140-092-318; 053-752-981-935-078; 055-116-765-595-553; 062-698-936-962-642; 066-150-506-394-042; 066-537-293-913-641; 067-966-431-894-461; 069-042-770-223-753; 069-156-354-403-478; 069-260-459-124-213; 071-736-075-548-925; 074-469-118-783-77X; 075-072-983-863-863; 076-544-205-840-453; 077-323-141-497-920; 079-733-489-850-670; 081-051-582-323-481; 087-487-206-097-500; 088-500-163-877-776; 090-014-447-944-617; 091-521-306-814-061; 092-478-504-632-002; 093-852-054-608-462; 094-269-335-271-358; 095-462-222-750-10X; 096-198-246-688-642; 096-821-971-979-698; 100-660-583-521-00X; 103-135-162-472-207; 110-200-635-343-467; 113-066-584-914-892; 114-281-774-470-135; 118-907-546-848-025; 138-433-891-364-818; 139-110-931-183-705; 141-059-545-786-357; 144-662-987-598-850; 145-230-875-657-796; 148-522-295-585-750; 150-057-391-986-985; 151-834-316-257-758; 153-916-554-415-872; 164-898-320-802-936; 166-046-443-519-738; 170-119-598-362-367; 174-515-933-003-602; 176-467-144-504-614; 177-076-301-567-490; 197-198-664-704-475,8

This dichotomy fails to capture the complex nature of the cybersex phenomenon, and accordingly, the varied lived experiences of individuals in the context of an emergent “Information Society.” We wish to broaden the discursive space by adopting the affective labor perspective and showcasing cybersex narratives that traverse themes of exploitation, negotiation, resistance, and agency in ICT use. Using two case studies, we illustrate how cybersex is experienced, organized, mediated, and made meaningful. We also describe how laborers are inscribed in mechanisms of surveillance and control, as they develop counter-measures to compromise, challenge or take advantage of these mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that cybersex laborers create value, not just in monetizing their labor, but also in pursuing autonomy, personal development, and kinship-oriented care. The lived experiences of cybersex laborers also produce new and potent forms of bio-politics. These multi-faceted narratives problematize the State-sponsored ICT discourse. On one hand, laborers embody the impositions made upon service-based labor by the global digital economy: rudimentary technological skills, the ability to speak English, the ability to empathize and foster customer relations. On the other, their exclusion engendered the refusal to be subjected to the standards and prerequisites of the legitimate, “formal” digital economy. Cybersex’s anomalous position, we contend, is a reflexive by-product of the neoliberal digital economy that puts premium less on ICT for development and more on labor that serves, foremost, ICT for capital.",69,1,1,21,Agency (philosophy); Reflexivity; Sociology; Negotiation; Digital economy; Information society; Context (language use); Public relations; Personal development; Autonomy; Social psychology,,,,International Development Research Centre,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.1681-4835.2015.tb00499.x https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.1681-4835.2015.tb00499.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.1681-4835.2015.tb00499.x,,10.1002/j.1681-4835.2015.tb00499.x,1763604285,,0,008-528-638-242-217; 027-041-746-983-332; 027-115-003-472-151; 037-925-916-481-99X; 039-043-104-177-085; 058-899-597-955-064; 059-817-773-017-865; 072-258-624-000-595; 090-148-956-072-101; 101-345-869-014-931; 104-454-613-557-846; 166-268-483-130-712; 185-830-846-064-254,5

Today, operators face multiple challenges: a need to innovate and offer a wider choice of value-added services, whilst increasing network scale, bandwidth and flexibility. They must also reduce operational costs, and deploy services far faster - in minutes rather than days or weeks.In the recent years, the network community, motivated by the aforementioned challenges, has developed production network architectures and seeded technologies, like Software Defined Networking, Application-based Network Operations and Network Function Virtualization. These technologies enhance the highly desired properties for elasticity, agility and cost-effectiveness in the operator environment. A key requirement to fully exploit the benefits of these new architectures and technologies is a fundamental shift in management and control of resources, and the ability to orchestrate the network infrastructure: coordinate the instantiation of high-level network services across different technological domains and automate service deployment and re-optimization.This paper surveys existing standardization efforts for the orchestration - automation, coordination, and management - of complex set of network and function resources (both physical and virtual), and highlights the various enabling technologies, strengths and weaknesses, adoption challenges for operators, and areas where further research is required.

Alzheimer’s disease has risen rapidly up national and international policy agendas, particularly in Europe and North America. Research funding and initiatives have proliferated, many of which emphasise the potential value associated with existing data sources. The paper argues that the potential of these initiatives lies not only in realising the value of data through circulation, exchange and recombination, but also in restructuring of the relations of data production and use, notably through the extension and intensification of research participation. As Alzheimer’s research focuses away from clinical settings and symptomatic ‘people with dementia’, participants in existing research studies are reimagined as potential participants in future research studies, as ‘people with data’. Building on analyses of the role of clinical labour in the production of biovalue, the paper argues that reworked relations of data reuse and reproduction suggest the ongoing and repeated attachments between data and bodies involved in the production of value. It concludes that this raises questions related to the study of research participation and requires revisiting discussions about the appropriate representation of research participant interests.",13,3,623,639,Political science; Value (ethics); Production (economics); Research participant; Representation (arts); Disease; Reproduction (economics); Dementia; Public relations; Restructuring,,,,National Institute for Health Research,https://core.ac.uk/display/156827816 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057%2Fs41292-017-0112-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/s41292-017-0112-x,,10.1057/s41292-017-0112-x,2783512519,,0,001-632-080-305-439; 005-523-556-709-811; 005-781-458-034-517; 006-425-128-281-246; 006-594-075-812-273; 008-037-458-997-51X; 008-157-533-487-170; 008-456-938-219-254; 009-391-345-088-756; 011-489-344-295-670; 011-933-288-084-032; 014-112-299-333-154; 015-617-730-549-930; 015-627-071-146-482; 016-267-746-756-036; 016-334-524-772-249; 017-113-713-791-665; 018-675-629-705-93X; 023-015-933-063-553; 025-411-069-190-775; 027-228-835-648-085; 029-913-706-555-075; 030-238-013-988-635; 031-482-788-965-691; 034-432-957-815-701; 034-585-078-378-565; 037-197-823-992-819; 038-099-235-161-119; 041-346-030-558-941; 043-242-896-148-130; 044-291-698-989-788; 045-005-864-712-407; 048-259-416-028-627; 048-382-477-690-730; 051-914-394-761-647; 052-261-715-244-888; 054-010-368-974-793; 056-749-809-543-47X; 057-270-119-705-082; 057-735-491-041-179; 058-072-098-782-589; 058-195-732-445-636; 058-380-956-285-007; 059-565-447-807-580; 064-717-317-374-300; 065-600-625-266-536; 065-915-320-912-134; 066-748-061-274-713; 066-900-901-222-11X; 068-696-954-024-464; 070-564-217-326-902; 071-463-734-678-58X; 074-302-863-308-966; 076-890-672-883-761; 077-192-988-176-666; 083-223-312-687-016; 083-811-991-902-267; 085-788-102-104-821; 086-163-065-832-593; 088-426-789-038-226; 090-246-771-426-478; 090-788-635-189-566; 093-340-103-810-001; 094-369-784-380-689; 095-865-322-365-221; 098-970-647-123-953; 099-137-206-153-272; 101-824-781-259-975; 104-781-539-424-225; 105-502-733-412-043; 107-184-936-567-418; 109-684-761-145-291; 112-531-069-859-707; 117-095-330-419-750; 123-346-941-406-036; 128-585-575-533-480; 128-813-263-026-561; 129-382-759-345-27X; 129-804-463-947-068; 138-332-887-275-625; 142-856-578-665-250; 151-145-563-420-918; 162-377-751-366-404; 167-190-791-185-28X; 168-045-916-782-80X; 168-933-391-449-953; 177-255-273-427-610; 177-377-263-493-732; 180-880-625-817-48X; 185-898-480-114-130; 187-847-412-618-911; 192-534-664-428-894; 196-039-986-223-362; 196-934-843-800-637; 198-192-671-770-218,9

Mars; Saad Jbabdi; Matthew F. S. Rushworth,"Comparative neuroscience is entering the era of big data. New high-throughput methods and data-sharing initiatives have resulted in the availability of large, digital data sets containing many types of data from ever more species. Here, we present a framework for exploiting the new possibilities offered. The multimodality of the data allows vertical translations, which are comparisons of different aspects of brain organization within a single species and across scales. Horizontal translations compare particular aspects of brain organization across species, often by building abstract feature spaces. Combining vertical and horizontal translations allows for more sophisticated comparisons, including relating principles of brain organization across species by contrasting horizontal translations, and for making formal predictions of unobtainable data based on observed results in a model species.",44,1,69,86,Data type; Neuroscience; Feature (archaeology); Digital data; Multimodality; Common space; Single species; Computer science; Horizontal and vertical; Big data,anatomy; connectivity; macaque; model species; mouse; translational neuroscience,Brain; Neurosciences,,Medical Research Council (MR/L009013/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/N019814/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (215573/Z/19/Z) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/P024955/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (203139/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom,https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-neuro-100220-025942 http://europepmc.org/article/MED/33534614 https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/publications/1162443 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F230049 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33534614/ https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/1162443 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/1162443 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/230049,http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-neuro-100220-025942,33534614,10.1146/annurev-neuro-100220-025942,3127139040,,0,001-120-451-868-718; 002-791-956-409-799; 003-079-336-566-926; 003-297-974-211-13X; 003-824-249-940-315; 004-543-441-980-291; 005-727-077-653-392; 006-887-583-594-988; 008-041-643-579-40X; 011-229-774-768-051; 011-604-539-416-496; 013-114-332-640-707; 015-469-785-419-20X; 016-117-206-542-893; 017-396-356-826-083; 017-493-147-321-251; 018-678-941-310-020; 020-383-619-224-46X; 021-212-013-212-798; 021-279-195-446-38X; 021-635-246-216-575; 021-801-815-251-938; 022-231-436-419-125; 025-336-181-725-189; 027-539-997-309-13X; 027-745-069-745-243; 028-620-483-334-957; 029-834-933-999-228; 032-074-239-947-566; 032-339-700-830-990; 033-902-246-989-200; 036-579-899-136-215; 037-355-357-042-525; 037-863-021-690-116; 039-608-260-788-174; 041-995-645-555-587; 042-611-491-010-218; 043-407-800-778-529; 043-634-334-066-830; 043-826-304-928-133; 045-328-149-102-171; 045-445-306-287-054; 045-625-971-527-650; 045-942-624-880-846; 046-665-934-455-646; 047-793-741-036-050; 049-513-267-211-600; 051-009-370-629-270; 051-555-868-980-285; 056-107-248-588-605; 057-764-374-318-944; 061-371-846-271-812; 061-376-722-503-469; 065-036-236-625-182; 065-385-851-258-236; 066-537-855-813-723; 067-996-052-105-730; 068-015-309-381-913; 068-100-086-108-288; 068-636-406-324-955; 070-612-107-164-563; 071-687-712-764-930; 072-634-581-908-814; 074-820-228-360-896; 081-062-035-132-882; 081-802-830-512-199; 084-202-097-824-244; 085-682-270-876-075; 085-926-914-596-377; 085-980-952-915-161; 092-842-048-481-156; 097-536-996-535-421; 101-924-048-301-622; 102-670-947-124-753; 105-593-709-730-849; 107-016-996-660-275; 109-245-632-175-561; 110-459-073-881-062; 110-695-601-034-524; 123-149-238-837-077; 127-339-141-420-243; 134-986-297-514-507; 142-207-079-896-53X; 153-970-370-729-639; 157-813-560-724-907,9

Jill Stocks; Evangelos Kontopantelis; Artur Akbarov; Sarah Rodgers; Anthony J Avery; Darren M. Ashcroft,"Study question: What is the prevalence of different types of potentially hazardous prescribing in general practice in the United Kingdom, and what is the variation between practices?; ; Methods: A cross sectional study included all adult patients potentially at risk of a prescribing or monitoring error defined by a combination of diagnoses and prescriptions in 526 general practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) up to 1 April 2013. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of potentially hazardous prescriptions of anticoagulants, anti-platelets, NSAIDs, β blockers, glitazones, metformin, digoxin, antipsychotics, combined hormonal contraceptives, and oestrogens and monitoring by blood test less frequently than recommended for patients with repeated prescriptions of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and loop diuretics, amiodarone, methotrexate, lithium, or warfarin.; ; Study answer and limitations: 49 927 of 949 552 patients at risk triggered at least one prescribing indicator (5.26%, 95% confidence interval 5.21% to 5.30%) and 21 501 of 182 721 (11.8%, 11.6% to 11.9%) triggered at least one monitoring indicator. The prevalence of different types of potentially hazardous prescribing ranged from almost zero to 10.2%, and for inadequate monitoring ranged from 10.4% to 41.9%. Older patients and those prescribed multiple repeat medications had significantly higher risks of triggering a prescribing indicator whereas younger patients with fewer repeat prescriptions had significantly higher risk of triggering a monitoring indicator. There was high variation between practices for some indicators. Though prescribing safety indicators describe prescribing patterns that can increase the risk of harm to the patient and should generally be avoided, there will always be exceptions where the indicator is clinically justified. Furthermore there is the possibility that some information is not captured by CPRD for some practices—for example, INR results in patients receiving warfarin.; ; What this study adds: The high prevalence for certain indicators emphasises existing prescribing risks and the need for their appropriate consideration within primary care, particularly for older patients and those taking multiple medications. The high variation between practices indicates potential for improvement through targeted practice level intervention.; ; Funding, competing interests, data sharing: National Institute for Health Research through the Greater Manchester Primary Care Patient Safety Translational Research Centre (grant No GMPSTRC-2012-1).

Avraham; Richard J.H. Smith; Jun Shen,"Nonsyndromic hearing loss is genetically heterogeneous. Despite comprehensive genetic testing, many cases remain unsolved because the clinical significance of identified variants is uncertain or because biallelic pathogenic variants are not identified for presumed autosomal recessive cases. Common synonymous variants are often disregarded. Determining the pathogenicity of synonymous variants may improve genetic diagnosis. We report a synonymous variant c.9861 C > T/p.(Gly3287=) in MYO15A in homozygosity or compound heterozygosity with another pathogenic or likely pathogenic MYO15A variant in 10 unrelated families with nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. Biallelic variants in MYO15A were identified in 21 affected and were absent in 22 unaffected siblings. A mini-gene assay confirms that the synonymous variant leads to abnormal splicing. The variant is enriched in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Individuals carrying biallelic variants involving c.9861 C > T often exhibit progressive post-lingual hearing loss distinct from the congenital profound deafness typically associated with biallelic loss-of-function MYO15A variants. This study establishes the pathogenicity of the c.9861 C > T variant in MYO15A and expands the phenotypic spectrum of MYO15A-related hearing loss. Our work also highlights the importance of multicenter collaboration and data sharing to establish the pathogenicity of a relatively common synonymous variant for improved diagnosis and management of hearing loss.",29,6,988,997,Compound heterozygosity; Phenotype; MYO15A; Hearing loss; Sensorineural hearing loss; Genetic testing; Population; Genetics; Genetic heterogeneity; Biology,,,,NIDCD NIH HHS (R01 DC011835) United States; NIDCD NIH HHS (R03 DC013866) United States; NIDCD NIH HHS (R01 DC003544) United States; NIDCD NIH HHS (R01 DC015052) United States; NIDCD NIH HHS (R01 DC017955) United States; NIDCD NIH HHS (R01 DC012049) United States; NIDCD NIH HHS (R01 DC002842) United States; Department of Health United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398081 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-synonymous-variant-in-myo15a-enriched-in-the-ashkenazi-jewish-population-causes-autosomal-recessive-hearing-loss-due-to-abnormal-splicing(a8529015-d83f-40db-8a3a-cd31a86a0f57).html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33398081/ https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-020-00790-w https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8187401 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-020-00790-w.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41431-020-00790-w,33398081,10.1038/s41431-020-00790-w,3119191014,PMC8187401,0,001-379-891-449-376; 005-467-024-547-15X; 006-317-611-496-652; 011-418-128-785-968; 015-113-879-291-254; 015-307-411-123-672; 017-138-283-391-098; 017-826-266-815-329; 021-842-207-418-598; 022-048-836-159-988; 024-571-451-062-076; 025-448-114-102-869; 037-595-770-132-690; 038-454-849-935-952; 043-083-131-914-619; 044-325-993-232-094; 052-546-758-119-373; 054-882-240-079-034; 057-531-349-736-274; 058-195-410-299-277; 060-011-302-030-177; 061-568-004-359-032; 061-747-906-095-105; 062-347-240-500-242; 070-203-313-987-002; 070-368-129-177-718; 075-803-794-871-545; 082-719-798-296-789; 107-663-804-903-887; 112-807-205-590-664; 125-936-242-672-450; 192-577-942-461-951,2

4004,065-258-942-783-317,Data Access Committees.,2020-02-03,2020,journal article,BMC medical ethics,14726939,BioMed Central,United Kingdom,Phaik Yeong Cheah; Jan Piasecki,"Sharing de-identified individual-level health research data is widely promoted and has many potential benefits. However there are also some potential harms, such as misuse of data and breach of participant confidentiality. One way to promote the benefits of sharing while ameliorating its potential harms is through the adoption of a managed access approach where data requests are channeled through a Data Access Committee (DAC), rather than making data openly available without restrictions. A DAC, whether a formal or informal group of individuals, has the responsibility of reviewing and assessing data access requests. Many individual groups, consortiums, institutional and independent DACs have been established but there is currently no widely accepted framework for their organization and function. We propose that DACs, should have the role of both promotion of data sharing and protection of data subjects, their communities, data producers, their institutions and the scientific enterprise. We suggest that data access should be granted by DACs as long as the data reuse has potential social value and provided there is low risk of foreseeable harms. To promote data sharing and to motivate data producers, DACs should encourage secondary uses that are consistent with the interests of data producers and their own institutions. Given the suggested roles of DACs, there should be transparent, simple and clear application procedures for data access. The approach to review of applications should be proportionate to the potential risks involved. DACs should be established within institutional and legal frameworks with clear lines of accountability, terms of reference and membership. We suggest that DACs should not be modelled after research ethics committees (RECs) because their functions and goals of review are different from those of RECs. DAC reviews should be guided by the principles of public health ethics instead of research ethics. In this paper we have suggested a framework under which DACs should operate, how they should be organised, and how to constitute them.",21,1,12,12,Internet privacy; Philosophy of medicine; Business; Research ethics; Accountability; Terms of reference; Data sharing; Data access; Promotion (rank); Confidentiality,Data Access Committee; Data sharing; Ethics; Research ethics; Research ethics committees,"Access to Information/ethics; Confidentiality/ethics; Ethics Committees, Research/organization & administration; Ethics, Research; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Social Responsibility",,Wellcome Trust (096527) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (106698/Z/14/J) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (106698/Z/14/Z) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-020-0453-z https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12910-020-0453-z.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-020-0453-z http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-020-0453-z https://doaj.org/article/1879052c9df84927bf6d55b52720e7a4 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32013947 https://philpapers.org/rec/PIADAC https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-020-0453-z https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/1086202 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32013947 https://www.tropmedres.ac/publications/1086202 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1086202 https://core.ac.uk/download/361287168.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-020-0453-z,32013947,10.1186/s12910-020-0453-z,3006005915,PMC6998828,0,000-647-046-871-512; 000-962-872-730-72X; 005-308-110-095-761; 005-963-141-245-049; 006-565-656-719-605; 007-703-839-326-643; 007-734-628-091-161; 012-005-129-242-245; 018-167-491-270-599; 021-632-051-192-565; 021-647-780-229-032; 023-097-073-292-349; 024-529-576-002-238; 024-749-534-048-013; 027-456-782-420-718; 028-232-069-918-098; 029-170-163-688-183; 030-804-649-042-451; 031-814-590-043-737; 033-312-804-306-305; 037-093-679-560-520; 038-999-851-882-968; 039-455-911-673-238; 040-960-673-918-764; 041-351-846-842-204; 041-793-380-727-72X; 043-461-666-754-223; 045-171-039-374-851; 049-500-188-704-949; 052-420-738-035-064; 053-609-575-603-914; 060-711-673-569-152; 069-666-005-621-303; 073-267-268-269-90X; 076-999-905-905-239; 078-284-561-205-40X; 084-222-931-040-416; 087-036-518-204-018; 087-370-914-882-420; 092-783-652-547-548; 094-112-337-177-837; 097-628-129-516-247; 097-938-170-367-566; 098-422-711-641-097; 098-981-344-002-47X; 099-481-636-147-238; 135-302-870-468-483; 142-137-110-156-791; 171-308-356-481-477; 190-723-198-576-872,8

Puttick,"Ancestral state reconstruction of discrete character traits is often vital when attempting to understand the origins and homology of traits in living species. The addition of fossils has been shown to alter our understanding of trait evolution in extant taxa, but researchers may avoid using fossils alongside extant species if only few are known, or if the designation of the trait of interest is uncertain. Here, I investigate the impacts of fossils and incorrectly coded fossils in the ancestral state reconstruction of discrete morphological characters under a likelihood model. Under simulated phylogenies and data, likelihood-based models are generally accurate when estimating ancestral node values. Analyses with combined fossil and extant data always outperform analyses with extant species alone, even when around one quarter of the fossil information is incorrect. These results are especially pronounced when model assumptions are violated, such as when there is a trend away from the root value. Fossil data are of particular importance when attempting to estimate the root node character state. Attempts should be made to include fossils in analysis of discrete traits under likelihood, even if there is uncertainty in the fossil trait data.",12,8,20160392,,Trait; Extant taxon; Ecology; Character traits; Biology; Phylogenetics,ancestral states; discrete characters; fossils; phylogeny,Fossils; Likelihood Functions; Phenotype; Phylogeny,,Natural Environment Research Council,http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/8/20160392 https://core.ac.uk/display/73983244 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/partially-incorrect-fossil-data-augment-analyses-of-discrete-trai https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/files/81291105/Puttick_2016.pdf https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0392 https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0392 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5014033/ https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/partially-incorrect-fossil-data-augment-analyses-of-discrete-trai http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5014033 https://core.ac.uk/download/73983244.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2016.0392,27484647,10.1098/rsbl.2016.0392,2475870013,PMC5014033,0,002-125-344-764-162; 003-298-743-916-858; 005-248-158-852-889; 008-178-946-810-565; 013-242-770-599-421; 036-938-399-750-907; 040-445-117-915-478; 049-837-971-407-958; 051-108-417-729-361; 052-670-513-018-898; 055-022-725-561-933; 060-145-121-059-097; 065-317-215-582-428; 095-967-597-376-330; 100-320-690-148-377; 120-231-722-643-585; 121-410-964-346-217; 137-725-018-837-535,18

These data served as model input data for the first multi-objective spatio-temporal optimisation of Philippine rice value chains. Data on available farmland area and their characteristics, such as paddy rice yield, rice farming costs and GHG emissions, are reported. As scenarios were developed for optimal rice value chains of integrated food and non-food production, estimates on the spatio-temporal demands on food, energy, fuels and chemical are presented. Data on sale prices and GHG emission factors of the raw materials and products are also compiled. Processing and transporting technologies involved in the modelling have their economic and operating parameters presented in this paper. This dataset has been collated through academic journals, technical papers and government agencies; all of which have been properly referenced.

Brown,"Most expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies to date have been performed in heterogeneous tissues as opposed to specific cell types. To better understand the cell-type-specific regulatory landscape of human melanocytes, which give rise to melanoma but account for <5% of typical human skin biopsies, we performed an eQTL analysis in primary melanocyte cultures from 106 newborn males. We identified 597,335 cis-eQTL SNPs prior to linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning and 4997 eGenes (FDR < 0.05). Melanocyte eQTLs differed considerably from those identified in the 44 GTEx tissue types, including skin. Over a third of melanocyte eGenes, including key genes in melanin synthesis pathways, were unique to melanocytes compared to those of GTEx skin tissues or TCGA melanomas. The melanocyte data set also identified trans-eQTLs, including those connecting a pigmentation-associated functional SNP with four genes, likely through cis-regulation of IRF4 Melanocyte eQTLs are enriched in cis-regulatory signatures found in melanocytes as well as in melanoma-associated variants identified through genome-wide association studies. Melanocyte eQTLs also colocalized with melanoma GWAS variants in five known loci. Finally, a transcriptome-wide association study using melanocyte eQTLs uncovered four novel susceptibility loci, where imputed expression levels of five genes (ZFP90, HEBP1, MSC, CBWD1, and RP11-383H13.1) were associated with melanoma at genome-wide significant P-values. Our data highlight the utility of lineage-specific eQTL resources for annotating GWAS findings, and present a robust database for genomic research of melanoma risk and melanocyte biology.",28,11,1621,1635,Genome-wide association study; Single-nucleotide polymorphism; Expression quantitative trait loci; Genetic association; Melanoma; Melanocyte; Linkage disequilibrium; Genetics; Quantitative trait locus; Biology,,"Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics; Carrier Proteins/genetics; Cells, Cultured; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Heme-Binding Proteins; Hemeproteins/genetics; Humans; Interferon Regulatory Factors/genetics; Linkage Disequilibrium; Melanocytes/metabolism; Melanoma/genetics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Repressor Proteins","Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Carrier Proteins; HEBP1 protein, human; Heme-Binding Proteins; Hemeproteins; Interferon Regulatory Factors; MSC protein, human; Repressor Proteins; ZFP90 protein, human; interferon regulatory factor-4",NCI NIH HHS (R01 CA133996) United States; NCI NIH HHS (R01 CA083115) United States; NCI NIH HHS (P50 CA097007) United States; Cancer Research UK (C8216/A6129) United Kingdom; NIEHS NIH HHS (R01 ES011740) United States; Cancer Research UK (C588/A4994 ) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (C588/A10589) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (C490/A10124 ) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK ( C588/A19167 ) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (C1287/A10118 ) United Kingdom; NCI NIH HHS (P50 CA093459) United States; Cancer Research UK (10589) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L01629X/1) United Kingdom,http://busqueda.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-30333196 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Ascholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl%3Aitem_3006491 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6211648 https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/cell-type-specific-eqtl-of-primary-melanocytes-facilitates-identi https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/04012dfe-e140-4e2c-88d3-b53daf36aa5f https://iris.unige.it/handle/11567/935471 https://repository.icr.ac.uk/handle/internal/3046 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30333196 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30333196/ https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/138528/ https://busqueda.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/es/mdl-30333196 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/30333196 https://portal.research.lu.se/en/publications/cell-type-specific-eqtl-of-primary-melanocytes-facilitates-identi https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/168402419.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/gr.233304.117,30333196,10.1101/gr.233304.117,2952207039,PMC6211648,0,000-943-968-890-898; 001-459-978-533-044; 001-645-586-925-38X; 002-640-487-902-83X; 003-668-805-293-605; 004-265-955-030-413; 004-698-193-068-864; 005-249-059-340-495; 006-020-671-397-667; 009-050-942-828-577; 009-741-119-223-806; 009-954-059-241-955; 010-192-107-866-712; 010-878-189-062-991; 012-029-198-500-777; 013-438-701-306-343; 013-620-578-946-994; 014-473-611-444-865; 015-040-135-433-278; 016-070-439-124-064; 016-625-397-589-459; 016-756-670-501-930; 017-852-836-564-058; 018-682-921-416-524; 019-648-650-178-17X; 021-166-053-811-459; 022-172-326-710-563; 022-635-111-645-432; 023-839-310-151-874; 023-975-787-684-412; 024-087-990-343-470; 026-526-240-865-151; 027-191-646-279-827; 027-319-786-190-250; 030-664-851-842-987; 032-635-197-510-565; 033-153-909-143-711; 033-807-863-963-617; 034-052-536-206-41X; 034-118-746-410-370; 034-370-285-339-798; 035-875-004-698-701; 038-414-762-756-023; 038-891-854-405-425; 039-096-673-190-684; 039-690-636-299-009; 039-916-102-293-541; 041-569-524-747-409; 041-701-598-295-05X; 042-328-770-811-188; 042-457-321-159-287; 044-270-740-367-622; 045-519-822-177-993; 046-296-672-003-349; 047-627-778-472-67X; 047-836-956-990-607; 047-904-644-577-559; 048-967-483-353-507; 049-336-940-718-627; 049-570-130-920-351; 049-837-281-599-446; 052-673-618-191-842; 053-370-563-090-523; 054-663-769-312-289; 055-094-909-709-026; 062-326-223-978-196; 062-493-423-322-640; 072-343-999-123-395; 073-413-668-831-757; 075-062-108-093-734; 083-264-876-655-061; 084-722-680-800-118; 086-709-663-555-030; 088-416-548-533-104; 088-683-708-778-95X; 089-319-237-606-443; 091-080-489-717-289; 091-771-007-910-848; 095-312-420-059-48X; 098-761-138-998-267; 115-396-470-398-046; 117-891-831-157-207; 130-191-558-926-987; 150-325-162-873-23X; 166-822-383-562-791; 178-766-186-547-463,39

Design Explanatory mixed-methods design. Setting A rural population of 1.02 million in the Samastipur district of Bihar, India. Participants Based on their knowledge of health status of families, community health workers or CHWs (called accredited social health activist or locally) and informal providers referred people to the programme. The field coordinators (FCs) in the programme screened the referrals for TB symptoms to identify presumptive TB cases. CHWs accompanied the presumptive TB patients to free diagnostic evaluation, and a transport allowance was given to the patients. Thereafter, CHWs initiated and supported the treatment of confirmed cases. We included 13 395 community referrals received between January and December 2018. To understand the reasons of the PDLFU, we conducted in-depth interviews with patients who were evaluated (n=3), patients who were not evaluated (n=4) and focus group discussions with the CHWs (n=2) and FCs (n=1). Outcome measures Proportion and characteristics of PDLFU and association of demographic and symptom characteristics with diagnostic evaluation. Results A total of 11 146 presumptive TB cases were identified between January and December 2018, out of which 4912 (44.1%) underwent diagnostic evaluation. In addition to the free TB services in the public sector, the key enablers were CHW accompaniment and support. The major barriers identified were misinformation and stigma, deficient family and health provider support, transport challenges and poor services in the public health system. Conclusion Finding the missing cases will require patient-centric diagnostic services and urgent reform in the health system.

Swaminathan,"DECIPHER (https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk) is a web-based platform for secure deposition, analysis, and sharing of plausibly pathogenic genomic variants from well-phenotyped patients suffering from genetic disorders. DECIPHER aids clinical interpretation of these rare sequence and copy-number variants by providing tools for variant analysis and identification of other patients exhibiting similar genotype-phenotype characteristics. DECIPHER also provides mechanisms to encourage collaboration among a global community of clinical centers and researchers, as well as exchange of information between clinicians and researchers within a consortium, to accelerate discovery and diagnosis. DECIPHER has contributed to matchmaking efforts by enabling the global clinical genetics community to identify many previously undiagnosed syndromes and new disease genes, and has facilitated the publication of over 700 peer-reviewed scientific publications since 2004. At the time of writing, DECIPHER contains anonymized data from ∼250 registered centers on more than 51,500 patients (∼18000 patients with consent for data sharing and ∼25000 anonymized records shared privately). In this paper, we describe salient features of the platform, with special emphasis on the tools and processes that aid interpretation, sharing, and effective matchmaking with other data held in the database and that make DECIPHER an invaluable clinical and research resource.",36,10,941,949,Identification (biology); DECIPHER; Data science; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Web browser; New disease; Resource (project management); Bioinformatics; Medical genetics; Biology,MatchMaker Exchange; genetic disorders; genotype-phenotype correlation; rare diseases,"Databases, Genetic; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics; Genetic Variation; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Phenotype; Rare Diseases/genetics; Software; User-Computer Interface; Web Browser",,Wellcome Trust (WT077008) United Kingdom,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/humu.22842 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4832335/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/humu.22842 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/26220709/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26220709/ https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4832335,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/humu.22842,26220709,10.1002/humu.22842,2115350162,PMC4832335,0,000-457-304-981-080; 001-217-088-783-103; 002-224-054-944-652; 002-676-051-912-775; 007-025-390-769-793; 011-831-311-825-058; 012-063-758-810-423; 013-240-333-952-646; 014-531-754-961-176; 019-343-902-091-525; 019-427-518-664-040; 024-292-988-457-068; 027-962-030-524-698; 030-289-373-974-376; 032-349-254-559-465; 034-698-274-989-102; 036-791-167-715-13X; 038-308-014-545-918; 040-553-666-988-045; 044-259-816-890-421; 049-592-790-816-493; 051-848-709-463-327; 056-183-913-436-471; 057-481-818-486-309; 058-501-204-693-460; 063-402-525-465-255; 066-197-125-723-998; 069-643-726-648-344; 075-002-140-707-99X; 075-079-497-123-351; 078-975-963-888-306; 080-527-648-840-292; 080-552-286-878-764; 081-840-285-500-316; 082-259-019-091-318; 083-063-384-983-148; 087-578-514-383-764; 093-830-097-814-293; 096-925-511-700-939; 102-394-722-911-221; 111-371-173-723-301; 112-128-509-159-510; 127-982-466-222-045; 144-287-342-263-090; 153-579-164-869-620; 186-496-549-480-011,31

Wilson; Daniel Herron; Parashkev Nachev; Nick McNally; Bryan Williams; Geraint Rees,"Research and innovation in biomedicine and health care increasingly depend on electronic data. The emergence of data-driven technologies and associated digital transformations has focused attention on the value of such data. Despite the broad consensus of the value of health data, there is less consensus on the basis for that value; thus, the nature and extent of health data value remain unclear. Much of the existing literature presupposes that the value of data is to be understood primarily in financial terms, and assumes that a single financial value can be assigned. We here argue that the value of a dataset is instead relational; that is, the value depends on who wants to use it and for what purposes. Moreover, data are valued for both nonfinancial and financial reasons. Thus, it may be more accurate to discuss the values (plural) of a dataset rather than the singular value. This plurality of values opens up an important set of questions about how health data should be valued for the purposes of public policy. We argue that public value models provide a useful approach in this regard. According to public value theory, public value is created, or captured, to the extent that public sector institutions further their democratically established goals, and their impact on improving the lives of citizens. This article outlines how adopting such an approach might be operationalized within existing health care systems such as the English National Health Service, with particular focus on actionable conclusions.",22,3,e15816,,Public economics; Public policy; Business; Public sector; Health care; Value (mathematics); Public value; Electronic data; Health policy; Operationalization,NHS Constitution; health policy; innovation; intellectual property; public value,Data Analysis; Health Services/standards; Humans; Public Policy/trends,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32217501/ https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7148544 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148544 https://www.jmir.org/2020/3/e15816/,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/15816,32217501,10.2196/15816,3013162495,PMC7148544,0,037-673-206-268-344; 052-650-973-388-074; 073-109-819-986-646; 077-903-356-272-623; 116-588-546-666-32X; 124-127-461-629-464; 159-911-485-494-858; 162-725-859-796-180; 174-445-408-150-777,0

Verkooijen,"Purpose: MR-guided Radiation Therapy (MRgRT) allows for high-precision radiotherapy under real-time MR visualization. This enables margin reduction and subsequent dose escalation which may lead to higher tumor control and less toxicity. The Unity MR-linac (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) integrates a linear accelerator with a 1.5T diagnostic quality MRI and an online adaptive workflow. A prospective international registry was established to facilitate the evidence-based implementation of the Unity MR-linac into clinical practice, to systemically evaluate long-term outcomes, and to aid further technical development of MR-linac-based MRgRT. Methods and Results: In February 2019, the Multi-OutcoMe EvaluatioN of radiation Therapy Using the MR-linac study (MOMENTUM) started within the MR-linac Consortium. The MOMENTUM study is an international academic-industrial partnership between several hospitals and industry partner Elekta. All patients treated on the MR-linac are eligible for inclusion in MOMENTUM. For participants, we collect clinical patient data (e.g., patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics) and technical patient data which is defined as information generated on the MR-linac during treatment. The data are captured, pseudonymized, and stored in an international registry at set time intervals up to two years after treatment. Patients can choose to provide patient-reported outcomes and consent to additional MRI scans acquired on the MR-linac. This registry will serve as a data platform that supports multicenter research investigating the MR-linac. Rules and regulations on data sharing, data access, and intellectual property rights are summarized in an academic-industrial collaboration agreement. Data access rules ensure secure data handling and research integrity for investigators and institutions. Separate data access rules exist for academic and industry partners. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with ID: NCT04075305 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04075305). Conclusion: The multi-institutional MOMENTUM study has been set up to collect clinical and technical patient data to advance technical development, and facilitate evidenced-based implementation of MR-linac technology with the ultimate purpose to improve tumor control, survival, and quality of life of patients with cancer.",10,,1328,,Evidence-based practice; Workflow; Medical physics; Quality of life (healthcare); Data sharing; Pseudonymized; Data access; Radiation therapy; General partnership; Medicine,MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT); MR-linac; MRI; adaptive radiotherapy; functional imaging; image-guidance; magnetic resonance imaging; radiotherapy,,,Medical Research Council (MC_EX_MR/M009068/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M009068/1) United Kingdom; NCI NIH HHS (R01 CA218148) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33014774 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33014774/ https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fonc.2020.01328/full https://repository.icr.ac.uk/handle/internal/4109 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2020.01328/full https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-momentum-study-an-international-registry-for-the-evidencebased-introduction-of-mrguided-adaptive-therapy(f39126a5-2192-4752-b1a0-459466193cec).html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7505056,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01328,33014774,10.3389/fonc.2020.01328,3083705298,PMC7505056,0,000-837-531-686-764; 005-533-886-123-433; 010-458-784-241-336; 012-123-987-531-200; 015-757-288-602-149; 016-068-028-283-041; 022-526-129-975-007; 032-684-616-922-54X; 037-402-704-968-859; 042-818-013-567-335; 047-049-073-367-798; 053-063-434-177-374; 060-261-288-533-107; 065-841-310-362-686; 067-689-203-692-654; 070-462-022-251-464; 082-454-791-743-872; 115-910-509-486-182; 115-934-625-126-957; 119-588-056-870-212; 139-488-628-396-673; 148-627-171-679-756,26

Edelson; Yadin Dudai; Raymond J. Dolan; Tali Sharot,"Humans are strongly influenced by their environment, a dependence that can lead to errors in judgment. Although a rich literature describes how people are influenced by others, little is known regarding the factors that predict subsequent rectification of misleading influence. Using a mediation model in combination with brain imaging, we propose a model for the correction of misinformation. Specifically, our data suggest that amygdala modulation of hippocampal mnemonic representations, during the time of misleading social influence, is associated with reduced subsequent anterior-lateral prefrontal cortex activity that reflects correction. These findings illuminate the process by which erroneous beliefs are, or fail to be, rectified and highlight how past influence constrains subsequent correction.",34,23,7744,7753,Social influence; Psychology; Neuroscience; Cognitive psychology; Mnemonic; Misinformation; Amygdala; Prefrontal cortex; Neuroimaging; Mediation (statistics),brain; fMRI; memory; recovery; social,"Adult; Brain/blood supply; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Judgment/physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory/physiology; Models, Psychological; Neural Pathways/blood supply; Oxygen/blood; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time/physiology; Social Behavior",Oxygen,Wellcome Trust (098362) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (098362/Z/12/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (091593/Z/10/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (091593) United Kingdom,http://affectivebrain.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/7744.full_.pdf https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/34/23/7744.full.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24899698/ http://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/23/7744.full http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/doi/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4720-13.2014 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4044241 https://www.jneurosci.org/content/34/23/7744 https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2614980 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24899698 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1432423 http://www.weizmann.ac.il/neurobiology/labs/dudai/uploads/files/Edelson_et_al_2014.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/20484223.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.4720-13.2014,24899698,10.1523/jneurosci.4720-13.2014,2066572327,PMC4044241,0,001-285-470-849-761; 001-422-631-837-381; 004-165-239-429-599; 006-014-026-735-415; 006-049-115-222-566; 006-358-849-657-832; 013-479-884-856-305; 017-877-076-679-725; 021-651-864-336-638; 023-311-815-111-602; 023-349-306-976-61X; 023-539-174-866-167; 024-488-175-826-879; 024-815-787-987-361; 025-665-736-938-311; 026-840-856-114-837; 027-591-484-219-196; 028-538-290-446-853; 029-108-559-228-274; 031-282-599-341-357; 031-887-268-627-555; 034-228-242-568-374; 034-277-227-046-413; 034-548-898-277-230; 037-308-242-395-484; 041-584-712-400-221; 041-899-773-466-01X; 042-367-882-793-756; 042-567-638-248-170; 043-661-884-714-63X; 044-253-332-833-255; 044-261-401-248-94X; 045-266-825-185-291; 047-653-945-198-364; 048-695-086-651-184; 049-554-153-335-681; 052-339-973-592-313; 053-459-201-895-587; 053-496-180-165-181; 054-417-344-336-45X; 054-878-095-964-405; 055-437-939-009-559; 056-921-947-185-430; 059-042-646-939-356; 059-943-435-322-573; 060-107-127-707-318; 064-678-095-512-675; 071-635-628-519-858; 072-217-087-834-867; 072-301-745-806-107; 072-372-118-934-60X; 076-365-063-563-855; 076-483-968-109-005; 079-185-995-330-534; 083-039-845-445-060; 087-628-436-805-310; 088-338-481-207-572; 090-188-383-241-516; 090-200-527-143-763; 098-271-349-347-382; 098-767-319-842-71X; 098-854-908-444-862; 100-340-621-911-55X; 102-546-897-513-647; 104-181-893-049-65X; 110-307-875-252-302; 113-973-431-964-847; 117-661-504-748-233; 127-052-580-657-455; 131-252-409-108-465; 133-322-350-187-907; 146-634-302-598-095; 162-431-275-304-871; 167-143-362-070-917; 185-776-606-596-900; 188-718-649-281-750; 189-166-522-216-146; 192-938-343-583-595,24

Harnessing the potential of these technologies will necessitate partnerships between health institutions and commercial companies, particularly as it relates to sharing health data. The need for commercial companies to be trustworthy users of data has been argued to be critical to the success of this endeavour. I argue that this approach is mistaken. Our interactions with commercial companies need not, and should not, be based on trust. Rather, they should be based on confidence. I begin by elucidating the differences between trust, reliability, and confidence, and argue that trust is not the appropriate attitude to adopt when it comes to sharing data with commercial companies. I argue that what we really should want is confidence in a system of data sharing. I then provide an outline of what a confidence-worthy system of data sharing with commercial companies might look like, and conclude with some remarks about the role of trust within this system.",,,medethics,2021-107464,Information technology; Business; Trustworthiness; Research ethics; Health care; Power (social and political); Data sharing; Health data; Reliability (statistics); Knowledge management,confidentiality/privacy; databases- genetic; ethics; ethics- research; information technology,,,Wellcome; UK Research and Innovation,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:799cf1fc-014d-43d1-a397-1f5565637ff5 https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2021/07/29/medethics-2021-107464 https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/early/2021/07/29/medethics-2021-107464.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107464,34330796,10.1136/medethics-2021-107464,3184999087,,0,004-613-862-207-388; 005-467-973-542-14X; 005-589-000-685-924; 009-385-547-866-383; 012-869-218-364-795; 015-287-242-835-920; 016-698-326-636-091; 020-370-144-042-714; 023-698-315-722-430; 023-856-474-910-405; 029-086-175-099-915; 030-305-706-347-985; 033-923-287-448-622; 036-138-700-226-851; 040-991-092-491-290; 052-477-508-257-734; 054-268-565-502-005; 055-741-011-642-687; 060-879-550-979-345; 065-150-064-642-697; 073-267-268-269-90X; 075-129-083-536-095; 075-465-734-221-082; 089-915-058-956-270; 094-687-272-202-815; 096-327-747-748-955; 097-487-662-075-527; 111-389-890-923-942; 113-239-195-094-424; 119-907-660-695-225; 136-408-801-247-072; 149-705-439-025-874; 150-888-364-401-926; 156-882-406-570-586; 185-589-774-507-993; 190-916-915-049-866,0

In the present study, we compare three potentially effective strategies in vaccine promotion: one contrasting myths vs. facts, one employing fact and icon boxes, and one showing images of non-vaccinated sick children. Beliefs in the autism/vaccines link and in vaccines side effects, along with intention to vaccinate a future child, were evaluated both immediately after the correction intervention and after a 7-day delay to reveal possible backfire effects. Results show that existing strategies to correct vaccine misinformation are ineffective and often backfire, resulting in the unintended opposite effect, reinforcing ill-founded beliefs about vaccination and reducing intentions to vaccinate.

Palmieri,"Background: Studies that identify children after acute trauma and prospectively track risk/protective factors and trauma responses over time are resource-intensive; small sample sizes often limit power and generalizability. The Prospective studies of Acute Child Trauma and Recovery (PACT/R) Data Archive was created to facilitate more robust integrative cross-study data analyses. Objectives: To (a) describe creation of this research resource, including harmonization of key variables; (b) describe key study- and participant-level variables; and (c) examine retention to follow-up across studies. Methods: For the first 30 studies in the Archive, we described study-level (design factors, retention rates) and participant-level (demographic, event, traumatic stress) variables. We used Chi square or ANOVA to examine study- and participant-level variables potentially associated with retention. Results: These 30 prospective studies (N per study = 50 to 568; overall N = 5499) conducted by 15 research teams in 5 countries enrolled children exposed to injury (46%), disaster (24%), violence (13%), traffic accidents (10%), or other acute events. Participants were school-age or adolescent (97%), 60% were male, and approximately half were of minority ethnicity. Using harmonized data from 22 measures, 24% reported significant traumatic stress ≥1 month post-event. Other commonly assessed outcomes included depression (19 studies), internalizing/externalizing symptoms (19), and parent mental health (19). Studies involved 2 to 5 research assessments; 80% of participants were retained for ≥2 assessments. At the study level, greater retention was associated with more planned assessments. At the participant level, adolescents, minority youth, and those of lower socioeconomic status had lower retention rates.

These allow researchers to report their complete results in a unified way. However, at present, there is no format to describe the final qualitative and quantitative results for proteomics and metabolomics experiments in a simple tabular format. Many downstream analysis use cases are only concerned with the final results of an experiment and require an easily accessible format, compatible with tools such as Microsoft Excel or R. We developed the mzTab file format for MS-based proteomics and metabolomics results to meet this need. mzTab is intended as a lightweight supplement to the existing standard XML-based file formats (mzML, mzIdentML, mzQuantML), providing a comprehensive summary, similar in concept to the supplemental material of a scientific publication. mzTab files can contain protein, peptide, and small molecule identifications together with experimental metadata and basic quantitative information. The format is not intended to store the complete experimental evidence but provides mechanisms to report results at different levels of detail. These range from a simple summary of the final results to a representation of the results including the experimental design. This format is ideally suited to make MS-based proteomics and metabolomics results available to a wider biological community outside the field of MS. Several software tools for proteomics and metabolomics have already adapted the format as an output format. The comprehensive mzTab specification document and extensive additional documentation can be found online.",13,10,2765,2775,World Wide Web; Mass spectrometry data format; Data exchange; Information retrieval; Software; Proteomics Standards Initiative; Data sharing; Computer science; XML; Metadata; File format,,"Access to Information; Databases, Protein; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics; Proteomics; Software; User-Computer Interface",,Wellcome Trust (WT101477MA) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT085949MA) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/H024654/1) United Kingdom; NIGMS NIH HHS (P41 GM103484) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (P41 GM103485) United States; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000909/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/K01997X/1) United Kingdom; NIGMS NIH HHS (8P41GM103485-05) United States; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I00095X/1) United Kingdom,https://bibliographie.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/60198 https://graz.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/the-mztab-data-exchange-format-communicating-ms-based-proteomics- https://www.mcponline.org/lookup/doi/10.1074/mcp.O113.036681 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4189001/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24980485 https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/60198 https://www.academia.edu/62566741/The_mzTab_Data_Exchange_Format_communicating_MS_based_proteomics_and_metabolomics_experimental_results_to_a_wider_audience http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2071170 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/269538 https://www.mcponline.org/article/S1535-9476(20)32821-8/fulltext https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2071170 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1535947620328218 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4189001 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Juan_Vizcaino/publication/263582336_The_mzTab_Data_Exchange_Format_Communicating_Mass-spectrometry-based_Proteomics_and_Metabolomics_Experimental_Results_to_a_Wider_Audience/links/54905e300cf214269f266835.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/33149637.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1074/mcp.o113.036681,24980485,10.1074/mcp.o113.036681,1964336313,PMC4189001,0,002-903-758-058-194; 005-259-725-418-055; 006-803-941-604-090; 008-018-539-321-470; 008-125-329-841-922; 016-339-567-022-387; 016-566-535-787-756; 018-556-311-708-039; 019-018-042-761-058; 020-693-508-188-420; 021-467-715-764-655; 025-601-721-539-497; 026-603-021-566-449; 028-251-065-363-041; 036-965-888-787-034; 038-158-170-363-752; 039-783-700-856-256; 039-826-982-589-375; 040-556-870-598-232; 045-361-758-943-165; 048-396-540-107-454; 049-012-654-002-459; 052-204-219-278-033; 055-194-067-578-936; 055-389-748-286-883; 056-552-829-431-53X; 057-350-495-594-603; 063-200-724-104-457; 069-955-057-939-613; 074-273-534-252-025; 077-095-626-813-563; 078-668-160-251-766; 080-644-763-997-087; 084-213-185-304-701; 086-401-225-248-339; 090-274-688-300-629; 095-483-141-266-087; 096-060-950-250-01X; 100-840-528-972-746; 112-526-322-233-307; 117-195-131-259-49X; 123-396-326-487-052; 132-515-506-234-445; 136-148-913-703-29X; 136-752-283-858-000; 140-241-565-594-541; 140-242-669-526-644; 150-325-162-873-23X; 151-457-173-161-191; 160-061-737-284-265; 181-047-983-020-40X; 183-022-769-808-433,106

Social media listening (infoveillance) can not only monitor public attitudes on COVID-19 vaccines but also assess the dissemination of and public engagement with these opinions.; Objective: This study aims to assess global hesitancy, confidence, and public engagement toward COVID-19 vaccination.; Methods: We collected posts mentioning the COVID-19 vaccine between June and July 2020 on Twitter from New York (United States), London (United Kingdom), Mumbai (India), and Sao Paulo (Brazil), and Sina Weibo posts from Beijing (China). In total, we manually coded 12,886 posts from the five global metropolises with high COVID-19 burdens, and after assessment, 7032 posts were included in the analysis. We manually double-coded these posts using a coding framework developed according to the World Health Organization’s Confidence, Complacency, and Convenience model of vaccine hesitancy, and conducted engagement analysis to investigate public communication about COVID-19 vaccines on social media.; Results: Among social media users, 36.4% (571/1568) in New York, 51.3% (738/1440) in London, 67.3% (144/214) in Sao Paulo, 69.8% (726/1040) in Mumbai, and 76.8% (2128/2770) in Beijing indicated that they intended to accept a COVID-19 vaccination. With a high perceived risk of getting COVID-19, more tweeters in New York and London expressed a lack of confidence in vaccine safety, distrust in governments and experts, and widespread misinformation or rumors. Tweeters from Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Beijing worried more about vaccine production and supply, whereas tweeters from New York and London had more concerns about vaccine distribution and inequity. Negative tweets expressing lack of vaccine confidence and misinformation or rumors had more followers and attracted more public engagement online.; Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is prevalent worldwide, and negative tweets attract higher engagement on social media. It is urgent to develop an effective vaccine campaign that boosts public confidence and addresses hesitancy for COVID-19 vaccine rollouts.",23,6,e27632,,Public opinion; Political science; Public engagement; Vaccination; Misinformation; Beijing; Infoveillance; Infodemiology; Public relations; Social media,COVID-19; COVID-19 vaccine; acceptance; confidence; engagement; hesitancy; infodemiology; infoveillance; social media,COVID-19/drug therapy; COVID-19 Vaccines/pharmacology; Humans; Public Opinion; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media/standards,COVID-19 Vaccines,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/zh/covidwho-1249625 https://doi.org/10.2196/27632 https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/pt/covidwho-1249625 https://www.jmir.org/2021/6/e27632 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34061757 http://doi.org/10.2196/27632 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4662348/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34061757/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8202656 https://doaj.org/article/41881cac346f42dd851d578257547e77,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/27632,34061757,10.2196/27632,3131631110,PMC8202656,0,001-565-056-087-024; 004-335-733-417-031; 008-859-113-787-173; 016-147-395-122-325; 016-897-163-777-333; 018-357-150-180-47X; 018-439-946-902-473; 020-607-427-113-634; 021-826-317-684-782; 023-347-517-447-110; 023-897-237-567-798; 025-271-384-564-536; 031-769-455-215-719; 033-389-281-394-208; 036-793-856-327-940; 042-594-042-910-067; 045-606-961-192-742; 051-968-214-813-360; 053-476-812-647-640; 053-681-455-441-048; 053-811-746-715-187; 061-324-327-187-043; 066-126-995-957-562; 066-460-782-162-081; 069-306-040-093-164; 069-796-190-534-919; 072-201-632-719-13X; 082-042-044-371-576; 114-431-428-638-901; 114-849-017-223-291; 143-187-835-661-164; 155-449-661-187-492; 156-850-542-689-323; 174-391-419-686-672,16

Kendall,"Background: Anxiety disorders in children and young people are common and bring significant personal and societal costs. Over the last two decades, there has been a substantial increase in research evaluating psychological and pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people and exciting and novel research has continued as the field strives to improve efficacy and effectiveness, and accessibility of interventions. This increase in research brings potential to draw together data across studies to compare treatment approaches and advance understanding of what works, how, and for whom. There are challenges to these efforts due largely to variation in studies’ outcome measures and variation in the way study characteristics are reported, making it difficult to compare and/or combine studies, and this is likely to lead to faulty conclusions. Studies particularly vary in their reliance on child, parent, and/or assessor-based ratings across a range of outcomes, including remission of anxiety diagnosis, symptom reduction, and other domains of functioning (e.g., family relationships, peer relationships). Methods: To address these challenges, we convened a series of international activities that brought together the views of key stakeholders (i.e., researchers, mental health professionals, young people, parents/caregivers) to develop recommendations for outcome measurement to be used in treatment trials for anxiety disorders in children and young people. Results and Conclusions: This article reports the results of these activities and offers recommendations for selection and reporting of outcome measures to (a) guide future research and (b) improve communication of what has been measured and reported. We offer these recommendations to promote international consistency in trial reporting and to enable the field to take full advantage of the great opportunities that come from data sharing going forward.",62,3,255,269,Mental health; Peer review; Psychology; Consistency (negotiation); Psychological intervention; Statement (logic); Data sharing; Child and adolescent; Anxiety; Clinical psychology,Anxiety; treatment trials,Adolescent; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders/therapy; Child; Consensus; Family; Humans; Parents,,Department of Health (RP_2014-04-018) United Kingdom,https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/publications/1123452 https://www.researchwithrutgers.com/en/publications/research-review-recommendations-for-reporting-on-treatment-trials https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32683742 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/129020 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/129020/Repub_129020_O-A.pdf https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:3352fab https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/publications/1123452 http://eprints.usq.edu.au/39250/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32683742 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32683742/ https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/research-review-recommendations-for-reporting-on-treatment-trials https://eprints.usq.edu.au/39250/ https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/publications/research-review(bb0171a7-a432-455d-9983-c1da34bc4e2d).html https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/62054886/jcpp.13283.pdf https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/395738 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/1123452 https://dare.uva.nl/search?identifier=e04d016a-37a9-41b0-8e9c-91e8d65f3bc0 https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13283 https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jcpp.13283 https://bora.uib.no/bora-xmlui/handle/11250/2730907 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adare.uva.nl%3Apublications%2Fe04d016a-37a9-41b0-8e9c-91e8d65f3bc0 https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/research-review-recommendations-for-reporting-on-treatment-trials https://core.ac.uk/download/335013322.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13283,32683742,10.1111/jcpp.13283,3042257983,,0,000-422-378-289-265; 002-874-936-802-239; 003-062-449-216-462; 003-445-109-122-433; 005-528-216-380-637; 006-936-762-524-537; 008-376-549-849-199; 009-065-562-127-594; 009-376-550-197-729; 009-416-056-595-493; 010-088-663-461-556; 013-388-747-409-054; 013-912-249-795-974; 014-120-577-645-183; 014-326-302-881-404; 016-132-949-554-444; 017-587-389-852-140; 017-599-242-384-555; 018-030-144-398-363; 018-036-046-308-632; 018-129-947-433-206; 019-256-076-831-409; 019-863-994-315-82X; 023-937-239-556-674; 024-623-320-951-932; 026-350-782-132-327; 028-554-816-178-700; 030-110-484-217-586; 031-253-933-176-391; 031-409-796-613-468; 031-477-520-335-473; 032-611-781-681-172; 033-052-398-933-902; 036-938-437-218-023; 038-842-696-567-347; 039-560-825-121-212; 040-959-521-005-052; 042-545-859-615-58X; 045-315-872-345-890; 048-440-021-399-884; 049-177-887-730-348; 053-911-515-643-292; 054-059-978-501-990; 054-366-027-359-116; 055-242-276-027-245; 056-191-980-653-986; 057-823-642-669-167; 063-348-869-315-715; 064-020-598-610-84X; 064-583-259-370-49X; 073-484-311-107-49X; 073-576-267-902-725; 076-748-693-150-797; 079-499-572-036-511; 083-831-959-711-725; 083-997-985-205-009; 084-865-659-660-155; 085-806-732-125-009; 088-025-801-314-311; 089-842-595-138-383; 089-931-387-275-724; 092-111-729-714-550; 102-468-978-381-008; 106-363-899-676-558; 106-443-420-881-833; 106-837-499-952-914; 107-566-024-671-38X; 107-964-064-185-849; 109-746-560-421-940; 110-699-313-561-459; 118-504-409-391-333; 119-172-438-670-778; 132-768-138-453-032; 134-292-424-445-721; 138-186-775-116-336; 148-106-175-424-132; 152-385-360-736-997; 164-096-537-527-256; 174-467-797-008-199,19

In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, Malaria Consortium adapted its SMC delivery model to ensure safety of distributors, data collectors and beneficiaries. We conducted a SMC monitoring survey in July 2020 in the states of Bauchi, Jigawa, Kano, Katsina, Sokoto and Yobe, with questions on COVID-19 prevention behaviours and symptoms, and belief in misinformation. We investigated the associations between receipt of information on COVID-19 by different sources, including from SMC distributors, and these three outcomes using logistic generalised estimating equations. We also considered moderation of effectiveness of message delivery by SMC distributors and adherence to use of face coverings. We obtained a representative sample of 40,157 caregivers of eligible children aged 3–59 months, of which 36,914 (91.92%) reported knowledge of COVID-19. The weighted proportions of respondents who correctly identified COVID-19 prevention behaviours and symptoms, and who reported belief in COVID-19 misinformation, were 80.52% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 80.02–81.00), 81.72% (95% CI 81.23–82.20) and 22.90% (95% CI 22.24–23.57). Receipt of information on COVID-19 from SMC distributors during the campaign was significantly associated with higher odds of caregiver knowledge of COVID-19 prevention behaviours (odds ratio [OR] 1.78, 95% CI 1.64–1.94, p < 0.001) and symptoms (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.59–1.90, p < 0.001) and lower odds of belief in COVID-19 misinformation (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85–1.00, p = 0.038). The associations between message delivery by SMC distributors and the three outcomes were moderated by their adherence to face covering use. Receipt of information by other sources used to deliver government public health messages, including radio and health facility workers, was also associated with knowledge of COVID-19. Malaria Consortium’s SMC programme was successfully adapted in the context of COVID-19 and was a conduit for high-quality public health messages. Standard SMC monitoring and evaluation activities can be adapted to gather evidence on emerging public health issues such as the global COVID-19 pandemic.",48,1,1,8,Public health; Odds; Odds ratio; Health facility; Misinformation; Malaria; Receipt; Context (language use); Medicine; Environmental health,COVID-19; Community health workers; Infodemics; Nigeria; Public health campaigns; Seasonal malaria chemoprevention,,,"UK aid; Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317640 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs41182-020-00288-7 https://tropmedhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41182-020-00288-7 https://www.scilit.net/article/de4d7916a084494956f7cec42d43adc4 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s41182-020-00288-7.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7734461 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7734461 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33317640/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41182-020-00288-7,33317640,10.1186/s41182-020-00288-7,3112655751,PMC7734461,0,001-135-895-578-764; 001-286-771-333-798; 001-856-932-437-291; 024-073-065-942-620; 025-913-263-109-424; 026-105-789-784-919; 029-930-188-233-926; 031-909-942-803-894; 047-449-738-480-502; 051-050-666-333-721; 055-453-889-183-515; 067-631-129-799-549; 075-731-761-310-100; 082-847-920-931-181; 107-745-770-761-890; 121-944-606-319-581; 148-868-419-299-720,2

Previous research suggests that despite the significant resources which go into collecting data for national clinical audits, the information they contain is not always used effectively to improve local services. Methods and analysis We will conduct a formative process evaluation of PQIP comprising a multisited qualitative study to analyse PQIP’s programme theory, barriers, facilitators and wider contextual factors that influence implementation. The research will be carried out with the PQIP project team and six National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England, selected according to geographical location, type of hospital, size and level of engagement with PQIP. We will include one Trust which has not expressed interest in the PQIP for comparison and to explore the role of secular trend in any changes in practice. We will use semi-structured interviews (up to 144 in Trusts and 12 with the project team), non-participant observations (up to 150  hours) and documentary analysis. We will track the lifecycle of perioperative data, exploring the transformations it undergoes from creation to use. We will use framework analysis with categories both from our research questions and from themes emerging from the data. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted from the University College London Research Ethics Committee (ref 10375/001). Permissions to conduct research at NHS Trusts have been granted by local Research and Development offices in coordination with the Health Research Authority. We will follow guidelines for data security, confidentiality and information governance. Findings will be shared at regular time points with the PQIP project team to inform the implementation of the programme, and with participating NHS Trusts to help them reflect on how they currently use data for improvement of perioperative services.",9,7,e030214,,Research ethics; Information governance; Qualitative research; Audit; Clinical audit; Project team; Health services research; Formative assessment; Medical education; Medicine,anaesthetics; clinical audit; health services research; perioperative; qualitative research; quality improvement,"Elective Surgical Procedures/standards; Humans; Perioperative Care/standards; Process Assessment, Health Care/methods; Qualitative Research; Quality Improvement; State Medicine/standards",,The Health Foundation; Royal College Of Anaesthetists,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31296515/ https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/7/e030214 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6624057 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/7/e030214.citation-tools https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10077931/ http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10077931/ https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/7/e030214.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030214,31296515,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030214,2956581901,PMC6624057,0,000-145-523-689-087; 000-598-971-468-888; 007-562-452-184-146; 008-271-422-452-193; 008-686-917-140-778; 008-938-284-624-550; 017-604-045-243-423; 017-725-125-221-612; 018-287-950-546-483; 019-085-709-290-515; 020-840-857-064-976; 021-134-237-884-840; 028-118-334-271-792; 035-471-784-572-34X; 036-443-860-830-266; 037-587-576-884-32X; 040-967-305-686-922; 041-118-966-344-41X; 043-792-491-404-921; 045-457-306-581-657; 047-782-012-899-135; 062-145-194-127-436; 122-872-065-590-93X; 136-626-329-666-18X; 149-709-263-946-327; 178-295-149-423-586; 185-877-393-392-340,2

These challenges are accentuated in underserved patient populations across Europe, who are less likely to receive quality healthcare for reasons including socioeconomic inequalities, educational or cultural status, or geographic location. While there are many local and national initiatives targeted to address these challenges, there remains a need to reduce disparities and improve access to healthcare to improve outcomes, with a focus on multidisciplinary stakeholder engagement. In October 2019, a range of experts in metastatic breast cancer, including healthcare professionals, patient representatives, policymakers and politicians, met to discuss and prioritize the critical needs of underserved patient populations with metastatic breast cancer in Europe. Six key challenges faced by these communities were identified: the need for amplification of the metastatic breast cancer patient voice, better and wider implementation of high-quality guidelines for metastatic breast cancer, more collaboration between stakeholders, tailored support for patients from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds, improved data sharing, and work-related issues. The Expert Panel then conceived and discussed potential actionable goals to address each key challenge. Their conclusions present a set of interrelated approaches to address the different challenges and could serve as the basis for concerted improvement of the lives of patients with metastatic breast cancer in Europe.",55,,79,90,Cancer; Ethnic group; Health care; Multidisciplinary approach; Metastatic breast cancer; Data sharing; Stakeholder engagement; Family medicine; Location; Medicine,Cancer care disparities; Challenges; Europe; Metastatic breast cancer; Oncology; Underserved patient population,Breast Neoplasms/therapy; Ethnicity; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Medically Underserved Area; Patient Advocacy; Vulnerable Populations,,Pfizer,https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/addressing-disparities-and-challenges-in-underserved-patient-popu https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960977620302411 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03391070v1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7772562 https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3115604/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33360479/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960977620302411 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33360479 https://researchportal.vub.be/en/publications/addressing-disparities-and-challenges-in-underserved-patient-popu,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.breast.2020.12.005,33360479,10.1016/j.breast.2020.12.005,3112577463,PMC7772562,0,002-592-669-000-542; 003-801-882-338-205; 004-326-735-834-192; 005-149-149-791-54X; 005-279-745-479-582; 005-387-284-508-501; 005-748-884-366-27X; 006-003-294-274-308; 007-076-243-766-189; 007-453-364-035-383; 009-108-179-471-672; 011-018-381-201-484; 013-601-510-774-328; 015-532-862-908-496; 016-190-122-364-744; 016-697-146-941-30X; 018-844-596-869-202; 022-712-572-832-499; 026-220-600-050-836; 027-495-969-199-832; 028-002-785-048-739; 028-866-949-327-127; 029-859-803-094-421; 030-703-348-708-19X; 032-333-692-114-232; 032-580-863-473-415; 033-858-086-712-572; 033-904-314-970-528; 034-397-167-722-833; 036-455-362-988-704; 036-560-614-179-044; 043-683-737-835-260; 044-051-851-742-755; 044-409-270-818-209; 045-919-018-615-65X; 046-734-900-389-077; 049-116-019-287-447; 051-306-917-733-68X; 055-960-516-212-068; 061-334-732-085-701; 063-121-307-525-474; 066-985-646-181-351; 069-149-769-627-187; 071-537-169-339-073; 077-792-701-063-058; 078-466-710-572-084; 079-189-342-233-938; 084-599-446-897-491; 088-429-750-720-029; 089-449-265-382-542; 092-997-995-439-892; 094-979-597-211-239; 100-096-294-662-338; 102-284-655-230-858; 105-088-601-169-44X; 108-340-618-175-29X; 128-239-304-700-484; 134-261-940-073-459; 135-984-918-812-118; 154-399-282-361-201; 158-276-043-999-617,3

Tabrizi; Simon Mead,"Techniques for clinical genetic testing in dementia disorders have advanced rapidly but remain to be more widely implemented in practice. A positive genetic test offers a precise molecular diagnosis, can help members of an affected family to determine personal risk, provides a basis for reproductive choices and can offer options for clinical trials. The likelihood of identifying a specific genetic cause of dementia depends on the clinical condition, the age at onset and family history. Attempts to match phenotypes to single genes are mostly inadvisable owing to clinical overlap between the dementias, genetic heterogeneity, pleiotropy and concurrent mutations. Currently, the appropriate genetic test in most cases of dementia is a next-generation sequencing gene panel, though some conditions necessitate specific types of test such as repeat expansion testing. Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming financially feasible but raise or exacerbate complex issues such as variants of uncertain significance, secondary findings and the potential for re-analysis in light of new information. However, the capacity for data analysis and counselling is already restricting the provision of genetic testing. Patients and their relatives need to be given reliable information to enable them to make informed choices about tests, treatments and data sharing; the ability of patients with dementia to make decisions must be considered when providing this information.",17,1,23,36,Intensive care medicine; Test (assessment); Pleiotropy (drugs); Dementia; Data sharing; Genetic testing; Family history; Clinical trial; Genetic heterogeneity; Medicine,,Age of Onset; Dementia/diagnosis; Genetic Testing; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Mutation; Phenotype,,Medical Research Council (MC_U123160651) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_00024/1) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33168964 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33168964 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10115001/ https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-020-00416-1.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-020-00416-1 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33168964/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41582-020-00416-1,33168964,10.1038/s41582-020-00416-1,3098608045,,0,000-296-632-933-454; 000-312-509-616-477; 000-393-830-572-658; 000-955-560-198-919; 001-715-385-966-039; 002-680-285-370-624; 002-885-349-701-939; 002-950-940-373-360; 003-992-453-103-613; 004-207-356-313-045; 004-512-245-055-689; 005-372-751-406-757; 006-575-140-584-411; 006-868-771-184-683; 007-058-850-417-870; 007-589-901-822-618; 007-655-528-726-638; 009-391-791-182-566; 009-628-538-511-12X; 009-995-008-408-883; 010-190-225-775-177; 011-794-559-743-750; 011-995-886-405-709; 012-633-930-578-120; 012-642-774-237-838; 013-147-484-747-715; 013-512-621-006-044; 014-069-408-450-085; 014-800-804-768-722; 014-847-048-741-599; 015-243-035-231-214; 015-307-411-123-672; 015-337-152-082-964; 016-255-699-349-236; 016-694-714-153-210; 016-781-011-490-187; 017-503-077-324-145; 017-700-323-933-812; 018-174-334-279-78X; 019-228-744-115-70X; 019-583-853-520-161; 019-790-337-868-50X; 020-439-430-668-665; 020-662-245-933-780; 020-834-525-876-846; 021-261-217-032-271; 021-663-272-000-928; 022-051-535-507-288; 022-076-390-491-908; 022-562-553-144-606; 023-043-266-169-407; 023-380-288-288-834; 024-051-701-812-919; 024-970-046-926-182; 025-097-602-441-913; 025-183-536-814-224; 026-083-996-425-949; 026-129-645-699-551; 026-411-727-776-863; 026-496-588-020-761; 026-677-184-591-51X; 027-318-373-994-483; 028-063-375-307-063; 028-452-491-076-775; 028-810-179-127-600; 028-937-991-151-802; 030-441-228-889-320; 031-933-456-538-28X; 032-479-671-868-467; 034-370-423-320-738; 035-096-386-640-237; 035-431-425-287-700; 035-846-740-268-010; 036-204-068-305-777; 036-236-363-062-794; 036-905-035-073-297; 036-929-890-343-530; 036-953-033-304-326; 038-299-547-798-879; 039-486-278-041-076; 040-824-325-494-284; 041-444-593-245-243; 041-677-211-883-029; 043-076-276-989-114; 044-295-260-055-049; 045-030-359-832-410; 045-467-255-861-294; 045-613-896-389-439; 049-143-602-604-650; 049-235-085-290-136; 049-318-585-802-760; 049-712-487-540-985; 049-806-901-803-662; 049-861-456-554-080; 052-503-192-248-183; 053-227-366-847-29X; 053-467-482-214-978; 054-601-567-238-988; 055-657-802-750-463; 057-096-253-990-426; 057-390-494-663-28X; 058-164-814-832-507; 059-105-057-315-049; 063-680-194-226-312; 063-991-004-452-975; 064-251-267-480-76X; 064-619-711-671-435; 066-728-253-790-909; 066-945-548-365-329; 067-744-467-838-927; 067-759-921-168-233; 068-733-354-484-635; 070-279-587-596-78X; 070-281-453-573-788; 071-290-737-664-99X; 071-944-322-940-120; 072-321-546-395-147; 074-970-684-325-035; 075-391-979-445-94X; 077-037-372-984-497; 077-166-454-707-347; 077-303-778-620-561; 078-550-102-212-335; 083-930-721-032-240; 086-267-013-181-561; 086-632-035-133-010; 090-527-051-650-624; 092-198-580-304-194; 092-855-020-194-158; 093-268-452-518-38X; 096-717-282-504-451; 097-084-574-636-818; 097-459-598-058-141; 104-262-378-350-338; 107-321-531-352-783; 110-025-643-623-260; 117-923-926-338-215; 118-634-989-511-877; 119-240-539-773-866; 120-653-063-587-267; 124-320-510-452-445; 125-047-652-537-550; 127-016-670-476-238; 128-961-873-336-158; 129-613-448-093-461; 130-182-684-597-315; 131-393-308-662-220; 135-834-461-983-553; 137-376-879-404-405; 139-182-641-367-461; 139-449-151-428-401; 139-569-872-510-655; 140-789-503-787-173; 144-806-005-283-316; 144-971-026-481-652; 148-164-098-524-046; 156-700-745-961-928,6

A national tri-partite delivery framework involving the Department of Health, NHS England and Public Health England was agreed and a new local operational model applied. Evidence about how health system re-organisations affect constituent public health programmes is sparse and focused on low and middle income countries. We conducted an in-depth analysis of how the English immunisation programme adapted to the April 2013 health system reorganisation, and what facilitated or hindered the delivery of immunisation services in this context. Methods A qualitative case study methodology involving interviews and observations at national and local level was applied. Three sites were selected to represent different localities, varying levels of immunisation coverage and a range of changes in governance. Study participants included 19 national decision-makers and 56 local implementers. Two rounds of interviews and observations (immunisation board/committee meetings) occurred between December 2014 and June 2015, and September and December 2015. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim and written accounts of observed events compiled. Data was imported into NVIVO 10 and analysed thematically. Results The new immunisation programme in the new health system was described as fragmented, and significant effort was expended to regroup. National tripartite arrangements required joint working and accountability; a shift from the simpler hierarchical pre-reform structure, typical of many public health programmes. New local inter-organisational arrangements resulted in ambiguity about organisational responsibilities and hindered data-sharing. Whilst making immunisation managers responsible for larger areas supported equitable resource distribution and strengthened service commissioning, it also reduced their ability to apply clinical expertise, support and evaluate immunisation providers’ performance. Partnership working helped staff adapt, but the complexity of the health system hindered the development of consistent approaches for training and service evaluation. Conclusion The April 2013 health system reorganisation in England resulted in significant fragmentation in the way the immunisation programme was delivered. Some of this was a temporary by-product of organisational change, other more persistent challenges were intrinsic to the complex architecture of the new health system. Partnership working helped immunisation leaders and implementers reconnect and now the challenge is to assess how inter-agency collaboration can be strengthened.",16,1,489,489,Health administration; Public health; Health informatics; Nursing; Project commissioning; Qualitative research; Accountability; Context (language use); Public relations; Nursing research; Medicine,Delivery of health services; Health reforms; Immunisation; Organisational change; Public health; Qualitative research,Cooperative Behavior; Delivery of Health Care/organization & administration; England; Government Programs; Health Care Reform/organization & administration; Humans; Immunization Programs/organization & administration; Interinstitutional Relations; Organizational Innovation; Program Evaluation; Public Health/standards; Qualitative Research; Quality of Health Care; State Medicine/organization & administration,,National Institute for Health Research,https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5025625 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12913-016-1711-0 https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-016-1711-0 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27633653/ https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/2901217 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12913-016-1711-0.pdf https://0-bmchealthservres-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/s12913-016-1711-0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27633653 http://datacompass.lshtm.ac.uk/278/ https://core.ac.uk/download/46556924.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12913-016-1711-0,27633653,10.1186/s12913-016-1711-0,2519189872,PMC5025625,0,003-398-511-416-22X; 006-157-457-761-787; 009-476-861-576-126; 010-761-290-262-147; 014-396-147-522-922; 018-942-611-241-448; 020-003-127-671-741; 025-179-088-034-90X; 027-070-112-879-480; 030-469-476-608-473; 034-791-769-367-918; 036-523-463-917-712; 055-498-815-134-39X; 076-507-005-129-592; 082-578-462-132-40X; 085-284-086-026-632; 085-793-347-127-702; 090-537-929-682-00X; 091-134-617-480-476; 091-908-616-631-013; 103-307-775-332-993; 115-990-313-124-326; 124-868-979-149-375; 128-519-086-015-927; 134-351-030-335-316; 154-479-252-007-48X; 181-083-079-849-912,10

Bernard Heymann; José María Carazo,"Three-dimensional electron microscopy (3DEM) of ice-embedded samples allows the structural analysis of large biological macromolecules close to their native state. Different techniques have been developed during the last forty years to process cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data. Not surprisingly, success in analysis and interpretation is highly correlated with the continuous development of image processing packages. The field has matured to the point where further progress in data and methods sharing depends on an agreement between the packages on how to describe common image processing tasks. Such standardization will facilitate the use of software as well as seamless collaboration, allowing the sharing of rich information between different platforms. Our aim here is to describe the Electron Microscopy eXchange (EMX) initiative, launched at the 2012 Instruct Image Processing Center Developer Workshop, with the intention of developing a first set of standard conventions for the interchange of information for single-particle analysis (EMX version 1.0).

L. Ho; Teck Chuan Voo,"Background: The development of biobanks is associated with the emergence of new ethical challenges. In Egypt, several biobanks have been established, but there are no specific local ethical guidelines to guide their work. The aim of this study is to develop recommendations for the Egyptian human biobanking ethical guidelines, which take into consideration the specific cultural and legal framework in Egypt. Methods: We searched the literature for available biobanking ethical guidelines. Six themes were the concern of search, namely; informed consent, data protection, return of results, sharing of samples and data, community engagement, and stakeholder engagement. If a document refers to another guideline, the new source is identified and the previous step is repeated. Results: Ten documents were identified, which were analyzed for the themes mentioned above. Guidelines and best practices were identified, and then compared with the published documents about ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) related to biomedical research in Egypt to reach best recommendations. Conclusions: We have proposed, by way of recommendations, key characteristics that a national ethics framework in Egypt could have. On informed consent, the practice of broad consent may be harmonized among biobanks in Egypt. Clear policies on return of research results, training requirements and availability of genetic counseling could also be instituted through the national framework. Additionally, such a framework should facilitate community and stakeholders engagement, which is important to secure trust and build consensus on contentious issues arising from sample and data sharing across borders and commercialization, among other concerns.",6,,4,4,Biobank; Political science; Best practice; Community engagement; Data sharing; Return of results; Stakeholder engagement; Engineering ethics; Informed consent; Data Protection Act 1998,Biobanking; Egypt; Ethical guidelines; Informed consent; data sharing,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-4 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-4/v1/xml https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8008429/ https://doaj.org/article/d82037d42ba2436fbf391a6f0d152915 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-4/v2/pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33824911,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16556.2,33824911,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16556.2,3118759668,PMC8008429,0,001-274-029-077-285; 006-991-949-353-784; 011-139-667-669-980; 013-921-342-529-704; 015-927-518-862-958; 025-905-539-042-903; 027-136-287-056-653; 029-255-140-596-81X; 029-736-800-477-718; 031-008-949-513-496; 032-139-212-821-167; 035-205-782-118-061; 037-312-823-596-489; 038-867-733-306-21X; 052-808-702-137-748; 057-956-911-366-471; 058-744-219-779-087; 061-852-202-501-106; 064-329-730-588-13X; 065-160-692-055-927; 068-529-936-570-21X; 069-313-316-285-614; 086-341-889-989-736; 091-343-504-987-714; 097-180-068-382-19X; 103-635-177-386-329; 109-895-401-678-262; 143-260-141-200-628; 155-135-498-642-296; 170-390-080-551-145,0

Failing to correct this misreporting introduces biases and it may lead to misinformed decision making. Our work provides methods of correcting for this bias, by reinterpreting it as a missing data problem, and particularly learning from positive and unlabelled data. Focusing on information theoretic approaches we have three key contributions: (1) we provide a method to perform valid independence tests with known power by incorporating prior knowledge over misreporting; (2) we derive corrections for point/interval estimates of the mutual information that capture both relevance and redundancy; and finally, (3) we derive different ways for ranking under-reported risk factors.

A recurrent problem in hydrology is the absence of streamflow data to calibrate rainfall–runoff models. A commonly used approach in such circumstances conditions model parameters on regionalized response signatures. While several different signatures are often available to be included in this process, an outstanding challenge is the selection of signatures that provide useful and complementary information. Different signatures do not necessarily provide independent information and this has led to signatures being omitted or included on a subjective basis. This paper presents a method that accounts for the inter-signature error correlation structure so that regional information is neither neglected nor double-counted when multiple signatures are included. Using 84 catchments from the MOPEX database, observed signatures are regressed against physical and climatic catchment attributes. The derived relationships are then utilized to assess the joint probability distribution of the signature regionalization errors that is subsequently used in a Bayesian procedure to condition a rainfall–runoff model. The results show that the consideration of the inter-signature error structure may improve predictions when the error correlations are strong. However, other uncertainties such as model structure and observational error may outweigh the importance of these correlations. Further, these other uncertainties cause some signatures to appear repeatedly to be misinformative.",20,2,887,901,Bayesian probability; Correlation; Data mining; Basis (linear algebra); Signature (logic); Joint probability distribution; Structure (mathematical logic); Observational error; Computer science; Streamflow,,,,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; Natural Environment Research Council,http://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/32460/3/Accounting%20for%20dependencies%20in%20regionalized%20signatures.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/89612952 https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:382072 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016HESS...20..887A/abstract https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/20/887/2016/ https://doaj.org/article/bfbe401c15364356ad899a9ce6d0c2ea http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/20/887/2016/ https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/accounting-for-dependencies-in-regionalized-signatures-for-predictions-in-ungauged-catchments(da590638-86a3-468f-9c02-9f6293ef2128).html https://noa.gwlb.de/receive/cop_mods_00013963 http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/68273309/hess_20_887_2016.pdf https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/68273309/hess_20_887_2016.pdf https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/20/887/2016/hess-20-887-2016.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-887-2016,,10.5194/hess-20-887-2016,2276007906,,0,002-428-087-460-392; 003-469-944-303-031; 004-829-578-394-190; 010-983-326-766-560; 011-748-858-674-217; 011-842-702-109-562; 012-777-072-415-570; 014-295-334-190-211; 015-332-580-805-53X; 016-800-203-792-949; 019-202-722-756-156; 020-038-944-422-198; 020-063-052-135-083; 026-988-707-842-401; 028-153-824-529-26X; 029-732-909-576-906; 030-396-727-146-919; 035-891-161-052-955; 037-605-147-256-006; 040-546-856-378-525; 040-704-244-112-743; 044-352-033-448-027; 050-554-379-652-570; 051-006-815-865-855; 058-468-253-734-247; 060-570-941-481-59X; 060-862-473-576-612; 066-395-091-336-427; 066-947-210-171-825; 080-356-725-298-553; 081-459-434-237-820; 083-452-766-886-991; 086-248-445-506-477; 087-302-963-041-965; 088-092-824-643-951; 090-787-506-584-75X; 091-220-041-806-330; 092-101-881-965-179; 092-932-817-413-369; 104-353-451-495-263; 105-576-514-339-028; 106-118-473-571-071; 106-183-642-486-304; 108-227-856-010-154; 110-740-017-391-995; 110-929-948-369-269; 127-170-924-918-397; 127-601-800-995-747; 132-778-056-100-195; 139-976-479-277-744; 142-949-864-996-918; 147-840-143-400-873; 161-516-093-829-93X; 165-787-563-269-27X; 168-888-939-226-270; 173-093-318-251-424; 181-648-893-047-370; 191-506-012-523-859; 199-264-763-810-711,13

Methods include 46 semi-structured interviews, primarily with health professionals and technology developers, ethnographic observation and document analysis. Drawing on an empirically informed understanding of privacy as 'articulation work', we focus on the indeterminate nature of information privacy practices and examine the work required to translate privacy, from a normative professional duty to an enacted medical practice. This analysis also highlights the invisibility of privacy practices and their coordinating role in delivering technologically-supported medical care.

Through the development of dialogue tools, indoor localization and physical activity tracking sensors, BESiDE is taking steps towards enhancing understanding of accessibility within the design of care home environments. Focused on initial reflections from contemporary design practice, we have found that, design guidance; a lack of research 'tools' to engage with users; an absent research culture; and missing elements of design training, are factors preventing a designer's holistic engagement with the experiences of older people and technologies within the built environment. In addition to reviewing these findings, an overview of BESiDE'S continuing work and methods planned for assessing the accessibility within older peoples' care environments is discussed.",110,110,17,25,Sociology; Built environment; Work (electrical); Digital economy; Tracking (education); Context (language use); Care environments; Older people; Design elements and principles; Knowledge management,,,,Research Councils UK,https://doi.org/10.1145/2670962.2670965 https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2670962.2670965,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2670962.2670965,,10.1145/2670962.2670965,2040417343,,0,001-440-279-794-229; 007-105-512-073-496; 010-288-539-617-37X; 045-462-392-722-757; 068-174-684-921-983; 093-890-843-606-408; 105-049-034-467-691; 108-418-916-251-817; 112-238-313-124-241; 127-729-219-024-309; 129-221-771-266-403; 157-753-987-807-339; 164-491-636-528-799; 189-709-151-713-570,0

At diagnosis, the mean total ESSDAI score was 6.1; 81.8% of patients had systemic activity (ESSDAI score ≥1). Males had a higher mean ESSDAI (8.1 vs 6.0, P 65 years, P < 0.001). The highest global ESSDAI score was reported in Black/African Americans, followed by White, Asian and Hispanic patients (6.7, 6.5, 5.4 and 4.8, respectively; P < 0.001). The frequency of involvement of each systemic organ also differed between ethnic groups, with Black/African American patients showing the highest frequencies in the lymphadenopathy, articular, peripheral nervous system, CNS and biological domains, White patients in the glandular, cutaneous and muscular domains, Asian patients in the pulmonary, renal and haematological domains and Hispanic patients in the constitutional domain. Systemic activity measured by the ESSDAI, clinical ESSDAI (clinESSDAI) and disease activity states was higher in patients from southern countries (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: The systemic phenotype of primary Sjogren's syndrome is strongly influenced by personal determinants such as age, gender, ethnicity and place of residence, which are key geoepidemiological players in driving the expression of systemic disease at diagnosis.

Ashley; Nandini Shetty; Jean B. Patel; Rogier van Doorn; Direk Limmathurotsakul; Nicholas A. Feasey; Iruka N. Okeke; Sharon J. Peacock,"One of the most pressing challenges facing the global surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the generation, sharing, systematic analysis and dissemination of data in low-resource settings. Numerous agencies and initiatives are working to support the development of globally distributed microbiology capacity, but the routine generation of a sustainable flow of reliable data will take time to establish before it can deliver a clinical and public health impact. By contrast, there are a large number of pharma- and academia-led initiatives that have generated a wealth of data on AMR and drug-resistant infections in low-resource settings, together with high-volume data generation by private laboratories. Here, we explore how untapped sources of data could provide a short-term solution that bridges the gap between now and the time when routine surveillance capacity will have been established and how this could continue to support surveillance efforts in the future. We discuss the benefits and limitations of data generated by these sources, the mechanisms and barriers to making this accessible and how academia and pharma might support the development of laboratory and analytical capacity. We provide key actions that will be required to harness these data, including: a mapping exercise; creating mechanisms for data sharing; use of data to support national action plans; facilitating access to and use of data by the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System; and innovation in data capture, analysis and sharing.",74,3,541,546,Automatic identification and data capture; Business; Key (cryptography); Data science; Data sharing; Academia (organization); Low resource; Test data generation,,"Developing Countries; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Epidemiological Monitoring; Global Health; Health Resources; Humans",,Wellcome Drug Resistant Infection Priority Programme,https://academic.oup.com/jac/article-abstract/74/3/541/5245301 http://academic.oup.com/jac/article-abstract/74/3/541/5245301 https://paperity.org/p/191770481/harnessing-alternative-sources-of-antimicrobial-resistance-data-to-support-surveillance https://researchportal.ukhsa.gov.uk/en/publications/harnessing-alternative-sources-of-antimicrobial-resistance-data-t https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/952852 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/288766 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30544186 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6406030/ https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4650113/ https://core.ac.uk/download/161939013.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jac/dky487,30544186,10.1093/jac/dky487,2906506328,PMC6406030,0,001-945-722-499-990; 011-701-458-114-108; 012-813-308-563-664; 014-998-066-795-628; 015-533-789-765-808; 018-241-259-131-968; 023-097-073-292-349; 026-805-523-706-080; 032-520-030-950-067; 041-310-724-857-538; 047-415-190-102-016; 067-003-844-339-341; 078-458-044-056-597; 083-446-426-624-134; 142-528-663-162-831,12

E Hanin; Kevin Queenan; Sara Savić; Esron D. Karimuribo; Simon R. Rüegg; Barbara Häsler,"Rooted in the recognition that emerging infectious diseases occur at the interface of human, animal, and ecosystem health, the Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS) initiative aims to promote a trans-sectoral approach to address better infectious disease risk management in five countries of the Southern African Development Community. Nine years after SACIDS’ inception, this study aimed to evaluate the program by applying a One Health (OH) evaluation framework developed by the Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH). The evaluation included a description of the context and the initiative, illustration of the theory of change, identification of outputs and outcomes, and assessment of the One Healthness. The latter is the sum of characteristics that defines an integrated approach and includes OH thinking, OH planning, OH working, sharing infrastructure, learning infrastructure, and systemic organization. The protocols made available by NEOH were used to develop data collection protocols and identify the study design. The framework relies on a mixed methods approach by combining a descriptive and qualitative assessment with a semi-quantitative evaluation (scoring). Data for the analysis were gathered during a document review, in group and individual interviews and in an online survey. Operational aspects (i.e., OH thinking, planning, and working) were found to be balanced overall with the highest score in the planning dimension, whereas the infrastructure (learning infrastructure, systemic organization, and sharing infrastructure) was high for the first two dimensions, but low for sharing. The OH index calculated was 0.359, and the OH ratio calculated was 1.495. The program was praised for its great innovative energy in a difficult landscape dominated by poor infrastructure and its ability to create awareness for OH and enthuse people for the concept; training of people and networking. Shortcomings were identified regarding the balance of contributions, funds and activities across member countries in the South, lack of data sharing, unequal allocation of resources, top-down management structures, and limited horizontal collaboration. Despite these challenges, SACIDS is perceived to be an effective agent in tackling infectious diseases in an integrated manner.",5,33,33,33,Data collection; Ecosystem health; Data sharing; One Health; Integrated approach; Risk management; Infectious disease (medical specialty); Knowledge management; Theory of change,One Health; Southern African Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance; capacity; evaluation; surveillance,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00033/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29616227 https://researchonline.rvc.ac.uk/id/eprint/11520/ https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/150338/1/fvets-05-00033.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/159106431 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fvets.2018.00033/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00033/pdf https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/150338/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5864892 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29616227 https://core.ac.uk/download/159106431.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2018.00033,29616227,10.3389/fvets.2018.00033,2791055979,PMC5864892,0,000-279-895-173-00X; 000-412-221-309-054; 005-027-099-637-505; 007-091-251-090-129; 012-266-504-749-941; 016-854-628-155-463; 018-607-290-899-75X; 018-608-335-080-807; 020-425-537-898-535; 021-100-348-412-20X; 021-734-387-125-46X; 043-823-233-840-084; 051-275-682-667-745; 052-856-687-640-324; 054-060-313-651-79X; 055-410-732-276-30X; 059-346-147-966-694; 059-610-325-691-700; 060-533-264-819-131; 070-440-911-226-114; 074-614-949-934-346; 080-268-228-072-30X; 082-457-107-460-512; 082-852-431-363-589; 098-852-126-092-365; 159-496-108-562-944,8

Shard; Jonathan D. P. Counsell; David J. H. Cant; Emily F. Smith; Parnia Navabpour; Xiaoling Zhang; Christopher J. Blomfield,"This paper provides a description of the transmission function of an XPS instrument operating with exchangeable Al Kα (1486.6 eV) and Ag Lα (2984.3 eV) sources. Both sources use the same quartz crystal monochromator and illuminate the same area of the sample. The transmission-function-corrected data from sputter cleaned gold provides a useful reference material to calibrate other instruments of the same type. Sensitivity factors for Ag Lα and Al Kα are calculated from photoionisation cross sections and electron effective attenuation lengths. These compare well to previous experimental values and data acquired from ionic liquids. The intensity of the Ag Lα source is found to be approximately 50 times lower than the Al Kα source. This, coupled with generally lower photoemission efficiencies, results in noisier data or extended acquisition times. However, there are clear advantages to using the Ag Lα source to analyse certain elements where additional core levels can be accessed and for many technologically important elements where interference from Auger electron peaks can be eliminated. The combination of calibrated data from both sources provides direct and easily interpreted insight into the depth distribution of chemical species. This could be particularly important for topographic samples, where angle resolved experiments are not always helpful. We also demonstrate, using thin coatings of chromium and carbon, that the inelastic background in Ag Lα wide-scan spectra has a significantly increased information depth compared to Al Kα.",51,7,763,773,Analytical chemistry; Electron; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Attenuation; Materials science; Sputtering; Auger electron spectroscopy; Crystal monochromator; Spectral line; Chemical species,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Innovate UK,https://eprintspublications.npl.co.uk/8484/ https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sia.6647 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sia.6647,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sia.6647,,10.1002/sia.6647,2942130251,,0,001-842-499-488-41X; 002-365-502-280-271; 003-860-798-881-600; 007-282-442-443-670; 011-811-566-902-707; 012-005-153-131-545; 014-210-410-038-17X; 017-167-142-461-85X; 019-273-908-281-169; 035-463-871-265-698; 048-958-162-396-43X; 049-406-035-835-031; 053-572-796-499-317; 059-968-077-273-089; 064-649-774-688-418; 068-176-964-906-39X; 073-806-868-388-056; 081-949-147-972-138; 082-067-181-234-456; 087-133-224-830-843; 109-225-302-561-103; 116-943-016-643-925; 116-984-155-374-519; 122-730-978-126-935; 124-492-529-444-294; 133-713-567-683-15X; 144-105-855-261-381; 150-281-681-706-079; 152-538-708-071-661; 163-504-216-956-897; 191-634-742-547-250; 193-982-241-947-209; 198-833-209-652-593,13

Despite extensive use of these data-intensive techniques in both research and public health settings, the ethical issues associated with this science have received minimal attention. As the discipline evolves, there is reasonable concern that existing ethical and legal frameworks and standards might lag behind the rapid methodological developments in this field. This is a follow-up on our earlier work that applied a predetermined analytical framework to examine the perspectives of a sample of scientists from the fields of epidemiology, public health, virology and bioethics on key ethical issues associated with HIV molecular epidemiology in HIV network research. Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with scientists from the fields of molecular epidemiology, public health, virology and bioethics. Inductive analytical approaches were applied to identify key themes that emerged from the data. Our interviewees acknowledged the potential positive impact of molecular epidemiology in the fight against HIV. However, they were concerned that HIV phylogenetics research messages may be incorrectly interpreted if not presented at the appropriate level. There was consensus that HIV phylogenetics research presents a potential risk to privacy, but the probability and magnitude of this risk was less obvious. Although participants acknowledged the social value that could be realized from the analysis of HIV genetic sequences, there was a perceived fear that the boundaries for use of HIV sequence data were not clearly defined. Our findings highlight distinct ethical issues arising from HIV molecular epidemiology. As the discipline evolves and HIV sequence data become increasingly available, it is critical to ensure that ethical standards keep pace with biomedical advancements. We argue that the ethical issues raised in this study, whether real or perceived, require further conceptual and empirical examination.",20,1,1,11,Philosophy of medicine; Public health; Psychology; Bioethics; Qualitative research; Value (ethics); Engineering ethics; Informed consent; Exploratory research; Molecular epidemiology,Data sharing; HIV network research; HIV phylogenetics; In-depth interviews; Informed consent; Molecular epidemiology; People with HIV/AIDS; Privacy/confidentiality; Qualitative methods,"Biomedical Research/ethics; Clinical Trials as Topic/ethics; Confidentiality; Ethics, Research; HIV/genetics; HIV Infections/transmission; Humans; Informed Consent/ethics; Molecular Epidemiology/ethics; Moral Obligations; Phylogeny; Qualitative Research",,Wellcome Trust (096527) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs12910-019-0403-9 https://philpapers.org/rec/MUTEIA-2 https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-019-0403-9 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12910-019-0403-9.pdf https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31590695 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590695,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-019-0403-9,31590695,10.1186/s12910-019-0403-9,2979248650,PMC6781327,0,002-637-506-591-946; 006-079-090-340-941; 006-306-652-824-17X; 010-405-711-488-451; 015-053-505-151-458; 016-823-168-192-295; 019-570-069-506-873; 023-049-212-141-756; 025-611-589-405-748; 025-930-058-871-027; 025-949-599-318-443; 027-171-908-750-60X; 029-112-889-229-044; 029-517-503-460-530; 030-284-106-507-906; 031-737-186-295-311; 032-486-312-722-445; 033-165-421-684-627; 040-636-979-594-956; 043-238-582-252-339; 046-530-575-176-240; 050-335-283-088-32X; 056-258-118-403-56X; 056-544-194-093-134; 060-181-986-082-753; 063-075-757-257-759; 068-328-950-250-449; 076-111-448-521-699; 081-451-062-870-484; 085-049-304-959-060; 095-823-697-004-996; 096-143-535-526-377; 107-187-548-852-78X; 123-136-782-367-790; 138-783-514-027-453; 150-802-128-543-631; 155-589-485-863-897; 164-670-267-373-843,6

Rehm,"There are few better examples of the need for data sharing than in the rare disease community, where patients, physicians, and researchers must search for ""the needle in a haystack"" to uncover rare, novel causes of disease within the genome. Impeding the pace of discovery has been the existence of many small siloed datasets within individual research or clinical laboratory databases and/or disease-specific organizations, hoping for serendipitous occasions when two distant investigators happen to learn they have a rare phenotype in common and can ""match"" these cases to build evidence for causality. However, serendipity has never proven to be a reliable or scalable approach in science. As such, the Matchmaker Exchange (MME) was launched to provide a robust and systematic approach to rare disease gene discovery through the creation of a federated network connecting databases of genotypes and rare phenotypes using a common application programming interface (API). The core building blocks of the MME have been defined and assembled. Three MME services have now been connected through the API and are available for community use. Additional databases that support internal matching are anticipated to join the MME network as it continues to grow.",36,10,915,921,Haystack; World Wide Web; Pace; Serendipity; Information Dissemination; Rare disease; Data sharing; Scalability; Bioinformatics; Biology; Application programming interface,"GA4GH, IRDiRC; Matchmaker Exchange; gene discovery; genomic API; matchmaking; rare disease","Database Management Systems; Databases, Genetic; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Rare Diseases/genetics; Software",,NHGRI NIH HHS (U41HG006834) United States; NCI NIH HHS (N01CO42400-80) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U01 HG007690) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U54HG003273) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U54 HG006542) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (U54 NS065712) United States; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (EP2-120609) Canada; NHGRI NIH HHS (U54HG006542) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U41 HG006834) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U54HG007990) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (HG007530) United States; Wellcome Trust (WT098051) United Kingdom; NHGRI NIH HHS (U54 HG003273) United States; NIH HHS (5R24OD011883) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (U19 HD077671) United States; NIH HHS (R24 OD011883) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (HD077671) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (HG007690) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (U54NS065712) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (T32GM007748) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U54 HG007990) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U01 HG007530) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (5R01NS072248) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (R01NS075764) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (T32 GM007748) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (R01 NS072248) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (R01 NS075764) United States; Canadian Institutes of Health Research (EP1-120608) Canada,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4610002/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26295439 https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/the-matchmaker-exchange-a-platform-for-rare-disease-gene-discover https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/the-matchmaker-exchange-a-platform-for-rare-disease-gene-discover https://core.ac.uk/display/43600376 https://ohsu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/the-matchmaker-exchange-a-platform-for-rare-disease-gene-discover-2 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.22858 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/humu.22858 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Ahbokennisbank.nl%3Asharekit_hsleiden%3Aoai%3Asurfsharekit.nl%3A2eb21d4f-db62-4e7b-860c-979aa014a65d https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/the-matchmaker-exchange-a-platform-for-rare-disease-gene-discover-3 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26295439/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4610002 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/152806 https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2mv1v458,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/humu.22858,26295439,10.1002/humu.22858,2161360183,PMC4610002,0,001-891-090-208-41X; 002-203-796-204-386; 009-995-008-408-883; 011-638-902-098-222; 012-384-685-382-663; 012-676-889-561-30X; 014-511-970-159-745; 016-201-285-405-302; 018-259-649-218-52X; 020-152-624-759-751; 023-365-737-156-584; 029-926-515-313-375; 034-593-660-837-106; 034-889-237-805-767; 042-653-466-147-71X; 046-774-828-886-453; 047-287-488-564-615; 049-912-802-853-33X; 053-023-051-020-373; 053-190-290-676-183; 061-245-467-061-885; 063-402-525-465-255; 065-857-059-194-278; 073-166-763-784-017; 079-490-986-839-903; 140-012-408-936-617,298

This article draws on mixed methods data from rural and urban areas of Ethiopia to explore how access to health information and resources - and subsequently health outcomes - for adolescents are mediated by gender and age norms, living in different geographical locations, poverty, disability and migration. Data was collected in 2017–2018 for the Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence (GAGE) mixed-methods longitudinal research baseline in three regions of Ethiopia (Afar, Amhara and Oromia). Quantitative data was collected from over 6800 adolescents and their caregivers, with qualitative data obtained from a sub-sample of 220 adolescents, their families and communities. Adolescent participants shared their experiences of health, illness and nutrition over the previous year; their knowledge and sources of information about sexual and reproductive health and puberty; and their attitudes toward sexual and reproductive health. Regression analysis was used to explore differences by gender, age, rural/urban residence, and disability status, across a set of adolescents’ health knowledge and other outcomes in the quantitative data. Intersectional analysis was used in analysing the qualitative data. Analysis suggested that gender inequality intersects with age, disability and rural/urban differences to shape young people’s access to information about puberty, with knowledge about this topic particularly lacking amongst younger adolescents in rural areas. Drought and lack of access to clean water exacerbates health challenges for adolescents in rural areas, where a lack of information and absence of access to preventive healthcare services can lead to permanent disability. The research also found that gaps in both school-based and alternative sources of education about puberty and menstruation reinforce stigma and misinformation, especially in rural areas where adolescents have higher school attrition rates. Gendered cultural norms that place high value on marriage and motherhood generate barriers to contraceptive use, particularly in certain rural communities. As they progress through adolescence, young people’s overall health and access to information about their changing bodies is heavily shaped by intersecting social identities. Structural disadvantages such as poverty, distress migration and differential access to healthcare intersect with gender norms to generate further inequalities in adolescent girls’ and boys’ health outcomes.",19,1,1,12,Reproductive health; Rural area; Developmental psychology; Public health; Psychology; Health care; Poverty; Adolescent health; Health services research; Health policy,Adolescence; Gender; Health; Inequality; Intersectionality,Adolescent; Adolescent Health/statistics & numerical data; Adult; Ethiopia; Female; Humans; Male; Poverty/statistics & numerical data; Reproductive Health/statistics & numerical data; Rural Population/statistics & numerical data; Sex Factors; Sexual Behavior/psychology; Social Stigma; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population/statistics & numerical data; Young Adult,,Department for International Development,https://hsrc.himmelfarb.gwu.edu/sphhs_global_facpubs/610/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12939-020-01214-3.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12939-020-01214-3 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296636 https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12939-020-01214-3 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32539778/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01214-3,32539778,10.1186/s12939-020-01214-3,3035348578,PMC7296636,0,001-481-021-050-813; 004-375-984-956-554; 004-957-890-906-812; 005-976-445-736-608; 006-171-728-351-79X; 008-393-688-910-476; 016-378-574-466-236; 017-535-556-686-190; 020-738-832-694-145; 021-691-109-844-66X; 024-173-678-648-051; 027-800-395-342-342; 028-333-919-371-598; 029-701-215-516-245; 032-363-485-153-041; 035-542-852-857-01X; 040-267-688-354-281; 045-934-982-205-074; 046-940-609-928-212; 048-132-690-817-057; 050-744-257-797-891; 050-872-477-291-274; 053-433-958-889-992; 057-151-923-784-525; 058-304-784-581-568; 072-958-947-849-451; 085-248-519-281-666; 088-437-541-790-434; 099-321-091-430-822; 108-442-777-478-076; 109-451-994-239-013; 117-197-899-136-111; 117-647-475-198-322; 122-754-806-280-692; 123-581-199-879-110; 132-411-838-976-166; 134-326-135-966-662; 153-443-250-168-73X; 156-594-189-516-658; 157-491-556-096-54X; 178-153-716-527-266; 196-306-109-452-730,2

Karger AG,Switzerland,Isabelle Budin-Ljøsne; Paul Burton; Julia Isaeva; Amadou Gaye; Andrew Turner; Madeleine J Murtagh; Susan E. Wallace; Vincent Ferretti; Jennifer R. Harris,"Background: DataSHIELD (Data Aggregation Through Anonymous Summary-statistics from Harmonised Individual levEL Databases) has been proposed to facilitate the co-analysis of individual-level data from multiple studies without physically sharing the data. In a previous paper, we investigated whether DataSHIELD could protect participant confidentiality in accordance with UK law. In this follow-up paper, we investigate whether DataSHIELD addresses a broader range of ethics-related data-sharing concerns. Methods: Ethics-related data-sharing concerns of Institutional Review Boards, ethics experts, international research consortia and research participants were identified through a literature search and systematically examined at a multidisciplinary workshop to determine whether DataSHIELD proposes mechanisms which can address these concerns. Results: DataSHIELD addresses several ethics-related data-sharing concerns related to privacy, confidentiality, and the protection of the research participant's rights while sharing data and after the data have been shared.

Bath,"Objectives Meta-analysis based on individual patient data (IPD) from randomised trials is superior to using published summary data since it facilitates subgroup and multiple variable analyses. Guidelines and funders expect that researchers share IPD for bona fide analyses, but in practice, this is done variably. Here, we report the experience of obtaining IPD for two collaborative analysis studies. Setting Two linked studies required IPD from published randomised trials. The leading researchers for eligible trials were approached and asked to share IPD including trial characteristics, patient demographics, baseline clinical data and outcome measures. Participants Participants in eligible randomised controlled trials included patients with or at risk of cognitive decline/vascular events. Primary and secondary outcome measures Numbers (%) of trials where the leading researcher responded favourably/negatively or did not respond. If negative, reasons behind the response were collected. If positive, methods used to share IPD were recorded. Results Across the two studies, 391 completed trials were identified. Email addresses for researchers were found for 313 (80%) of the trials. One hundred and forty-eight (47%) researchers did not respond despite being sent multiple emails. Following contact, positive initial responses were received from 92 researchers, resulting in IPD being shared for 78 trials. Eighty-seven (28%) researchers declined to share data; justifications were recorded. The median time from first request to accessing data in one study was 241 (IQR 383.3) days. IPD sources included: direct from researcher, via academic trial funders repository and a website requiring remote analysis of commercial data. Where data were shared, a variety of methods were used to transfer data. Conclusion Sharing of IPD from trials is desirable and a requirement of many funding bodies. However, accessing IPD faces multiple challenges including refusals to share, delays in access to data and having to perform analyses on a remote website.

Brüggenwirth; Sam Riedijk,"Exome sequencing (ES) enhanced the diagnostic yield of genetic testing, but has also increased the possibility of uncertain findings. Prenatal ES is increasingly being offered after a fetal abnormality is detected through ultrasound. It is important to know how to handle uncertainty in this particularly stressful period. This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of guidelines available for addressing uncertainty related to prenatal chromosomal microarray (CMA) and ES. Ten uncertainty types associated with prenatal ES and CMA were identified and defined by an international multidisciplinary team. Medline (all) and Embase were systematically searched. Laboratory scientists, clinical geneticists, psychologists, and a fetal medicine specialist screened the papers and performed the data extraction. Nineteen papers were included. Recommendations generally emphasized the importance of trio analysis, clinical information, data sharing, validation and re-analysis, protocols, multidisciplinary teams, genetic counselling, whether to limit the possible scope of results, and when to report particular findings. This systematic review helps provide a vocabulary for uncertainties, and a compass to navigate uncertainties. Prenatal CMA and ES guidelines provide a strong starting point for determining how to handle uncertainty. Gaps in guidelines and recommendations were identified and discussed to provide direction for future research and policy making.",100,6,647,658,Psychology; Medical physics; Multidisciplinary approach; Data extraction; Prenatal diagnosis; MEDLINE; Data sharing; Genetic testing; Health policy; Genetic counseling,chromosomal microarray; health planning guidelines; health policy; practice guidelines; prenatal diagnosis; uncertainty; whole exome sequencing,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (211288/Z/18/Z) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155632 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34155632 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34155632 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cge.14010 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34155632/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/cge.14010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cge.14010,34155632,10.1111/cge.14010,3173872554,PMC8596644,0,003-097-748-426-590; 007-498-079-447-601; 009-383-526-640-378; 013-143-562-650-524; 013-541-969-076-695; 014-596-902-619-485; 015-307-411-123-672; 017-300-737-144-757; 019-632-965-300-68X; 021-647-402-216-314; 021-944-720-672-500; 023-126-068-917-009; 023-270-551-046-537; 025-485-444-397-738; 026-496-588-020-761; 027-128-762-535-54X; 027-473-998-355-374; 032-787-901-631-583; 035-912-428-606-487; 042-358-923-627-590; 045-932-616-002-083; 046-404-394-945-306; 053-897-550-990-347; 059-944-968-725-804; 063-742-043-472-402; 069-259-642-576-447; 073-128-389-615-581; 081-081-993-394-337; 083-213-506-085-540; 087-114-450-568-00X; 099-993-498-730-415; 101-888-846-708-317; 107-245-458-371-985; 112-813-494-812-26X; 115-898-457-624-774; 124-462-623-625-350; 127-902-252-048-667; 128-379-144-749-442; 137-379-802-983-609; 143-284-918-988-191,3

Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658 whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4–5 driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4; identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation5,6; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution7; describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity8,9; and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18.",578,7793,82,93,Germline;

The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends. Methods We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016. Findings The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72·3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71·2–73·2) of deaths in 2016 with 19·3% (18·5–20·4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8·43% (8·00–8·67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006–16—age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1·80 million deaths (95% UI 1·59 million to 1·89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176–181) increase in deaths in ages 90–94 years and a 210% (208–212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2·89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1·59%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe. Interpretation The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

To quantify transitions of care between acute hospital trusts and health record systems to guide improvements to data sharing and interoperability. Design Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics. Setting Acute hospital trusts in the NHS in England. Participants All adult patients resident in England that had one or more inpatient, outpatient or accident and emergency encounters at acute NHS hospital trusts between April 2017 and April 2018. Primary and secondary outcome measures Frequency of use and spatial distribution of health record systems. Frequency and spatial distribution of transitions of care between hospital trusts and health record systems. Results 21 286 873 patients were involved in 121 351 837 encounters at 152 included trusts. 117 (77.0%) hospital trusts were using electronic health records (EHR). There was limited regional alignment of EHR systems. On 11 017 767 (9.1%) occasions, patients attended a hospital using a different health record system to their previous hospital attendance. 15 736 863 (73.9%) patients had two or more encounters with the included trusts and 3 931 255 (25.0%) of those attended two or more trusts. Over half (53.6%) of these patients had encounters shared between just 20 pairs of hospitals. Only two of these pairs of trusts used the same EHR system. Conclusions Each year, millions of patients in England attend two or more different hospital trusts. Most of the pairs of trusts that commonly share patients do not use the same record systems. This research highlights significant barriers to inter-hospital data sharing and interoperability. Findings from this study can be used to improve electronic health record system coordination and develop targeted approaches to improve interoperability. The methods used in this study could be used in other healthcare systems that face the same interoperability challenges.",9,12,e031637,,Health informatics; Retrospective cohort study; Medical record; Interoperability; Attendance; Data sharing; Health policy; Health economics; Medical emergency; Medicine,health & safety; health economics; health informatics; health policy; organisation of health services; quality in health care,"Electronic Health Records; England; Health Services Accessibility; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Information Dissemination; Inpatients; Outpatients; Retrospective Studies; State Medicine/organization & administration; Transitional Care",,Department of Health United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31806611 https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/75302 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31806611/ https://www.scilit.net/article/b6e4f602fc2a7950327b27bb9674d8d9 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/9/12/e031637.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7008454 http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/12/e031637 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/9/12/e031637,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031637,31806611,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031637,2993976523,PMC7008454,0,001-223-409-644-034; 009-712-445-547-053; 010-827-698-979-896; 011-103-445-103-047; 011-611-963-010-458; 013-114-795-866-69X; 022-291-703-928-413; 025-060-336-852-234; 027-420-094-416-884; 028-096-638-011-274; 039-981-389-671-976; 045-976-278-872-346; 055-595-509-467-182; 059-518-283-732-225; 074-087-842-888-624; 096-700-960-654-280; 105-515-046-695-929; 111-068-542-089-069; 115-003-058-090-760; 159-825-654-969-404,12

Innovative solutions for data management, data sharing, and for discovering novel datasets are therefore increasingly required. In 2016, we released the first version of the Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI) as a light-weight system to aggregate datasets across multiple public omics data resources. OmicsDI aggregates genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and multiomics datasets, as well as computational models of biological processes. Here, we propose a set of novel metrics to quantify the attention and impact of biomedical datasets. A complete framework (now integrated into OmicsDI) has been implemented in order to provide and evaluate those metrics. Finally, we propose a set of recommendations for authors, journals and data resources to promote an optimal quantification of the impact of datasets. Increasing amount of public omics data are important and valuable resources for the research community. Here, the authors develop a set of metrics to quantify the attention and impact of biomedical datasets and integrate them into the framework of Omics Discovery Index (OmicsDI).",10,1,3512,3512,Omics; Data management; Set (abstract data type); Genomics; Data science; Data sharing; Aggregate (data warehouse); Computer science; Public domain; Computational model,,Access to Information; Computational Biology/statistics & numerical data; Datasets as Topic; Gene Expression Profiling/statistics & numerical data; Genomics/statistics & numerical data; Humans; Information Dissemination; Metabolomics/statistics & numerical data; Proteomics/statistics & numerical data,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NIGMS NIH HHS (U54 GM114833) United States,https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/67586117-832a-3581-af2c-734b52442c8d/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6683138 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11461-w https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31383865 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31383865 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11461-w.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019NatCo..10.3512P/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11461-w,31383865,10.1038/s41467-019-11461-w,2964619400,PMC6683138,0,000-247-234-539-231; 000-290-621-900-801; 001-643-261-960-030; 002-674-207-145-869; 003-391-130-133-101; 003-878-480-447-252; 004-558-303-996-713; 006-101-714-460-131; 010-451-506-103-273; 010-707-366-136-378; 012-770-059-004-038; 018-977-349-722-130; 022-336-046-368-28X; 022-526-129-975-007; 023-558-937-548-815; 024-820-659-482-250; 030-307-018-489-751; 031-522-859-708-339; 035-367-219-414-218; 040-952-173-547-266; 043-334-381-614-751; 043-637-187-040-684; 044-227-566-596-548; 045-743-655-853-646; 051-965-959-247-371; 053-357-896-920-349; 054-938-263-387-291; 058-727-870-036-974; 061-469-386-362-865; 064-831-425-602-55X; 067-312-221-129-478; 070-462-022-251-464; 075-267-966-095-209; 075-864-810-004-468; 079-338-856-881-189; 084-729-110-644-346; 085-508-401-640-932; 094-534-401-459-661; 096-227-622-831-693; 097-088-943-118-521; 098-016-413-464-72X; 102-720-069-491-180; 104-750-714-880-761; 121-573-175-377-172; 123-930-933-291-120; 130-912-912-805-406; 156-163-506-933-267; 158-622-740-675-633; 169-509-828-106-421; 170-618-734-704-365; 195-202-829-900-228,40

However, this approach has been widely criticized as ineffective and misinformed. In this study, we examine media discourse around natural herd immunity in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) to better understand how this approach was promoted. Country-specific news media publications between March 11, 2020 and January 31, 2021 were searched for references to herd immunity. News articles focused on herd immunity and including a stakeholder quote about herd immunity were collected, resulting in 400 UK and 144 US articles. Stakeholder comments were then coded by name, organization, organization type, and concept agreement or disagreement. Government figures and a small but vocal coalition of academics played a central role in promoting natural herd immunity in the news media whereas critics were largely drawn from academia and public health. These groups clashed on whether: natural herd immunity is an appropriate and effective pandemic response; the consequences of a lockdown are worse than those of promoting herd immunity; high-risk populations could be adequately protected; and if healthcare resources would be adequate under a herd immunity strategy. False balance in news media coverage of natural herd immunity as a pandemic response legitimized this approach and potentially undermined more widely accepted mitigation approaches. The ability to protect high risk populations while building herd immunity was a central but poorly supported pillar of this approach. The presentation of herd immunity in news media underscores the need for greater appreciation of potential harm of media representations that contain false balance.</jats:p>",2,1,e0000078,,,,,,"Wellcome Trust; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Alberta Innovates, the Ministry of Economic Development, Trade and Tourism, and the Government of Alberta",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgph.0000078,,10.1371/journal.pgph.0000078,,,0,000-033-193-221-281; 003-442-676-604-646; 004-256-304-361-230; 020-522-904-998-525; 027-733-965-773-180; 030-240-639-525-686; 031-336-890-854-263; 050-589-908-515-361; 063-000-706-225-443; 065-616-526-856-852; 085-216-375-056-948; 086-182-233-715-016; 086-589-854-018-103; 137-126-317-224-654; 137-376-693-652-187; 150-282-201-118-409; 164-965-450-635-977,0
4407,074-970-304-363-92X,Data management and sharing policy: the first step towards promoting data sharing,2019-04-17,2019,journal article,BMC medicine,17417015,BioMed Central,United Kingdom,Naomi Waithira; Brian Mutinda; Phaik Yeong Cheah,"Health-related research funders, regulators and journals expect that de-identified individual-level health data be shared widely, with as few restrictions as possible; yet, in reality, the volume of shared data remains low. Health researchers and other data producers are reluctant to share their data unless they are confident that their datasets are of high quality and reliable, and that they are used in accordance with the values and aims of their institutions. We argue that having an institutional, departmental or group data management and sharing policy is the first step towards encouraging researchers and healthcare professionals to share their data more widely. Our paper outlines the elements of a data management and sharing policy, which should include aims consistent with those of the institution as well as with data management procedures, models of data sharing, request procedures, consent models and cost recovery mechanisms. A policy would help an institution, department or group maximise the use of its data and protect the interests of the institution and its members. We base our recommendations on our experience collecting and curating data for large clinical trials conducted in low- and middle-income countries, facilitating the sharing of datasets with secondary users, whilst teaching data management and conducting empirical research on data sharing. Although the fundamentals of a policy are general, the paper is focused on the low- and middle-income country context. We argue that having an institutional, departmental or group data management and sharing policy is the first step in promoting data sharing.",17,1,80,80,Empirical research; Data management; Quality (business); Data sharing; Context (language use); Institution; Health data; Health professionals; Knowledge management; Medicine,Broad consent; Data management; Data sharing; Data sharing policy; Ethical,Humans; Information Dissemination/methods,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (096527) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (106698/Z/14/Z) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12916-019-1315-8.pdf https://0-bmcmedicine-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1315-8 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30992010/ https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-019-1315-8 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6469100 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-019-1315-8 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/995692 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/995692 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30992010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-019-1315-8,30992010,10.1186/s12916-019-1315-8,2942147027,PMC6469100,0,006-565-656-719-605; 008-345-895-678-669; 014-776-073-215-376; 016-633-159-388-096; 023-097-073-292-349; 024-800-842-732-547; 030-804-649-042-451; 036-312-661-618-588; 037-093-679-560-520; 048-912-199-333-412; 050-066-028-141-899; 051-573-338-288-08X; 053-203-552-783-035; 057-326-382-019-24X; 060-711-673-569-152; 060-840-197-607-218; 076-999-905-905-239; 079-355-774-775-491; 091-182-490-204-656; 097-628-129-516-247; 098-422-711-641-097; 109-895-401-678-262; 135-302-870-468-483,23

Buchanan; Sarah Wordsworth,"There is potential value in incorporating biomedical big data (BBD)-observational real-world patient-level genomic and clinical data in multiple sub-populations-into economic evaluations of precision medicine. However, health economists face practical and methodological challenges when using BBD in this context. We conducted a literature review to identify and summarise these challenges. Relevant articles were identified in MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Cochrane Library from 2000 to 2018. Articles were included if they studied issues relevant to the interconnectedness of biomedical big data, precision medicine, and health economic evaluation. Nineteen articles were included in the review. Challenges identified related to data management, data quality and data analysis. The availability of large volumes of data from multiple sources, the need to conduct data linkages within an environment of opaque data access and sharing procedures, and other data management challenges are primarily practical and may not be long-term obstacles if procedures for data sharing and access are improved. However, the existence of missing data across linked datasets, the need to accommodate dynamic data, and other data quality and analysis challenges may require an evolution in economic evaluation methods. Health economists face challenges when using BBD in economic evaluations of technologies that facilitate precision medicine. Potential solutions to some of these challenges do, however, exist. Going forward, health economists who present work that uses BBD should document challenges and the solutions they have applied to the challenges to support future researcher endeavours.",17,4,443,452,Data management; Data quality; Data science; Economic evaluation; EconLit; Data sharing; Context (language use); Computer science; Data access; Big data,,"Big Data; Cost-Benefit Analysis/economics; Precision Medicine/economics; Technology Assessment, Biomedical/economics",,Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes (NA) International; National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (NA) International; National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (NA) International,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6647451 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40258-019-00474-7 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30941659/ https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:aphecp:v:17:y:2019:i:4:d:10.1007_s40258-019-00474-7 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30941659 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/987520 https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/publications/987520 https://paperity.org/p/192460910/a-review-of-the-challenges-of-using-biomedical-big-data-for-economic-evaluations-of https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40258-019-00474-7.pdf https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s40258-019-00474-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40258-019-00474-7,30941659,10.1007/s40258-019-00474-7,2928772497,PMC6647451,0,008-449-317-431-564; 008-558-621-401-215; 008-696-413-173-698; 011-700-100-556-732; 011-871-848-229-551; 015-121-671-363-175; 022-452-056-842-588; 027-926-945-735-436; 030-405-162-828-809; 031-383-987-236-164; 032-487-098-054-427; 032-961-071-116-005; 034-944-995-464-198; 035-512-982-350-877; 035-650-414-910-237; 035-841-239-794-030; 036-070-110-500-453; 036-148-257-435-606; 036-708-717-657-190; 038-120-940-794-900; 041-030-255-017-192; 042-930-159-137-362; 042-949-383-646-786; 046-869-168-394-307; 047-679-203-629-810; 055-975-789-372-659; 056-630-844-182-587; 058-723-197-720-830; 061-926-976-853-462; 066-308-202-154-231; 069-305-952-957-16X; 073-499-864-861-582; 074-467-833-079-969; 078-850-825-078-98X; 079-137-793-871-512; 079-559-825-923-760; 089-130-403-023-544; 091-052-020-732-643; 091-952-129-951-085; 098-225-536-150-633; 101-384-375-521-791; 103-169-546-865-427; 105-256-769-558-211; 115-656-378-631-982; 116-442-934-553-384; 119-164-599-845-866; 123-438-724-544-764; 134-865-137-258-996; 143-419-040-605-425; 147-059-039-600-095; 172-484-169-523-79X,11

Methods In this open label, phase IV intervention study, 779 young people (2-18 years) with egg allergy were recruited from 30 UK allergy centres and immunised with LAIV. The cohort included 270 (34.7%) young people with previous anaphylaxis to egg, of whom 157 (20.1%) had experienced respiratory and/or cardiovascular symptoms. 445 (57.1%) had doctor diagnosed asthma or recurrent wheeze. Participants were observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination and followed-up by telephone 72 hours later. Participants with a history of recurrent wheeze or asthma underwent further follow-up four weeks later. The main outcome measure was incidence of an adverse event within two hours of vaccination in young people with egg allergy. Study answer and limitations No systemic allergic reactions occurred (upper 95% confidence interval for population 0.47% and in participants with anaphylaxis to egg 1.36%). Nine participants (1.2%, 95% CI 0.5% to 2.2%) experienced mild symptoms, potentially consistent with a local, IgE mediated allergic reaction. Delayed events potentially related to the vaccine were reported in 221 participants. 62 participants (8.1%, 95% CI for population 6.3% to 10.3%) experienced lower respiratory tract symptoms within 72 hours, including 29 with parent reported wheeze. No participants were admitted to hospital. No increase in lower respiratory tract symptoms occurred in the four weeks after vaccination (assessed with asthma control test). The study cohort may represent young people with more severe allergy requiring specialist input, since they were recruited from secondary and tertiary allergy centres. What this study adds LAIV is associated with a low risk of systemic allergic reactions in young people with egg allergy. The vaccine seems to be well tolerated in those with well controlled asthma or recurrent wheeze.

Brown; Barbara Stanley; Sharon Anne Simpson,"Introduction There are no evidence-based interventions that can be administered in hospital settings following a general hospital admission after a suicide attempt. Aim To determine whether a safety planning intervention (SPI) with follow-up telephone support (SAFETEL) is feasible and acceptable to patients admitted to UK hospitals following a suicide attempt. Methods and analysis Three-phase development and feasibility study with embedded process evaluation. Phase I comprises tailoring an SPI with telephone follow-up originally designed for veterans in the USA, for use in the UK. Phase II involves piloting the intervention with patients (n=30) who have been hospitalised following a suicide attempt. Phase III is a feasibility randomised controlled trial of 120 patients who have been hospitalised following a suicide attempt with a 6-month follow-up. Phase III participants will be recruited from across four National Health Service hospitals in Scotland and randomised to receive either the SPI with telephone follow-up and treatment as usual (n=80) or treatment as usual only (n=40). The primary outcomes are feasibility outcomes and include the acceptability of the intervention to participants and intervention staff, the feasibility of delivery in this setting, recruitment, retention and intervention adherence as well as the feasibility of collecting the self-harm re-admission to hospital outcome data. Statistical analyses will include description of recruitment rates, intervention adherence/use, response rates and estimates of the primary outcome event rates, and intervention effect size (Phase III). Thematic analyses will be conducted on interview and focus group data. Ethics and dissemination The East of Scotland Research Ethics Service (EoSRES) approved this study in March 2017 (GN17MH101 Ref: 17/ES/0036). The study results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations. A participant summary paper will also be disseminated to patients, service providers and policy makers alongside the main publication.

Pfister; Stefaan Van Gool,"Paediatric CNS tumours are the most common cause of childhood cancer-related morbidity and mortality, and improvements in their diagnosis and treatment are needed. New genetic and epigenetic information about paediatric CNS tumours is transforming the field dramatically. For most paediatric CNS tumour entities, subgroups with distinct biological characteristics have been identified, and these characteristics are increasingly used to facilitate accurate diagnoses and therapeutic recommendations. Future treatments will be further tailored to specific molecular subtypes of disease, specific tumour predisposition syndromes, and other biological criteria. Successful biomaterial collection is a key requirement for the application of contemporary methodologies for the validation of candidate prognostic factors, the discovery of new biomarkers, the establishment of appropriate preclinical research models for targeted agents, a quicker clinical implementation of precision medicine, and for other therapeutic uses (eg, for immunotherapies). However, deficits in organisational structures and interdisciplinary cooperation are impeding the collection of high-quality biomaterial from CNS tumours in most centres. Practical, legal, and ethical guidelines for consent, storage, material transfer, biobanking, data sharing, and funding should be established by research consortia and local institutions to allow optimal collection of primary and subsequent tumour tissue, body fluids, and normal tissue. Procedures for the collection and storage of biomaterials and related data should be implemented according to the individual and organisational structures of the local institutions.",19,8,e419,e428,Biobank; Translational research; Precision medicine; Intensive care medicine; Disease; MEDLINE; Data sharing; Medical diagnosis; Medicine; Position paper,,"Biological Specimen Banks/ethics; Biomarkers, Tumor; Central Nervous System Neoplasms; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Oncology/organization & administration; Translational Research, Biomedical/methods","Biomarkers, Tumor",Cancer Research UK (11736) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (13457) United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (13982) United Kingdom,https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/biological-material-collection-to-advance-translational-research- https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F377256 https://www.eprints.ncl.ac.uk/250543 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30102236/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204518303644 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02110602 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(18)30364-4/fulltext https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/biological-material-collection-to-advance-translational-research- https://repub.eur.nl/pub/109662 http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/377256 https://fis-uke.de/portal/en/publications/biological-material-collection-to-advance-translational-research-and-treatment-of-children-with-cns-tumours(2f70feb1-38d1-4746-be9c-c7c2ab5e7603).html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30102236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1470-2045(18)30364-4,30102236,10.1016/s1470-2045(18)30364-4,2887665498,,0,000-061-398-047-051; 002-836-912-395-598; 002-837-974-101-430; 003-278-682-873-138; 004-019-095-273-381; 006-325-531-862-835; 006-946-752-176-62X; 008-251-487-746-303; 009-320-250-742-446; 011-188-567-862-135; 011-417-602-889-39X; 014-803-287-591-60X; 015-437-066-270-06X; 016-886-625-734-60X; 018-886-105-023-348; 023-167-943-667-951; 023-968-052-516-738; 024-657-723-943-481; 025-216-763-473-325; 026-678-884-780-957; 026-860-337-152-944; 026-907-191-563-040; 027-332-781-634-496; 027-617-942-897-238; 028-349-677-388-94X; 029-250-153-352-600; 029-339-564-828-467; 030-927-598-114-098; 031-966-942-310-898; 033-846-136-647-724; 036-984-779-317-336; 038-839-755-222-924; 040-094-679-017-74X; 040-856-603-491-865; 041-236-442-551-706; 041-298-440-438-922; 041-809-582-537-856; 044-543-364-871-577; 046-243-391-384-860; 047-606-032-521-794; 047-955-690-972-605; 048-152-669-308-483; 048-750-956-177-068; 049-989-488-206-788; 050-016-903-001-822; 051-466-148-244-090; 055-346-513-245-876; 056-675-574-954-434; 057-764-998-933-195; 062-288-991-502-110; 062-375-709-053-557; 062-418-754-018-205; 062-568-121-802-431; 065-223-874-508-486; 065-691-600-871-090; 066-108-631-280-475; 066-335-486-744-869; 066-474-405-957-273; 067-499-940-255-828; 074-184-541-753-501; 075-087-221-519-128; 076-069-720-623-007; 076-156-824-068-47X; 079-970-211-952-436; 092-323-085-333-158; 100-112-325-408-146; 102-475-507-879-681; 105-076-365-320-110; 105-077-430-935-133; 105-667-718-142-829; 119-793-121-819-089; 130-012-768-449-481; 134-940-611-990-525; 142-792-200-304-453; 147-882-013-557-43X; 152-638-737-335-169,12

Berinsky; Stephan Lewandowsky; Ullrich K. H. Ecker,"This study investigated the cognitive processing of true and false political information. Specifically, it examined the impact of source credibility on the assessment of veracity when information comes from a polarizing source (Experiment 1), and effectiveness of explanations when they come from one's own political party or an opposition party (Experiment 2). These experiments were conducted prior to the 2016 Presidential election. Participants rated their belief in factual and incorrect statements that President Trump made on the campaign trail; facts were subsequently affirmed and misinformation retracted. Participants then re-rated their belief immediately or after a delay. Experiment 1 found that (i) if information was attributed to Trump, Republican supporters of Trump believed it more than if it was presented without attribution, whereas the opposite was true for Democrats and (ii) although Trump supporters reduced their belief in misinformation items following a correction, they did not change their voting preferences. Experiment 2 revealed that the explanation's source had relatively little impact, and belief updating was more influenced by perceived credibility of the individual initially purporting the information. These findings suggest that people use political figures as a heuristic to guide evaluation of what is true or false, yet do not necessarily insist on veracity as a prerequisite for supporting political candidates.",4,3,160802,160802,Attribution; Psychology; Presidential election; Source credibility; Misinformation; Opposition (politics); Phenomenon; Voting; Social psychology; Politics,belief updating; continued influence effect; misinformation; motivated cognition; source credibility,,,Royal Society; University of Western Australia; Australian-American Fulbright Commission; Psychonomic Society; Australian Research Council,https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/cadc711c-f89b-30a7-8225-975b566066b3/ https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/processing-political-misinformation-comprehending-the-trump-pheno https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28405366/ http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/108430474/Full_text_PDF_final_published_version_.pdf https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/110045 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017RSOS....460802S/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/83929580 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28405366 https://doaj.org/article/fe284165bb8242249f02bb1ae259105a https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28405366 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/108430474/Full_text_PDF_final_published_version_.pdf https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.160802 https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.160802 https://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royopensci/4/3/160802.full.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/83929580.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsos.160802,28405366,10.1098/rsos.160802,2593816498,PMC5383823,0,000-244-861-983-581; 000-537-728-327-568; 002-094-462-506-544; 002-506-550-449-437; 003-609-425-235-761; 003-704-353-801-095; 005-245-125-759-203; 008-627-174-380-26X; 009-446-224-708-758; 009-734-196-040-223; 011-238-026-793-635; 015-475-547-173-305; 018-373-694-205-946; 019-457-467-535-413; 025-025-066-356-228; 025-657-363-631-914; 025-878-208-001-233; 026-704-703-139-447; 028-572-061-486-615; 031-672-019-523-79X; 034-228-291-956-162; 037-558-280-140-150; 040-566-530-138-503; 043-105-843-942-671; 046-622-317-412-19X; 053-459-201-895-587; 054-938-373-448-403; 056-938-462-750-324; 057-438-517-134-947; 062-179-148-302-948; 064-372-419-497-36X; 065-629-717-974-272; 068-916-417-725-945; 076-756-085-560-426; 087-796-285-757-341; 088-399-393-778-411; 092-620-146-279-038; 093-665-351-321-19X; 102-669-662-449-10X; 103-854-123-090-24X; 110-922-307-852-881; 114-728-792-322-759; 115-087-071-547-412; 127-881-700-259-856; 134-287-809-759-215; 138-424-397-048-92X; 143-157-613-858-693; 145-717-974-988-894; 151-264-871-254-140; 171-505-386-709-359,171

In F-RANs, distributed edge caching techniques among remote radio heads (RRHs) and user equipment (UE) can effectively alleviate the burdens on the fronthaul toward the base band unit pool and the bandwidth of the RANs. However, it is still not clear as to how social relationships affect the performance of edge caching schemes. This paper attempts to analyze the impact of mobile social networks (MSNs) on the performance of edge caching in F-RANs. We propose a Markov-chain-based model to analyze edge caching among edge nodes (i.e., RRHs and MSNs), as well as data sharing among the potential MSNs from the viewpoint of content diffusion in the F-RANs. Moreover, we analyze the edge caching schemes among UE to minimize the bandwidth consumption in the RANs. Finally, the optimal edge caching strategies among RRHs in terms of caching locations and time are introduced to minimize the bandwidth consumption of fronthaul and storage costs in the F-RANs. Simulation results show that the proposed edge caching schemes among UE and RRHs are able to reduce the bandwidth consumption of RANs and fronthaul effectively.",5,,8492,8501,Distributed computing; Mobile computing; Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution; Bandwidth (computing); Fronthaul; User equipment; Radio access; Computer network; Computer science; Baseband,,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China; EU FP7 Project CLIMBER; EU FP7 Project CROWN; UK EPSRC Project NIRVANA; UK EPSRC Project DANCER; Program of the China Scholarship Council",https://doaj.org/article/85d75d4f5987417e896b054a68c2d9fd https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7907239/ https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2693440 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/access/access5.html#WangLY17 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/20425/ https://core.ac.uk/download/96933731.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2017.2693440,,10.1109/access.2017.2693440,2608218528,,2,024-172-024-505-882; 026-893-861-911-354; 028-380-490-085-32X; 032-650-692-622-498; 050-007-002-975-043; 050-244-761-430-174; 050-491-366-830-58X; 054-333-552-156-500; 058-438-109-759-020; 062-304-755-988-38X; 080-252-595-836-635; 080-812-076-206-466; 081-163-775-900-376; 093-274-851-611-048; 096-541-875-717-800; 104-623-970-723-544; 107-343-102-004-729; 113-142-903-401-595; 126-083-811-291-944; 154-733-238-301-894,52

To make a diagnosis of ADHD, clinicians draw on information from multiple sources, including parents and teachers. However, obtaining these is particularly difficult for young people in the secure estate. There is increasing evidence in the community that QbTest is able to assist in the accurate and earlier diagnosis of ADHD. The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of QbTest in the assessment of ADHD within the CYPSE. Methods and analysis A single-centre parallel group feasibility randomised controlled trial will be conducted. Sixty young people within the CYPSE identified as displaying possible symptoms of ADHD will be randomised to the intervention arm (n=30; QbTest plus usual care) or control arm (n=30; usual care). Primary analyses will be descriptive and a process evaluation will be conducted to assess the contexts involved in implementing the intervention. Interviews will be conducted to explore acceptability and thematic analysis will be used to analyse the data. Ethics and dissemination This study was approved by National Health Service Wales research ethics committee 3 (18/WA/0347) on 15 February 2019. The findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at relevant conferences and disseminated to the public via summaries cocreated with our patient and public involvement group.

We performed an in-depth case study of one data sharing pioneer: the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN). Methods: The case study included a records review, a quantitative analysis of WAARN-related publications, in-depth interviews with 47 people familiar with WWARN, and a witness seminar involving a sub-set of 11 interviewees. Results: WWARN originally aimed to collate clinical, in vitro, pharmacological and molecular data into linked, open-access databases intended to serve as a public resource to guide antimalarial drug treatment policies. Our study describes how WWARN navigated challenging institutional and academic incentive structures, alongside funders' reluctance to invest in capacity building in malaria-endemic countries, which impeded data sharing. The network increased data contributions by focusing on providing free, online tools to improve the quality and efficiency of data collection, and by inviting collaborative authorship on papers addressing policy-relevant questions that could only be answered through pooled analyses. By July 1, 2016, the database included standardised data from 103 molecular studies and 186 clinical trials, representing 135,000 individual patients. Developing the database took longer and cost more than anticipated, and efforts to increase equity for data contributors are on-going. However, analyses of the pooled data have generated new methods and influenced malaria treatment recommendations globally. Despite not achieving the initial goal of real-time surveillance, WWARN has developed strong data governance and curation tools, which are now being adapted relatively quickly for other diseases. Conclusions: To be useful, data sharing requires investment in long-term infrastructure. To be feasible, it requires new incentive structures that favour the generation of reusable knowledge.",2,,63,63,Data collection; Library science; Data governance; Equity (finance); Quality (business); Capacity building; Data sharing; Incentive; Global health; Knowledge management; Medicine,LMIC; WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network; bioinformatics; data sharing; global health; incentives; research collaboration; research infrastructure,,,Wellcome Trust,https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4647044/ https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/publications/1162942 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29018840 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/2-63/v1/xml https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/2-63/v1/pdf https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/2-63 https://core.ac.uk/display/153535395 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29018840 https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR44665 https://core.ac.uk/download/153535395.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.12259.1,29018840,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.12259.1,2749818851,PMC5627501,0,002-151-905-482-480; 003-828-541-162-096; 005-455-075-448-647; 007-463-981-208-138; 009-574-630-997-213; 015-227-688-423-184; 015-936-627-093-435; 017-489-366-232-601; 030-833-975-647-205; 031-589-728-194-127; 031-951-380-152-506; 035-990-807-421-11X; 038-824-642-263-293; 043-166-737-771-417; 051-023-032-722-908; 058-623-229-990-651; 069-029-068-683-235; 074-614-949-934-346; 075-563-535-032-413; 077-103-695-106-237; 078-458-044-056-597; 080-986-410-560-875; 092-609-242-259-910; 110-286-024-990-497; 114-232-669-866-014; 120-454-096-639-80X; 126-871-425-351-950; 130-489-881-838-970; 172-272-851-377-348,10

In order to perform the economic evaluations associated with RCTs, there is a need for accessible and good quality resource-use data; for the purpose of discussion here, data that best reflect the care received. Traditionally, researchers have developed questionnaires for resource-use data collection. However, the evolution of routinely collected electronic data within care services provides new opportunities for collecting data without burdening patients or caregivers (e.g. clinicians). This paper describes the potential strengths and limitations of each data collection method and then discusses aspects for consideration before choosing which method to use. We describe electronic data sources (large observational datasets, commissioning data, and raw data extraction) that may be suitable data sources for informing clinical trials and the current status of self-reported instruments for measuring resource-use. We assess the methodological risks and benefits, and compare the two methodologies. We focus on healthcare resource-use; however, many of the considerations have relevance to clinical questions. Patient self-report forms a pragmatic and cheap method that is largely under the control of the researcher. However, there are known issues with the validity of the data collected, loss to follow-up may be high, and questionnaires suffer from missing data. Routinely collected electronic data may be more accurate and more practical if large numbers of patients are involved. However, datasets often incur a cost and researchers are bound by the time for data approval and extraction by the data holders. Owing to the issues associated with electronic datasets, self-reported methods may currently be the preferred option. However, electronic hospital data are relatively more accessible, informative, standardised, and reliable. Therefore in trials where secondary care constitutes a major driver of patient care, detailed electronic data may be considered superior to self-reported methods; with the caveat of requiring data sharing agreements with third party providers and potentially time-consuming extraction periods. Self-reported methods will still be required when a ‘societal’ perspective (e.g. quantifying informal care) is desirable for the intended analysis.",19,1,8,8,Raw data; Data collection; Health care; Observational study; Data science; Data sharing; Electronic data; Computer science; Big data; Missing data,Big data; Data collection methodology; Large observational datasets; Routinely collected data; Self-report; Trial-based evaluation,Data Accuracy; Datasets as Topic/statistics & numerical data; Electronic Health Records/statistics & numerical data; England; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Self Report/statistics & numerical data,,Medical Research Council (MR/L004933/2) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K025643/1) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30626337 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/selfreported-and-routinely-collected-electronic-healthcare-resourceuse-data-for-trialbased-economic-evaluations(e93ace84-3237-49ce-8b2a-7ff201acde6d).html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325715/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6325715/ https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/141254/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12874-018-0649-9.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12874-018-0649-9 https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12874-018-0649-9 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/182610694/document.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/199222245.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12874-018-0649-9,30626337,10.1186/s12874-018-0649-9,2911955223,PMC6325715,0,000-942-421-253-751; 001-842-809-542-224; 004-611-534-176-034; 006-830-385-731-446; 010-667-854-464-190; 012-340-708-506-565; 012-504-191-802-596; 012-652-744-781-145; 016-512-479-468-051; 016-974-571-849-531; 017-339-977-258-823; 018-779-174-157-231; 026-545-089-620-808; 028-488-467-937-613; 029-910-741-061-042; 029-943-692-854-548; 035-774-688-423-799; 036-705-896-546-512; 039-888-271-214-204; 040-265-626-134-786; 041-649-536-003-976; 042-918-205-017-58X; 043-681-207-915-213; 044-333-639-709-718; 046-743-840-351-177; 052-119-460-929-895; 056-167-421-656-443; 061-331-303-605-971; 061-689-943-289-432; 061-900-485-508-052; 063-497-839-768-835; 065-120-230-186-707; 066-710-952-209-815; 070-007-458-412-172; 071-546-463-318-745; 074-642-200-472-395; 075-760-366-525-307; 083-321-021-435-838; 086-496-397-125-84X; 086-911-560-373-292; 090-195-143-080-093; 092-749-882-077-271; 093-223-639-037-843; 103-222-118-841-576; 103-532-250-467-511; 111-249-487-120-790; 138-684-709-292-130; 153-302-071-345-631; 158-478-852-505-571; 163-329-152-156-499; 176-136-020-863-264,16

Wilkie,"The clinical utility of computational phenotyping for both genetic and rare diseases is increasingly appreciated; however, its true potential is yet to be fully realized. Alongside the growing clinical and research availability of sequencing technologies, precise deep and scalable phenotyping is required to serve unmet need in genetic and rare diseases. To improve the lives of individuals affected with rare diseases through deep phenotyping, global big data interrogation is necessary to aid our understanding of disease biology, assist diagnosis, and develop targeted treatment strategies. This includes the application of cutting-edge machine learning methods to image data. As with most digital tools employed in health care, there are ethical and data governance challenges associated with using identifiable personal image data. There are also risks with failing to deliver on the patient benefits of these new technologies, the biggest of which is posed by data siloing. The Minerva Initiative has been designed to enable the public good of deep phenotyping while mitigating these ethical risks.

Applied,19392192; 1076898x,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Ullrich K. H. Ecker; Stephan Lewandowsky; Ee Pin Chang; Rekha Pillai,"Information presented in news articles can be misleading without being blatantly false. Experiment 1 examined the effects of misleading headlines that emphasize secondary content rather than the article's primary gist. We investigated how headlines affect readers' processing of factual news articles and opinion pieces, using both direct memory measures and more indirect reasoning measures. Experiment 2 examined an even more subtle type of misdirection. We presented articles featuring a facial image of one of the protagonists, and examined whether the headline and opening paragraph of an article affected the impressions formed of that face even when the person referred to in the headline was not the person portrayed. We demonstrate that misleading headlines affect readers' memory, their inferential reasoning and behavioral intentions, as well as the impressions people form of faces. On a theoretical level, we argue that these effects arise not only because headlines constrain further information processing, biasing readers toward a specific interpretation, but also because readers struggle to update their memory in order to correct initial misconceptions. Practical implications for news consumers and media literacy are discussed.

Using a sample of 4.953 digital start-ups the paper evaluates the impact of start-up founding teams’ higher education on the probability of securing equity investment and subsequent exit for investors. The main findings are: (1), teams with a founder that has a technical education are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and to exit, but the impact of technical education declines with higher level degrees, (2) teams with a founder that has doctoral level business education are less likely to remain self-financed and have a higher probability of securing equity investment, while undergraduate and postgraduate business education have no significant effect, and (3) teams with a founder that has an undergraduate general education (arts and humanities) are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and exit while postgraduate and doctoral general education have no significant effect on securing equity investment and exit. The findings enhance our understanding of factors that influence digital start-ups achieving equity milestones by showing the heterogeneous influence of different types of higher education, and therefore human capital, on new ventures achieving equity milestones. The results suggest that researchers and policy-makers should extend their consideration of universities entrepreneurial activity to include the development of human capital.",43,3,760,778,Higher education; Equity capital markets; Labour economics; Equity risk; Private equity secondary market; Economics; Marketing; Private equity fund; Private equity firm; Business education; Club deal,Digital economy; Equity investments; Human capital; University qualifications,,,Science and Technology Facilities Council; Science and Technology Facilities Council,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6560697 http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/43470/ https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/935499 https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/jtecht/v43y2018i3d10.1007_s10961-017-9627-3.html https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10961-017-9627-3.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10961-017-9627-3 https://core.ac.uk/download/82964818.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10961-017-9627-3,31258242,10.1007/s10961-017-9627-3,2727374237,PMC6560697,0,001-208-959-929-08X; 003-701-428-186-40X; 005-315-841-633-071; 006-544-875-692-577; 013-346-802-330-619; 013-584-636-635-727; 015-251-294-337-785; 016-656-663-355-738; 019-193-643-394-28X; 026-191-955-764-870; 027-059-612-881-037; 027-649-743-381-753; 028-109-067-002-031; 029-945-070-016-995; 033-660-074-587-90X; 033-780-217-450-457; 034-020-985-990-311; 035-371-201-443-59X; 038-017-229-313-25X; 042-792-034-718-785; 044-361-404-273-823; 044-564-918-878-870; 044-792-881-849-957; 045-572-148-952-267; 047-774-405-747-570; 056-631-976-651-597; 060-235-213-476-823; 060-400-257-893-318; 062-071-868-481-636; 064-522-769-390-715; 066-635-205-812-285; 067-890-669-197-561; 074-942-960-657-75X; 079-662-364-149-164; 080-010-525-068-595; 087-947-492-346-989; 091-651-476-017-941; 091-884-383-853-921; 094-407-405-677-779; 095-065-522-138-300; 095-624-738-388-50X; 119-515-432-865-226; 119-650-380-173-616; 120-094-718-338-889; 122-088-987-864-176; 123-656-482-681-795; 128-839-151-585-284; 136-588-091-632-734; 137-005-861-424-587; 139-659-046-209-202; 144-476-816-362-350; 147-376-286-168-42X; 156-400-087-782-834; 159-720-587-870-015; 165-752-991-827-776; 176-554-029-089-73X; 182-081-763-447-300,27

Shelmerdine; J. Ciaran Hutchinson; Neil J. Sebire; Owen J. Arthurs,"Perinatal autopsy is the standard method for investigating fetal death; however, it requires dissection of the fetus. Human fetal microfocus computed tomography (micro-CT) provides a generally more acceptable and less invasive imaging alternative for bereaved parents to determine the cause of early pregnancy loss compared with conventional autopsy techniques. In this protocol, we describe the four main stages required to image fetuses using micro-CT. Preparation of the fetus includes staining with the contrast agent potassium triiodide and takes 3-19 d, depending on the size of the fetus and the time taken to obtain consent for the procedure. Setup for imaging requires appropriate positioning of the fetus and takes 1 h. The actual imaging takes, on average, 2 h 40 min and involves initial test scans followed by high-definition diagnostic scans. Postimaging, 3 d are required to postprocess the fetus, including removal of the stain, and also to undertake artifact recognition and data transfer. This procedure produces high-resolution isotropic datasets, allowing for radio-pathological interpretations to be made and long-term digital archiving for re-review and data sharing, where required. The protocol can be undertaken following appropriate training, which includes both the use of micro-CT techniques and handling of postmortem tissue.",16,5,2594,2614,Dissection; Radiology; Fetus; Artifact (error); Stain; Computed tomographic; Human fetal; Perinatal autopsy; Whole body; Medicine,,"Autopsy/methods; Fetus/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Staining and Labeling; Time Factors; X-Ray Microtomography",,Department of Health (NIHR-CDF-2017-10-037) United Kingdom; Department of Health (ICA-CDRF-2017-03-53) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/R00218/1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33854254 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00512-6 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33854254 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00512-6.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33854254/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41596-021-00512-6,33854254,10.1038/s41596-021-00512-6,3155640781,,0,000-197-095-784-815; 000-366-187-535-802; 001-235-303-807-251; 001-470-134-354-668; 002-730-781-433-391; 005-931-299-681-557; 006-209-305-156-58X; 006-296-678-806-82X; 006-662-337-989-899; 006-955-238-254-861; 008-705-503-022-676; 010-192-114-700-825; 013-171-613-134-051; 014-891-588-695-51X; 015-228-514-603-059; 017-209-848-579-625; 019-209-955-093-287; 020-418-466-471-802; 020-704-657-291-780; 022-155-269-069-831; 022-942-744-493-731; 024-254-678-903-790; 029-249-067-914-365; 030-228-922-568-102; 030-915-358-283-134; 031-722-252-976-958; 032-948-270-480-698; 033-963-981-732-515; 034-349-834-286-46X; 036-727-215-027-838; 038-005-231-466-740; 038-065-360-982-236; 040-276-937-856-27X; 042-376-002-401-57X; 044-045-419-128-413; 047-614-849-458-320; 050-064-187-511-261; 050-955-665-806-355; 051-958-940-111-874; 052-908-122-139-219; 056-179-709-446-996; 057-703-884-623-472; 059-579-147-829-929; 062-844-905-836-507; 063-427-775-766-924; 063-882-422-267-905; 064-713-074-630-577; 068-329-532-480-414; 071-677-340-173-363; 077-334-096-454-799; 079-679-803-337-927; 081-207-123-502-42X; 084-744-213-571-253; 087-130-360-401-361; 096-028-567-267-230; 097-052-800-852-601; 099-313-158-313-031; 100-206-289-971-747; 104-907-159-384-592; 107-875-288-960-934; 119-829-336-799-056; 120-219-704-952-85X; 121-081-482-944-64X; 122-137-254-113-963; 149-804-038-259-884; 154-836-795-167-108,3

This consortium is a grass-roots organization formed to advance the annotation of newly assembled genomes of domesticated and non-model organisms (www.faang.org). The workshop gathered together from around the world a group of 100+ genome scientists, administrators, representatives of funding agencies and commodity groups to discuss the latest advancements of the consortium, new perspectives, next steps and implementation plans. The workshop was streamed live and recorded, and all talks, along with speaker slide presentations, are available at www.faang.org. In this report, we describe the major activities and outcomes of this meeting. We also provide updates on ongoing efforts to implement discussions and decisions taken at GO-FAANG to guide future FAANG activities.

Fienberg; Aleksandra B. Slavkovic; Caroline Uhler,"Abstract The protection of privacy of individual-level information in genome-wide association study (GWAS) databases has been a major concern of researchers following the publication of “an attack” on GWAS data by Homer et al. (2008). Traditional statistical methods for confidentiality and privacy protection of statistical databases do not scale well to deal with GWAS data, especially in terms of guarantees regarding protection from linkage to external information. The more recent concept of differential privacy, introduced by the cryptographic community, is an approach that provides a rigorous definition of privacy with meaningful privacy guarantees in the presence of arbitrary external information, although the guarantees may come at a serious price in terms of data utility. Building on such notions, Uhler et al. (2013) proposed new methods to release aggregate GWAS data without compromising an individual’s privacy. We extend the methods developed in Uhler et al. (2013) for releasing differentially-private χ 2 -statistics by allowing for arbitrary number of cases and controls, and for releasing differentially-private allelic test statistics. We also provide a new interpretation by assuming the controls’ data are known, which is a realistic assumption because some GWAS use publicly available data as controls. We assess the performance of the proposed methods through a risk-utility analysis on a real data set consisting of DNA samples collected by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and compare the methods with the differentially-private release mechanism proposed by Johnson and Shmatikov (2013).",50,,133,141,Data mining; Cryptography; Differential privacy; Data sharing; Computer science; Scalability; Data set; Pearson's chi-squared test; Confidentiality; Statistical hypothesis testing,Allelic test; Contingency table; Differential privacy; Genome-wide association study (GWAS); Pearson -test; Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),Crohn Disease/genetics; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Privacy,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NCRR NIH HHS (UL1 RR033184) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR000127) United States,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.008 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.5193 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/scalable-privacy-preserving-data-sharing-methodology-for-genome-w https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1532046414000100 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.008 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jbi/jbi50.html#YuFSU14 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.008 https://core.ac.uk/display/104263532 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046414000100 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24509073 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4221263 https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5193 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1401.5193Y/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.008,24509073,10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.008,2124940696,PMC4221263,2,001-627-003-427-559; 002-637-506-591-946; 002-664-127-489-144; 003-010-703-233-272; 009-580-307-830-334; 009-944-048-845-519; 011-076-534-151-883; 011-197-154-422-507; 016-513-542-264-372; 018-056-290-340-35X; 029-635-862-026-75X; 034-432-752-164-95X; 046-931-988-722-980; 049-420-094-678-313; 058-316-900-826-04X; 065-362-122-051-356; 066-206-350-733-078; 067-498-492-626-466; 072-920-250-384-590; 075-131-978-164-985; 079-787-879-356-102; 090-067-437-484-556; 092-845-700-587-757; 095-598-308-151-08X; 143-617-378-478-280,118

Fears of exploitation, however, both of research participants and researchers from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), can undermine the free flow of data necessary for scientific advancement. In this Open Letter, two case studies presented at the 2018 Global Forum on Bioethics in Research meeting on the Ethics of data sharing and biobanking in Cape Town, South Africa, function as the focal point for a reflection on the attributes of an ideal model of good data governance and how it can help support ethical best practices in biobanking and data sharing. Consideration of the case studies as well as the literature indicate three broad principles that need to be reflected in an ideal data governance framework: (i) collaboration - both among researchers as well as between researchers and participants, (ii) fairness - ensuring that all parties in international collaborations, the data provider, primary data gathering LMIC researcher and the high income country (HIC) institution/funder are treated fairly, and (iii) working towards a level playing field - neither collaboration nor fairness can be effectively achieved with the existing power differential between HIC and LMIC researchers/institutions; it is therefore necessary to work towards achieving a more level playing field between partners in research collaborations. Promoting good governance of data through fair, efficient and accountable governance frameworks can help build trust and ensure continued international data sharing.",4,,184,,Political science; Best practice; Bioethics; Data governance; Capacity building; Level playing field; Data sharing; Good governance; Corporate governance; Public relations,Data-sharing; LMIC; biobanking; capacity building; collaboration; data governance frameworks; fairness,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-184 https://www.spcr.nihr.ac.uk/publications/advancing-good-governance-in-data-sharing-and-biobanking-international-aspects https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6945104 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-184/v1/xml https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31950088/ https://core.ac.uk/download/286983044.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15540.1,31950088,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15540.1,2991124691,PMC6945104,0,001-375-967-057-160; 002-246-798-458-734; 010-527-516-552-564; 013-832-801-324-958; 013-936-447-318-809; 020-607-757-075-917; 025-511-042-280-154; 035-813-132-606-003; 038-824-642-263-293; 064-281-339-441-928; 084-823-151-929-541; 085-320-250-288-390; 086-075-142-881-357; 086-470-411-539-657; 091-182-490-204-656; 094-834-168-358-542; 095-586-015-547-357; 096-008-223-412-950; 097-628-129-516-247; 194-308-215-234-055,10

This report provides background information and recommendations aimed at minimising pain, suffering and distress in rodent models of epilepsy and seizures in order to improve animal welfare and optimise the quality of studies in this area. The report includes practical guidance on principles of choosing a model, induction procedures, in vivo recordings, perioperative care, welfare assessment, humane endpoints, social housing, environmental enrichment, reporting of studies and data sharing. In addition, some model-specific welfare considerations are discussed, and data gaps and areas for further research are identified. The guidance is based upon a systematic review of the scientific literature, survey of the international epilepsy research community, consultation with veterinarians and animal care and welfare officers, and the expert opinion and practical experience of the members of a Working Group convened by the United Kingdom's National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs).",260,,2,25,Welfare;

Crawford,"Most patients with chest pain have nothing wrong with their cardiac function. Psychological forms of treatment for this condition are more likely to be successful than others. A two-arm parallel controlled randomized trial of standard care versus a modified form of cognitive behaviour therapy for chest pain (CBT-CP) in patients who have attended emergency hospital services. Inclusion criteria include (i) emergency attendance more than once in the previous year with chest pain when no physical pathology has been found, (ii) aged between 16 and 75, (iii) signed consent to take part in the study. Exclusion criteria are (i) under current psychiatric care, (ii) those who have had new psychotropic drugs prescribed within the last two months, (iii) are receiving or about to receive a formal psychological treatment. Those satisfying these criteria will be randomized to 4–10 sessions of CBT-CP or to continue with standard care. Participants are randomized using a remote web-based system using permuted stacked blocks stratified by study centre. Assessment is carried out at baseline by researchers subsequently masked to allocation and at 6 months and 1 year after randomization. The primary outcome is the Health Anxiety Inventory score at 6 months, and secondary outcomes are generalised anxiety and depressive symptoms, the Lucock Health Anxiety Questionnaire adapted for chest pain, visual analogue scales for chest pain and discomfort (Inskip Scale), the Schedule for Evaluating Persistent Symptoms (SEPS), health related quality of life, social functioning and medical resource usage. Intention to treat analyses will be carried out with clinical and functioning data, and a cost-utility analysis will compare differences in total costs and differences in quality of life using QALYs derived from the EQ-5D. The data will also be linked to another parallel study in New Zealand where 126 patients with the same inclusion criteria have been treated in a similar trial; the form of analysis of the combined data has yet to be determined. The morbidity and costs of non-cardiac chest pain are substantial and if a simple psychological treatment given by health professionals working in medical departments is beneficial it should prove to be of great value. Combining data with a similar study in New Zealand is an additional asset.

A crucial component of this endeavour has been the development of a Research Agenda to promote engagement with the SCH and STH research and disease control communities by highlighting key questions that could be tackled using data shared through the IDDO platform. Here, we give a contextual overview of the priority research themes articulated in the Research Agenda—a ‘living’ document hosted on the IDDO website—and describe the three-stage consultation process behind its development. We also discuss the sustainability and future directions of the platform, emphasising throughout the power and promise of ethical and equitable sharing and reuse of clinical data to support the elimination of NTDs.</ns4:p>",7,,5,,,,,,Medical Research Council; Research England; Wellcome,,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17468.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17468.1,,,0,000-680-597-055-727; 001-460-465-243-656; 001-526-063-016-708; 001-659-399-993-624; 001-688-176-749-31X; 002-626-501-271-616; 002-701-000-141-626; 002-981-046-435-653; 003-123-309-742-58X; 003-546-150-197-552; 005-209-949-793-385; 006-723-870-838-331; 007-218-935-544-801; 008-301-290-147-924; 008-345-895-678-669; 008-668-346-729-976; 010-036-994-017-279; 010-371-731-398-522; 010-760-815-937-991; 010-911-264-542-533; 011-945-071-316-582; 013-341-535-692-654; 013-851-890-626-539; 014-544-019-348-503; 015-223-241-703-499; 015-305-882-638-286; 015-525-406-752-293; 016-124-769-191-682; 016-542-177-279-877; 017-103-849-940-19X; 017-185-570-189-687; 017-214-977-028-826; 017-344-825-673-40X; 018-120-163-239-375; 018-732-990-131-656; 019-056-499-673-354; 021-520-669-743-174; 022-773-091-494-897; 023-097-073-292-349; 026-013-940-862-484; 026-301-450-503-469; 030-264-962-917-387; 032-457-724-770-870; 033-960-201-193-714; 034-940-145-641-313; 035-843-536-388-580; 036-312-661-618-588; 036-558-895-451-303; 036-568-653-081-353; 037-396-954-869-37X; 038-496-937-546-629; 039-893-884-708-772; 041-777-637-996-117; 043-595-721-243-623; 045-827-143-374-105; 049-565-541-370-570; 049-820-898-440-83X; 051-654-820-616-090; 051-814-854-984-991; 052-062-145-826-680; 053-561-732-436-188; 056-567-898-968-690; 057-963-993-747-520; 058-189-092-685-242; 059-785-229-093-879; 061-139-278-124-155; 063-257-984-514-871; 063-604-821-702-193; 063-665-810-005-279; 065-665-352-093-373; 066-620-224-280-921; 066-951-914-884-024; 067-202-758-474-805; 067-235-854-748-766; 068-012-727-452-40X; 070-694-022-828-57X; 070-977-618-090-932; 073-080-243-412-431; 073-441-671-775-547; 073-963-716-431-827; 074-346-945-176-789; 074-447-789-230-802; 075-449-945-026-981; 077-565-889-091-367; 078-455-717-069-410; 079-960-820-791-229; 082-967-138-302-066; 084-852-855-806-657; 087-045-831-331-229; 089-417-726-458-620; 089-662-499-514-029; 090-316-520-611-880; 096-742-036-084-660; 097-104-537-803-934; 097-364-954-114-815; 098-060-327-308-008; 099-227-199-078-41X; 101-825-240-347-061; 102-239-938-196-642; 102-802-069-447-621; 103-940-951-803-875; 110-147-868-289-908; 111-908-841-154-835; 122-441-746-273-898; 126-871-425-351-950; 127-449-032-650-688; 127-475-283-708-257; 127-567-218-305-599; 144-691-326-706-423; 150-547-218-692-176; 165-814-997-000-922,0

Facelli,"Biomolecular simulations aim to simulate structure, dynamics, interactions, and energetics of complex biomolecular systems. With the recent advances in hardware, it is now possible to use more complex and accurate models, but also reach time scales that are biologically significant. Molecular simulations have become a standard tool for toxicology and pharmacology research, but organizing and sharing data - both within the same organization and among different ones - remains a substantial challenge. In this paper we review our recent work leading to the development of a comprehensive informatics infrastructure to facilitate the organization and exchange of biomolecular simulations data. Our efforts include the design of data models and dictionary tools that allow the standardization of the metadata used to describe the biomedical simulations, the development of a thesaurus and ontology for computational reasoning when searching for biomolecular simulations in distributed environments, and the development of systems based on these models to manage and share the data at a large scale (iBIOMES), and within smaller groups of researchers at laboratory scale (iBIOMES Lite), that take advantage of the standardization of the meta data used to describe biomolecular simulations.",26,7-9,577,593,Controlled vocabulary; Data exchange; Ontology (information science); Standardization; Data science; Thesaurus (information retrieval); Data sharing; Computer science; Data modeling; Metadata,data repositories; data sharing; distributed computing; molecular simulations; ontologies; vocabularies,"Biological Ontologies; Computational Biology/methods; Computer Communication Networks; Computer Simulation; Information Dissemination; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Vocabulary, Controlled",,NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR001067) United States; PHS HHS (1ULTR001067) International; British Heart Foundation United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26387907/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1062936X.2015.1076515 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4672732 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4672732,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1062936x.2015.1076515,26387907,10.1080/1062936x.2015.1076515,2117567290,PMC4672732,0,000-171-783-561-476; 002-748-249-190-683; 005-098-873-461-157; 005-252-792-374-812; 005-315-387-274-178; 006-104-664-386-845; 009-957-742-936-130; 011-536-190-060-439; 018-751-917-600-309; 019-579-098-265-23X; 024-621-867-292-708; 030-630-986-568-027; 032-290-603-046-50X; 034-501-270-053-233; 035-468-627-731-952; 045-996-207-163-321; 050-043-859-734-968; 050-649-404-159-190; 051-033-575-104-240; 051-572-138-713-649; 054-440-494-713-631; 059-357-302-827-12X; 066-287-635-793-768; 066-288-297-673-863; 076-112-187-878-802; 077-632-305-375-129; 085-802-110-863-463; 086-894-214-532-201; 098-467-662-976-18X; 100-380-435-070-247; 100-840-528-972-746; 108-986-261-580-219; 112-824-723-909-078; 113-419-479-604-367; 117-733-952-874-727; 118-829-680-726-941; 125-377-617-574-892; 129-630-278-787-114; 130-094-610-965-12X; 143-360-247-234-015; 177-138-245-414-473; 180-997-669-711-870; 195-099-134-262-597,2

Macleod; Janet Wisely; Iain Chalmers,"Summary After identification of an important research question and selection of an appropriate study design, waste can arise from the regulation, governance, and management of biomedical research. Obtaining regulatory and governance approval has become increasingly burdensome and disproportionate to the conceivable risks to research participants. Regulation and governance involve interventions that are assumed to be justified in the interests of patients and the public, but they can actually compromise these interests. Inefficient management of the procedural conduct of research is wasteful, especially if it results in poor recruitment and retention of participants in well designed studies addressing important questions. These sources of waste can be minimised if the following four recommendations are addressed. First, regulators should use their influence to reduce other causes of waste and inefficiency in research. Second, regulators and policy makers should work with researchers, patients, and health professionals to streamline and harmonise the laws, regulations, guidelines, and processes that govern whether and how research can be done, and ensure that they are proportionate to the plausible risks associated with the research. Third, researchers and research managers should increase the efficiency of recruitment, retention, data monitoring, and data sharing in research through use of research designs known to reduce inefficiencies, and further research should be done to learn how efficiency can be increased. Finally, everyone, particularly those responsible for health-care systems, should promote integration of research into everyday clinical practice. Regulators and researchers should monitor adherence to each of these recommendations and publish metrics.",383,9912,176,185,Environmental resource management; Risk analysis (engineering); Work (electrical); Bioethics; Inefficiency; Research design; Data sharing; Corporate governance; Compromise; Medicine; Identification (information),,Bioethics; Biomedical Research/legislation & jurisprudence; Research Design/standards,,Medical Research Council (G1002605) United Kingdom; Intramural NIH HHS (Z99 AI999999) United States,https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62297-7/fulltext https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/increasing-value-and-reducing-waste-in-biomedical-research-regulation-and-management(ea2d9334-569d-41d0-a4c5-41f72ad9ceea).html https://research.bond.edu.au/en/publications/increasing-value-and-reducing-waste-in-biomedical-research-regula https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/increasing-value-and-reducing-waste-in-biomedical-research-regula https://edc.mazums.ac.ir/Dorsapax/Data/Sub_30/File/WasteValue3.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3952153/ https://www.download.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(13)62297-7.pdf https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/14374254/Increasing_value_and_reducing_waste_in_biomedical_research_regulation_and_management.pdf https://www.weh.ox.ac.uk/publications/448442 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/24411646/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24411646 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673613622977 https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(13)62297-7.pdf http://www.testingtreatments.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/3-Salman-et-al-Paper-3.pdf http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)62297-7/fulltext,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62297-7,24411646,10.1016/s0140-6736(13)62297-7,2087730640,PMC3952153,0,001-230-718-923-710; 002-054-759-769-381; 002-196-452-081-64X; 002-727-097-430-795; 006-166-991-824-21X; 006-742-689-453-799; 006-882-439-273-634; 007-030-874-825-954; 007-058-964-770-218; 007-349-025-870-181; 010-859-257-882-577; 011-930-617-675-148; 012-776-436-687-223; 014-722-929-662-576; 017-115-253-737-957; 017-339-977-258-823; 017-406-485-524-547; 019-987-150-614-760; 020-256-371-343-649; 020-904-147-524-878; 022-436-008-280-883; 022-557-463-600-851; 022-943-762-113-637; 024-747-240-410-989; 024-892-387-396-019; 025-172-707-508-798; 025-297-129-427-396; 025-306-068-912-364; 025-538-856-221-479; 025-835-206-374-36X; 026-515-720-125-095; 028-710-298-553-196; 029-016-683-245-516; 029-784-417-447-213; 035-537-656-339-147; 037-815-368-187-521; 038-311-120-612-894; 039-874-368-738-701; 039-993-501-672-53X; 041-084-885-772-823; 041-410-645-677-991; 041-653-358-591-649; 044-008-961-782-05X; 044-193-364-261-333; 044-575-103-497-472; 047-786-839-419-898; 047-832-069-115-824; 048-129-942-521-643; 048-643-298-383-535; 049-603-708-145-848; 050-935-674-976-737; 051-963-510-272-359; 053-309-449-252-40X; 053-984-901-818-510; 056-657-475-114-932; 058-671-365-419-667; 059-185-628-422-562; 060-322-859-686-323; 061-702-484-547-044; 062-458-977-430-922; 063-968-500-869-483; 064-057-186-078-403; 065-955-389-578-986; 068-863-017-776-317; 070-300-462-027-798; 072-406-399-214-627; 079-687-243-656-646; 081-505-771-691-05X; 085-637-699-713-225; 088-828-613-929-115; 088-983-639-374-592; 089-010-380-299-727; 091-873-680-269-883; 097-730-729-411-335; 098-045-266-934-236; 100-360-919-947-609; 102-152-404-408-354; 102-366-373-328-688; 105-686-353-734-445; 106-376-265-733-322; 107-331-324-402-476; 107-912-355-096-868; 110-199-472-178-413; 110-843-398-046-184; 113-875-005-206-825; 117-909-441-045-800; 120-699-369-941-955; 121-817-780-430-750; 124-346-454-498-953; 132-801-945-892-826; 138-259-859-390-898; 144-717-474-916-88X; 151-048-766-958-705; 151-778-226-229-346; 167-006-102-767-637; 189-145-278-705-681,315

Alongside this there has been growing interest in the public acceptability of data sharing and data linkage practices. Public acceptance is recognised as crucial for ensuring the legitimacy of current practices and systems of governance. Given the growing international interest in this area this systematic review and thematic synthesis represents a timely review of current evidence. It highlights the key factors influencing public responses as well as important areas for further research. This paper reports a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies examining public attitudes towards the sharing or linkage of health data for research purposes. Twenty-five studies were included in the review. The included studies were conducted primarily in the UK and North America, with one study set in Japan, another in Sweden and one in multiple countries. The included studies were conducted between 1999 and 2013 (eight studies selected for inclusion did not report data collection dates). The qualitative methods represented in the studies included focus groups, interviews, deliberative events, dialogue workshops and asynchronous online interviews. Key themes identified across the corpus of studies related to the conditions necessary for public support/acceptability, areas of public concern and implications for future research. The results identify a growing body of evidence pointing towards widespread general—though conditional—support for data linkage and data sharing for research purposes. Whilst a variety of concerns were raised (e.g. relating to confidentiality, individuals’ control over their data, uses and abuses of data and potential harms arising) in cases where participants perceived there to be actual or potential public benefits from research and had trust in the individuals or organisations conducting and/or overseeing data linkage/sharing, they were generally supportive. The studies also find current low levels of awareness about existing practices and uses of data. Whilst the results indicate widespread (conditional) public support for data sharing and linkage for research purposes, a range of concerns exist. In order to ensure public support for future research uses of data greater awareness raising combined with opportunities for public engagement and deliberation are needed. This will be essential for ensuring the legitimacy of future health informatics research and avoiding further public controversy.",17,1,73,73,Philosophy of medicine; Data collection; Public opinion; Health informatics; Qualitative research; Public engagement; Data sharing; Public relations; Management science; Focus group; Medicine,Data linkage; Data sharing; Health informatics; Public engagement,Attitude; Biomedical Research/ethics; Data Collection; Humans; Information Dissemination; Medical Records; Public Opinion,,British Heart Foundation United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M501633/2) United Kingdom; Arthritis Research UK United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_PC_13040) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Chief Scientist Office United Kingdom,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27832780 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-016-0153-x/fulltext.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5103425/ https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/28892872/art_3A10.1186_2Fs12910_016_0153_x.pdf https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0153-x https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/public-responses-to-the-sharing-and-linkage-of-health-data-for-re https://core.ac.uk/display/77047765 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-016-0153-x/email/correspondent/c1/new https://philpapers.org/rec/AITPRT https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/public-responses-to-the-sharing-and-linkage-of-health-data-for-research-purposes-a-systematic-review-and-thematic-synthesis-of-qualitative-studies(3084133d-1c21-449d-b58c-9441f216d733).html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27832780/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12910-016-0153-x.pdf https://0-bmcmedethics-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/s12910-016-0153-x https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/254088 https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/254088 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5103425 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs12910-016-0153-x https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/28892872/art_3A10.1186_2Fs12910_016_0153_x.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/77047765.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-016-0153-x,27832780,10.1186/s12910-016-0153-x,2551792675,PMC5103425,0,002-380-648-252-439; 007-262-598-222-083; 007-356-542-613-947; 011-071-337-623-412; 011-569-487-815-661; 015-575-281-280-864; 015-840-390-184-083; 016-607-664-360-351; 018-297-993-114-727; 019-144-001-711-844; 020-371-358-939-038; 022-462-083-682-339; 025-152-909-365-037; 026-660-373-171-062; 035-461-260-596-050; 037-622-957-634-253; 038-309-113-387-411; 040-263-184-562-441; 041-702-894-477-186; 051-813-139-759-539; 061-579-033-155-884; 062-720-464-027-725; 064-491-776-621-447; 067-094-485-744-383; 070-849-475-528-434; 070-922-796-053-693; 080-575-616-360-792; 105-386-024-956-827; 105-930-045-721-214; 111-163-818-477-43X; 128-205-371-614-214; 175-337-412-540-24X; 194-997-123-405-829; 195-402-580-191-329,145

Scharlemann; Andy Purvis,"Biodiversity continues to decline in the face of increasing anthropogenic pressures such as habitat destruction, exploitation, pollution and introduction of alien species. Existing global databases of species’ threat status or population time series are dominated by charismatic species. The collation of datasets with broad taxonomic and biogeographic extents, and that support computation of a range of biodiversity indicators, is necessary to enable better understanding of historical declines and to project – and avert – future declines. We describe and assess a new database of more than 1.6 million samples from 78 countries representing over 28,000 species, collated from existing spatial comparisons of local-scale biodiversity exposed to different intensities and types of anthropogenic pressures, from terrestrial sites around the world. The database contains measurements taken in 208 (of 814) ecoregions, 13 (of 14) biomes, 25 (of 35) biodiversity hotspots and 16 (of 17) megadiverse countries. The database contains more than 1% of the total number of all species described, and more than 1% of the described species within many taxonomic groups – including flowering plants, gymnosperms, birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, beetles, lepidopterans and hymenopterans. The dataset, which is still being added to, is therefore already considerably larger and more representative than those used by previous quantitative models of biodiversity trends and responses. The database is being assembled as part of the PREDICTS project (Projecting Responses of Ecological Diversity In Changing Terrestrial Systems – www.predicts.org.uk). We make site-level summary data available alongside this article. The full database will be publicly available in 2015.",4,24,4701,4735,Biodiversity; Biodiversity hotspot; Ecosystem diversity; Habitat; Ecology; Population; Habitat destruction; Megadiverse countries;

Materials & methods: A total of 224 Costa Rican individuals answered the anonymous online survey 'Your DNA, Your Say'. It covers attitudes toward DNA and medical data donation, trust in research professionals and concerns about consequences of reidentification. Results & conclusion: Most individuals (89%) are willing to donate their information for research purposes. When confronted with different potential uses of their data, participants are significantly less likely to donate data to for-profit researchers (34% willingness to donate). The most frequently cited concerns regarding donation of genetic data relate to possible discrimination by health/life insurance companies and employers. For the participants in the survey, the most trusted professionals are their own medical doctor and nonprofit researchers from their country. This is the first study regarding attitudes toward genetic data donation in Costa Rica.",18,2,141,152,Psychology; Donation; Data sharing; Genetic data; Medical doctor; Life insurance; Family medicine,attitudes; data sharing; donation; genomics; survey,Adult; Attitude/ethnology; Biological Specimen Banks; Confidentiality; Costa Rica; DNA/analysis; Female; Humans; Information Dissemination; Male; Middle Aged; Sociodemographic Factors,DNA,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (206194) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8010325/ https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8010325,http://dx.doi.org/10.2217/pme-2020-0113,33576268,10.2217/pme-2020-0113,3129033276,PMC8010325,0,000-541-435-302-414; 001-610-630-749-994; 002-233-715-333-627; 002-637-506-591-946; 003-478-316-137-372; 003-696-590-250-322; 004-327-571-567-853; 006-139-383-629-214; 006-433-643-653-112; 007-406-314-592-593; 010-232-055-736-062; 011-164-146-144-323; 011-998-930-525-702; 016-513-542-264-372; 023-305-881-396-027; 023-631-464-491-940; 025-456-891-173-338; 026-166-680-227-173; 032-341-799-731-396; 033-182-046-119-064; 034-432-752-164-95X; 036-648-538-053-007; 037-312-823-596-489; 039-309-388-213-812; 040-322-374-348-064; 042-558-635-197-000; 043-614-388-024-283; 044-304-494-594-506; 046-029-175-949-196; 048-465-576-777-042; 054-778-926-965-153; 054-805-864-347-560; 061-821-496-682-034; 066-823-183-543-43X; 073-693-472-209-439; 075-465-734-221-082; 076-382-741-152-081; 080-596-755-380-606; 085-919-700-879-544; 114-658-000-212-025; 115-518-669-480-656; 123-510-343-483-850; 124-678-686-533-982; 125-810-717-283-966; 135-750-746-451-261; 138-979-644-672-05X; 159-485-857-843-520,2

One significant gap in literature around data sharing concerns how it impacts on scientists’ ability to preserve values and ethical standards that form an essential component of scientific collaborations. We conducted a qualitative sociological study examining the potential for harm to ethnic groups, and implications of such ethical concerns for data sharing. We focused our empirical work on the MalariaGEN Consortium, one of the first international collaborative genomics research projects in Africa. Methods: We conducted a study in three MalariaGEN project sites in Kenya, the Gambia, and the United Kingdom. The study entailed analysis of project documents and 49 semi-structured interviews with fieldworkers, researchers and ethics committee members. Results: Concerns about how best to address the potential for harm to ethnic groups in MalariaGEN crystallised in discussions about the development of a data sharing policy. Particularly concerning for researchers was how best to manage the sharing of genomic data outside of the original collaboration. Within MalariaGEN, genomic data is accompanied by information about the locations of sample collection, the limitations of consent and ethics approval, and the values and relations that accompanied sample collection. For interviewees, this information and context were of important ethical value in safeguarding against harmful uses of data, but is not customarily shared with secondary data users. This challenged the ability of primary researchers to protect against harmful uses of ‘their’ data. Conclusion: We identified three protective mechanisms – trust, the existence of a shared morality, and detailed contextual understanding – which together might play an important role in preventing the use of genomic data in ways that could harm the ethnic groups included in the study. We suggest that the current practice of sharing of datasets as isolated objects rather than as embedded within a particular scientific culture, without regard for the normative context within which samples were collected, may cause ethical tensions to emerge that could have been prevented or addressed had the ‘ethical metadata’ that accompanies genomic data also been shared.",15,1,62,62,Philosophy of medicine; Sociology; Qualitative research; Safeguarding; Harm; Data sharing; Context (language use); Sample collection; Social science; Public relations; Metadata,,"Blacks/genetics; Cooperative Behavior; Ethics, Research; Ethnicity; Gambia; Genetic Research/ethics; Genomics/ethics; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Informed Consent; Kenya; Malaria/genetics; Moral Obligations; Qualitative Research; Research Personnel; Risk; Trust; United Kingdom",,Wellcome Trust (WT076934/Z/05/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (090770/Z/09/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT077383/Z/05/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (090532) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G19/9) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (090770) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT087285) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UP_A900_1118) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT083326) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (091758) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT096527) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0600718) United Kingdom,https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/484438 https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6939-15-62 https://core.ac.uk/display/81050075 https://philpapers.org/rec/DEVKWT https://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6939/15/62 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2F1472-6939-15-62 https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/484438 https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/17831 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25124199 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25124199/ https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/bitstream/10044/1/17831/2/de%20vries_J_2014_knowing%20who%20to%20trust.pdf https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/484438 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1472-6939-15-62.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4146449,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6939-15-62,25124199,10.1186/1472-6939-15-62,2022124525,PMC4146449,0,001-624-916-522-59X; 005-737-734-442-333; 006-252-946-689-03X; 006-957-645-849-562; 007-093-385-127-547; 010-573-184-794-352; 014-289-125-335-495; 022-414-673-333-984; 024-842-789-549-449; 025-456-891-173-338; 027-118-372-561-372; 027-610-501-516-151; 034-226-623-297-644; 034-483-692-850-578; 036-138-099-943-445; 038-157-414-709-63X; 038-824-642-263-293; 043-238-582-252-339; 043-461-666-754-223; 053-104-894-373-278; 057-254-747-112-851; 058-158-748-000-110; 062-585-169-709-02X; 063-147-671-886-001; 071-045-433-017-68X; 072-262-714-849-607; 080-596-755-380-606; 081-428-370-569-495; 082-785-813-453-005; 097-043-255-374-039; 102-417-952-014-584; 108-742-389-231-383; 117-883-108-528-099; 127-504-065-488-903; 156-541-739-565-077; 180-187-323-068-908; 188-270-297-190-317,13

Local government plays a key role in influencing these wider determinants of health and levels of inequality within their communities. However, they lack the research infrastructure and culture that would enable them to develop an evidence-based approach to tackling the complex drivers of those conditions. Methods: We undertook a scoping project to explore the potential for, and what would be needed to develop a local authority research system for the City of Bradford, UK. This included identifying the current research landscape and any barriers and enablers to research activity within the local authority using qualitative individual and focus group interviews, a rapid review of existing local research system models, scoping of the use of evidence in decision making and training opportunities and existing support for local government research. Results: We identified four key themes important to developing and sustaining a research system: leadership, resource and capacity, culture, partnerships. Some use of research in decision making was evident but research training opportunities within the local authority were limited. Health research funders are slowly adapting to the local government environment, but this remains limited and more work is needed to shift the centre of gravity towards public health, local government and the community more generally.  Conclusions: We propose a model for a local authority research system that can guide the development of an exemplar whole system research framework that includes research infrastructure, data sharing, research training and skills, and co-production with local partners, to choose, use, generate, and deliver research in local government.",6,,276,,Public policy; Public health; Conceptual framework; Business; Local government; Data sharing; Public relations; Resource (project management); Focus group; Social determinants of health,,,,NIHR; NIHR Clinical Research Network; UK Prevention Research Partnership,https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-276 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-276/v1/xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17195.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.17195.1,3205922833,,0,021-945-599-402-473; 036-165-099-423-072; 044-293-113-134-880; 115-847-548-507-397,0

Bowring; George E. Gehrels,"The past 15 years have produced numerous innovations in geochronology, including experimental methods, instrumentation, and software that are revolutionizing the acquisition and application of geochronological data. For example, exciting advances are being driven by Laser-Ablation ICP Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), which allows for rapid determination of U-Th-Pb ages with 10s of micrometer-scale spatial resolution. This method has become the most commonly applied tool for dating zircons, constraining a host of geological problems. The LA-ICPMS community is now faced with archiving these data with associated analytical results and, more importantly, ensuring that data meet the highest standards for precision and accuracy and that interlaboratory biases are minimized. However, there is little consensus with regard to analytical strategies and data reduction protocols for LA-ICPMS geochronology. The result is systematic interlaboratory bias and both underestimation and overestimation of uncertainties on calculated dates that, in turn, decrease the value of data in repositories such as EarthChem, which archives data and analytical results from participating laboratories. We present free open-source software that implements new algorithms for evaluating and resolving many of these discrepancies. This solution is the result of a collaborative effort to extend the U-Pb_Redux software for the ID-TIMS community to the LA-ICPMS community. Now named ET_Redux, our new software automates the analytical and scientific workflows of data acquisition, statistical filtering, data analysis and interpretation, publication, community-based archiving, and the compilation and comparison of data from different laboratories to support collaborative science.",17,7,2480,2496,Algorithm; Instrumentation (computer programming); Geology; Data reduction; Data acquisition; Workflow; Host (network); Cyberinfrastructure; Redux; Software,,,,NSF; NERC,https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/1808/23900/1/McLean_2016.pdf https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/algorithms-and-software-for-u-pb-geochronology-by-la-icpms https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015GC006097 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016GGG....17.2480M/abstract https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/23900 https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GC006097,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2015gc006097,,10.1002/2015gc006097,2290480795,,0,006-322-933-987-194; 012-848-941-681-906; 014-235-210-279-48X; 018-957-483-302-577; 023-659-728-918-413; 028-992-639-756-572; 032-849-378-813-032; 056-646-688-344-842; 058-246-044-511-596; 062-042-420-517-714; 063-950-940-829-228; 065-914-060-028-582; 070-807-520-195-398; 072-602-529-874-665; 074-924-193-925-477; 096-313-726-552-235; 104-899-461-214-992; 105-661-645-474-584; 110-117-114-556-769; 113-068-372-445-886; 118-007-822-370-977; 119-205-750-263-040; 123-973-033-477-085; 128-856-080-540-728; 135-437-891-969-779; 139-926-481-849-283; 140-799-105-261-546; 170-683-986-771-944,14

Grefenstette; Richard Wilder; Abraham J Herbst; David L Heymann; Donald S. Burke,"Background: In the current information age, the use of data has become essential for decision making in public health at the local, national, and global level. Despite a global commitment to the use and sharing of public health data, this can be challenging in reality. No systematic framework or global operational guidelines have been created for data sharing in public health. Barriers at different levels have limited data sharing but have only been anecdotally discussed or in the context of specific case studies. Incomplete systematic evidence on the scope and variety of these barriers has limited opportunities to maximize the value and use of public health data for science and policy. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of potential barriers to public health data sharing. Documents that described barriers to sharing of routinely collected public health data were eligible for inclusion and reviewed independently by a team of experts. We grouped identified barriers in a taxonomy for a focused international dialogue on solutions. Results: Twenty potential barriers were identified and classified in six categories: technical, motivational, economic, political, legal and ethical. The first three categories are deeply rooted in well-known challenges of health information systems for which structural solutions have yet to be found; the last three have solutions that lie in an international dialogue aimed at generating consensus on policies and instruments for data sharing. Conclusions: The simultaneous effect of multiple interacting barriers ranging from technical to intangible issues has greatly complicated advances in public health data sharing. A systematic framework of barriers to data sharing in public health will be essential to accelerate the use of valuable information for the global good.",14,1,1144,1144,Public health informatics; Public health; Health informatics; Health promotion; International health; Data sharing; Global health; Health policy; Knowledge management; Medicine; Environmental health,,Communication Barriers; Global Health; Humans; Information Dissemination; Public Health,,Wellcome Trust (097410) United Kingdom; NIGMS NIH HHS (U54 GM088491) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (5U54GM088491) United States,http://www.immregistries.org/Review_of_Barriers_to_Data_Sharing.pdf https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4649573/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1471-2458-14-1144.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/81786039 https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1144 https://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/14/1144/prepub http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4239377 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1144 http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/29474/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25377061 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/25377061 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/a-systematic-review-of-barriers-to-data-sharing-in-public-health https://paperity.org/p/57246588/a-systematic-review-of-barriers-to-data-sharing-in-public-health https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25377061/ https://core.ac.uk/download/161536202.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1144,25377061,10.1186/1471-2458-14-1144,2123737882,PMC4239377,0,000-004-442-809-076; 001-775-042-221-291; 002-344-942-047-315; 002-380-648-252-439; 005-471-522-638-267; 008-216-774-533-630; 009-650-429-901-998; 010-235-036-060-558; 010-725-852-213-93X; 011-099-212-389-081; 012-132-981-329-591; 012-478-078-934-670; 013-291-818-770-111; 017-300-737-144-757; 017-686-568-938-402; 018-039-388-549-288; 023-154-864-067-701; 024-451-002-112-916; 025-561-175-926-92X; 030-691-175-628-056; 031-632-897-867-725; 032-505-688-261-721; 033-951-082-849-068; 035-327-051-087-500; 035-911-016-512-295; 036-085-654-947-992; 036-805-720-420-64X; 038-157-414-709-63X; 038-824-642-263-293; 039-147-434-883-931; 039-417-341-233-398; 041-489-944-656-87X; 043-608-798-344-369; 044-230-020-749-669; 045-341-195-177-955; 046-921-589-054-795; 048-783-744-047-107; 050-270-083-621-412; 050-379-212-786-950; 050-757-730-347-179; 053-000-285-639-329; 053-240-557-552-263; 054-298-888-014-505; 058-923-618-930-227; 059-186-199-769-705; 061-733-111-304-340; 062-213-533-435-946; 067-410-911-411-904; 070-795-330-421-977; 070-970-822-952-69X; 074-454-752-409-898; 076-209-882-257-611; 078-209-127-067-665; 080-716-525-747-760; 084-817-941-127-921; 085-409-683-375-511; 090-765-762-508-062; 092-015-461-779-328; 102-722-669-293-179; 105-112-042-095-110; 113-590-814-920-747; 118-085-022-435-430; 128-741-065-597-54X; 131-175-164-703-349; 142-409-126-502-317; 157-259-916-022-40X; 167-829-131-059-784; 171-689-443-321-940; 177-309-906-869-509,211

To maximize the value of the genomic data generated, these data will need to be shared between institutions and across countries. In recognition of this challenge, 21 European countries recently signed a declaration to transnationally share data on at least 1 million human genomes by 2022. In this Roadmap, we identify the challenges of data sharing across borders and demonstrate that European research infrastructures are well-positioned to support the rapid implementation of widespread genomic data access.",20,11,693,701,Declaration; Health care; Precision medicine; Genomics; Human genome; Data science; Data sharing; Human genomics; Big data; Biology,,"Biomedical Research; Europe; Genome, Human; Human Genome Project; Humans",,Wellcome Trust (201535) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (201535/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0156-9.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31455890 https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/207290 https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/leveraging-european-european-infrastructures-to-access-1-million-human-genomes-by-2022(0064e76b-2aba-481d-b061-9b7b56b44c77).html https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0156-9 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7115898 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/184969/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31455890 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-019-0156-9.epdf?shared_access_token=X3pSjtbhCvtr4WPS6hVkb9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0O_vPzwLzPkZ4JB1ag7XU7SmlqUR43Ln5t0mMiyjXxP383tuvrUcxySQeOiAnPIptiw2ObyBEsMXZOqsCCdYfy7uauWuuKVNVqPfhrHNBMciA%3D%3D https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/leveraging-european-infrastructures-to-access-1-million-human-gen https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2F8d0452af-7c7b-45a4-81c4-9e0e2c5dc37d https://www.muni.cz/vyzkum/publikace/1550920 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/31455890,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41576-019-0156-9,31455890,10.1038/s41576-019-0156-9,2971177113,PMC7115898,0,000-122-428-211-630; 001-508-468-325-630; 006-986-308-098-369; 007-416-224-155-700; 011-739-818-209-420; 015-798-180-965-897; 019-850-338-034-47X; 020-058-758-918-171; 024-975-795-321-538; 030-307-018-489-751; 033-196-841-157-972; 036-148-257-435-606; 072-318-773-202-408; 077-958-767-002-917; 094-381-625-194-127; 098-370-954-400-915; 104-067-486-297-809; 105-826-591-189-43X,36

There are many efforts underway to encourage data sharing and reuse, from scientific publishers asking authors to submit data alongside manuscripts to data marketplaces, open data portals and data communities. Google recently beta-released a search service for datasets, which allows users to discover data stored in various online repositories via keyword queries. These developments foreshadow an emerging research field around dataset search or retrieval that broadly encompasses frameworks, methods and tools that help match a user data need against a collection of datasets. Here, we survey the state of the art of research and commercial systems and discuss what makes dataset search a field in its own right, with unique challenges and open questions. We look at approaches and implementations from related areas dataset search is drawing upon, including information retrieval, databases, entity-centric and tabular search in order to identify possible paths to tackle these questions as well as immediate next steps that will take the field forward.",29,1,251,272,Reuse;

This necessitates the transfer of experimental information between research groups, as well as potentially to publishers and funders. After the initial efforts of the metabolomics standards initiative, minimum reporting standards were proposed which included the concepts for metabolomics databases. Built by the community, standards and infrastructure for metabolomics are still needed to allow storage, exchange, comparison and re-utilization of metabolomics data. The Framework Programme 7 EU Initiative ‘coordination of standards in metabolomics’ (COSMOS) is developing a robust data infrastructure and exchange standards for metabolomics data and metadata. This is to support workflows for a broad range of metabolomics applications within the European metabolomics community and the wider metabolomics and biomedical communities’ participation. Here we announce our concepts and efforts asking for re-engagement of the metabolomics community, academics and industry, journal publishers, software and hardware vendors, as well as those interested in standardisation worldwide (addressing missing metabolomics ontologies, complex-metadata capturing and XML based open source data exchange format), to join and work towards updating and implementing metabolomics standards.",11,6,1587,1597,Data exchange; Workflow; Metabolomics; Data science; Research groups; Open source data; Metabolomics data; Environmental science; XML; Metadata,Coordination and data sharing community; Data exchange; Data standards; Metabolomics; Metabonomics; e-Infrastructure,,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/D006422/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000933/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/C519038/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/I000771/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UP_A090_1006) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/E025080/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_QA137293) United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26491418/ https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01165673/document https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-015-0810-y https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/coordination-of-standards-in-metabolomics-cosmos(71b1730b-95c0-45b9-aa2a-9ff235504625)/export.html https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01165673 http://oru.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1169271 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11306-015-0810-y.pdf https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A2916204/view http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2227263 https://paperity.org/p/73032904/coordination-of-standards-in-metabolomics-cosmos-facilitating-integrated-metabolomics https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/files/25244208/Steinbeck_et_al_COordination_of_Standards_Metabolomics_2015.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4605977/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4605977 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Atudelft.nl%3Auuid%3A511f9661-ea6f-46b0-a845-1f6bb072937f https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2227263 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1169271 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11306-015-0810-y/fulltext.html https://repository.tudelft.nl/view/tno/uuid%3A511f9661-ea6f-46b0-a845-1f6bb072937f/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/26491418/ https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/handle/1887/56319/ https://core.ac.uk/display/77457206 https://usir.salford.ac.uk/id/eprint/41356/ https://repository.tno.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A511f9661-ea6f-46b0-a845-1f6bb072937f,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11306-015-0810-y,26491418,10.1007/s11306-015-0810-y,2128831025,PMC4605977,0,003-046-498-462-846; 005-161-947-154-117; 006-960-029-135-301; 007-237-308-227-616; 009-764-085-540-142; 010-058-876-284-39X; 011-545-777-034-955; 015-648-955-081-381; 015-822-842-099-076; 016-566-535-787-756; 019-438-979-851-475; 019-804-570-233-329; 020-795-594-369-056; 021-196-281-153-539; 022-940-313-039-79X; 024-386-277-536-955; 027-432-061-970-430; 027-823-762-689-914; 029-454-450-113-627; 030-252-742-431-440; 033-607-237-175-094; 039-783-700-856-256; 040-411-819-739-135; 045-477-787-830-99X; 047-274-386-089-953; 047-374-231-482-273; 047-938-888-461-013; 048-396-540-107-454; 049-012-654-002-459; 049-698-939-529-843; 050-235-705-444-585; 051-548-594-606-353; 054-533-078-313-244; 055-030-418-047-31X; 055-194-067-578-936; 056-077-661-392-564; 056-552-829-431-53X; 061-457-021-287-163; 061-463-664-308-862; 062-117-643-599-810; 062-750-415-962-191; 067-760-921-520-071; 072-371-216-006-36X; 075-371-277-491-468; 077-095-626-813-563; 078-668-160-251-766; 080-427-230-464-527; 082-730-242-636-132; 083-085-686-198-572; 084-213-185-304-701; 085-882-395-201-561; 086-287-166-237-456; 091-206-891-622-676; 092-518-663-349-873; 094-599-179-217-924; 094-663-394-363-581; 097-515-968-369-734; 097-736-372-922-34X; 099-716-010-084-128; 102-785-431-660-192; 106-854-761-667-858; 113-509-870-741-400; 113-906-698-904-464; 114-516-802-634-429; 116-359-704-366-674; 118-811-026-762-432; 125-747-231-124-608; 126-126-371-693-17X; 128-825-361-826-384; 136-813-589-873-090; 141-385-908-483-720; 148-931-536-914-891; 151-196-602-903-702; 160-061-737-284-265; 169-779-811-478-552; 183-022-769-808-433,101

Hills,"There are well-understood psychological limits on our capacity to process information. As information proliferation-the consumption and sharing of information-increases through social media and other communications technology, these limits create an attentional bottleneck, favoring information that is more likely to be searched for, attended to, comprehended, encoded, and later reproduced. In information-rich environments, this bottleneck influences the evolution of information via four forces of cognitive selection, selecting for information that is belief-consistent, negative, social, and predictive. Selection for belief-consistent information leads balanced information to support increasingly polarized views. Selection for negative information amplifies information about downside risks and crowds out potential benefits. Selection for social information drives herding, impairs objective assessments, and reduces exploration for solutions to hard problems. Selection for predictive patterns drives overfitting, the replication crisis, and risk seeking. This article summarizes the negative implications of these forces of cognitive selection and presents eight warnings that represent severe pitfalls for the naive ""informavore,"" accelerating extremism, hysteria, herding, and the proliferation of misinformation.",14,3,323,330,Herding; Cognitive psychology; Misinformation; Crowds; Replication crisis; Social proof; Bottleneck; Computer science; Information and Communications Technology; Selection (genetic algorithm),attention economics; evolution; misinformation; social proof; social risk amplification,"Attention; Cognition; Communication; Humans; Information Theory; Psychology, Social; Social Media",,Royal Society; Alan Turing Institute,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691618803647 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691618803647 https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/107624/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496691/ http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/30496691 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30496691/ https://core.ac.uk/download/161124824.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1745691618803647,30496691,10.1177/1745691618803647,2894604123,,0,000-089-309-331-785; 003-298-765-382-535; 004-722-629-203-770; 006-205-232-760-365; 007-316-623-506-709; 007-956-999-130-522; 009-006-863-742-515; 011-692-551-965-634; 012-146-970-165-912; 012-723-709-022-94X; 017-136-248-684-232; 017-900-752-312-535; 018-088-031-126-38X; 018-259-337-688-581; 018-508-323-569-068; 018-658-066-225-195; 019-331-430-327-553; 021-800-982-276-708; 024-678-108-582-461; 025-271-384-564-536; 025-810-470-913-763; 026-355-520-323-695; 026-419-799-073-776; 026-521-148-724-935; 026-991-400-650-47X; 027-682-619-666-545; 028-690-407-787-114; 029-421-762-723-757; 029-995-447-784-974; 030-759-038-580-381; 032-171-144-152-001; 033-322-703-798-143; 035-275-768-016-732; 037-196-674-258-316; 037-529-520-421-70X; 038-328-596-668-683; 038-645-901-974-708; 039-252-978-602-581; 040-647-520-053-076; 042-490-662-653-640; 044-371-330-772-142; 045-809-757-447-947; 047-406-153-859-170; 047-767-246-505-64X; 049-898-881-273-510; 050-849-474-729-845; 054-938-373-448-403; 055-807-088-113-125; 056-780-104-269-525; 057-775-529-712-246; 058-505-707-925-671; 059-810-591-959-956; 060-210-905-439-467; 060-761-646-368-123; 061-646-630-453-211; 068-661-269-337-622; 069-148-903-024-455; 069-656-057-309-187; 069-974-295-886-784; 074-582-312-220-14X; 075-044-286-828-01X; 077-313-244-809-481; 077-617-038-894-358; 078-782-810-370-169; 079-809-291-208-445; 081-510-992-011-309; 081-768-597-784-22X; 082-156-291-170-355; 086-993-701-614-697; 087-047-492-734-961; 091-142-984-118-233; 093-872-826-713-683; 098-950-277-295-601; 110-671-025-667-203; 111-059-850-016-30X; 111-916-631-163-266; 113-965-123-855-956; 117-026-846-420-702; 120-278-781-819-403; 120-639-784-215-286; 121-772-497-159-778; 125-580-693-990-699; 127-893-118-436-202; 128-641-680-547-730; 134-875-812-537-518; 154-677-497-579-010; 155-432-542-159-789; 175-377-335-056-177; 196-777-059-955-380,48
4882,088-603-000-149-32X,A balance of trust in the use of government administrative data,2017-10-10,2017,journal article,Archival Science,13890166; 15737519,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Netherlands,Anna Sexton; Elizabeth Shepherd; Oliver Duke-Williams; Alexandra Eveleigh,"Government departments and agencies around the world routinely collect administrative data produced by citizen interaction with the state. The UK government increasingly frames data as an ‘asset’. The potential in administrative data can be exploited by sharing and linking across datasets, but when the rhetoric of the benefits of data sharing is bound up in commercial exploitation, trustworthy motivations for sharing data come into question. Such questions are framed around two apparently conflicting public goods. The public good in re-using data to increase government efficiency and to enhance research is set against the public good in protecting privacy. Privacy is a collective as well as an individual benefit, enabling the public to participate confidently in citizen-state interactions. Balancing these public goods is challenging given rapidly evolving technology and data science. The analysis presented here draws on research undertaken by the authors as part of the Administrative Data Research Centre in England. Between 2014 and 2017, four case studies were conducted on government administrative data across education, transport, energy and health. The purpose of the research was to examine stakeholder perspectives in relation to administrative data sharing and re-use. The themes of trust, risk and consent were chosen to articulate the research questions and analysis: this article focuses on the findings related to trust. It explores the notion of trust in the collection, analysis, linkage and re-use of routinely collected government administrative data in England. It seeks to demonstrate that securing public trust in data initiatives is dependent on a broader balance of trust between a network of actors involved in data sharing and use.",17,4,305,330,Rhetoric; Business; Government; Public good; Stakeholder; Relation (database); State (polity); Public trust; Data sharing; Public relations,,,,Economic and Social Research Council,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10502-017-9281-4 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10024711/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10502-017-9281-4.pdf http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10024711/ https://core.ac.uk/display/111077939 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/111077939.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10502-017-9281-4,,10.1007/s10502-017-9281-4,2762264524,,0,012-698-847-860-907; 021-719-302-615-035; 024-887-616-111-763; 025-431-181-473-466; 027-933-384-725-849; 028-522-923-354-988; 029-669-403-413-991; 030-305-706-347-985; 030-980-229-168-894; 034-909-429-813-134; 035-816-249-811-91X; 037-873-190-793-350; 042-621-755-953-711; 047-671-195-740-490; 054-268-565-502-005; 057-655-072-688-20X; 064-242-579-343-030; 066-279-383-317-406; 073-945-795-012-620; 075-129-083-536-095; 078-249-789-490-901; 079-592-780-442-748; 083-867-286-911-881; 090-156-560-538-913; 094-687-272-202-815; 105-054-242-343-497; 111-389-890-923-942; 123-882-929-213-847; 138-893-057-729-819; 139-033-441-794-355; 145-026-398-023-505; 162-725-859-796-180; 170-503-478-469-019; 194-149-788-700-548,13

FHE allows for the arbitrary depth computation of both addition and multiplication, and thus the application of abelian/polynomial equations, like those found in deep learning algorithms. This project investigates how FHE with deep learning can be used at scale toward accurate sequence prediction, with a relatively low time complexity, the problems that such a system incurs, and mitigations/solutions for such problems. In addition, we discuss how this could have an impact on the future of data privacy and how it can enable data sharing across various actors in the agri-food supply chain, hence allowing the development of machine learning-based systems. Finally, we find that although FHE incurs a high spatial complexity cost, the run time is within expected reasonable bounds, while allowing for absolutely private predictions to be made, in our case for milk yield prediction with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 12.4% and an accuracy of 87.6% on average.",3,4,819,834,Deep learning; Computer engineering; Information privacy; Encryption; Mean absolute percentage error; Artificial intelligence; Multiplication; Homomorphic encryption; Time complexity; Computer science; Polynomial,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12997 http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/17352/1/Onoufriou_etal_MLKE_Fully_Homomorphically_Encrypted_VoR.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12997 https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/3/4/41/xml https://pure.sruc.ac.uk/en/publications/fully-homomorphically-encrypted-deep-learning-as-a-service https://www.mdpi.com/2504-4990/3/4/41 https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/fully-homomorphically-encrypted-deep-learning-as-a-service https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2107.html#abs-2107-12997 https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/17352,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/make3040041,,10.3390/make3040041,3207393900,,0,007-117-184-557-253; 040-347-413-176-471; 098-689-940-646-185; 138-523-192-131-563; 139-788-758-020-230; 159-261-186-739-390; 178-790-916-010-01X,2

Tangwa,"During public health emergencies (PHEs), data are collected and generated from a variety of activities and sources, including but not limited to national public health programs, research and community-based activities. It is critical that these data are rapidly shared in order to facilitate the public health response, epidemic preparedness, as well research during and after the epidemic. Nonetheless, collecting and sharing data during PHEs can be challenging, especially where there are limited resources for public health and research-related activities during a PHE. In a symposium that brought together different stakeholders that were involved in the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreaks in West Africa, meeting attendees shared their perspectives on the values and management of data during PHEs in sub-Saharan Africa. Key factors that could inform and facilitate data management during PHEs in sub-Saharan Africa were discussed, including using data to inform policy decisions and healthcare; a coordinated data collection and management scheme; identifying incentives for data sharing; and equitable data  governance mechanism that emphasise principles of reciprocity, transparency and accountability rather that trust between stakeholders or collaborators. Empirical studies are required to explore how these principles could inform best practices for data management and governance during PHE in sub-Saharan Africa.",6,,11,,Public health; Business; Health care; Data management; Best practice; Accountability; Preparedness; Data sharing; Transparency (behavior); Public relations,,,,"Wellcome Trust; Department for International Development, UK Government",https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4659484/ https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-11 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-11/v1/xml https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR273089,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16494.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16494.1,3123589339,,0,005-637-499-969-670; 008-933-418-211-119; 011-613-162-652-791; 012-796-093-198-628; 014-756-944-023-161; 015-582-573-942-829; 016-267-593-890-591; 026-052-410-437-079; 028-031-533-669-566; 084-211-184-614-987; 101-659-463-464-328,1

This scoping review of empirical research and conceptual literature examined stakeholders’ perspectives of ethical best practices in data sharing, particularly in low- and middle-income settings. Sixty-nine empirical and conceptual articles were reviewed, of which, only five were empirical studies and eight were conceptual articles focusing on low- and middle-income settings. We conclude that support for sharing individual-level data is contingent on the development and implementation of international and local policies and processes to support ethical best practices. Further conceptual and empirical research is needed to ensure data sharing policies and processes in low- and middle-income settings are appropriately informed by stakeholders’ perspectives.",10,3,225,238,Empirical research; Public health; Sociology; Social responsibility; Best practice; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Health policy; Data access; Knowledge management,biomedical research ethics; clinical research; data access; data release; data sharing; health policy; low-income countries; middle-income countries; privacy; research data; research governance; systematic review,Attitude; Biomedical Research/ethics; Cooperative Behavior; Developing Countries; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Policy; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Public Health; Social Responsibility,,Wellcome Trust (096527) United Kingdom,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1556264615594767 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1556264615594767 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1556264615594767 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1556264615594767 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/541773 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26297745 http://jre.sagepub.com/content/10/3/225.full.pdf https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/541773 https://www.weh.ox.ac.uk/publications/541773 https://www.ethox.ox.ac.uk/publications/541773 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4548478/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1556264615594767,26297745,10.1177/1556264615594767,2275481531,PMC4548478,0,000-045-772-004-933; 001-535-766-488-191; 003-134-632-708-473; 004-963-083-257-642; 005-676-078-577-195; 005-963-227-450-959; 006-659-091-375-08X; 008-961-934-377-877; 010-527-516-552-564; 015-057-227-739-881; 015-082-920-413-905; 017-300-737-144-757; 017-786-387-317-672; 019-538-368-158-59X; 020-013-516-594-400; 020-285-475-031-714; 023-097-073-292-349; 024-410-972-405-612; 024-888-831-289-040; 025-273-277-004-364; 026-205-597-910-501; 026-955-732-349-060; 028-974-909-584-40X; 030-144-413-225-568; 032-465-306-782-828; 032-520-030-950-067; 033-706-344-295-941; 035-813-132-606-003; 037-126-838-015-529; 038-157-414-709-63X; 038-824-642-263-293; 038-924-998-222-79X; 041-489-944-656-87X; 042-355-275-020-040; 043-330-560-213-592; 043-400-507-013-20X; 043-461-666-754-223; 043-608-798-344-369; 044-230-020-749-669; 044-255-189-768-380; 046-849-371-099-946; 047-630-982-497-003; 048-382-477-690-730; 048-797-583-141-940; 049-339-775-351-182; 051-798-070-801-256; 053-474-155-799-521; 054-212-966-623-833; 055-844-121-676-994; 059-676-174-819-069; 059-970-757-533-318; 060-036-599-079-350; 060-953-788-714-235; 061-609-458-303-306; 063-156-205-440-998; 065-522-822-259-190; 066-037-738-971-799; 067-481-268-141-412; 067-518-598-950-235; 068-667-265-593-511; 076-759-272-022-256; 077-445-251-131-001; 078-630-742-495-759; 079-005-412-286-332; 081-101-116-084-033; 083-275-795-865-394; 089-795-248-092-369; 091-988-878-708-482; 092-578-296-831-573; 095-311-496-746-644; 099-174-041-338-924; 100-441-363-187-695; 104-414-389-627-064; 116-249-751-612-308; 118-085-022-435-430; 119-543-511-508-778; 120-679-397-299-623; 124-707-160-725-322; 127-245-670-262-773; 132-161-958-540-026; 135-302-870-468-483; 135-864-097-354-909; 136-077-427-941-158; 148-606-129-783-215; 168-868-297-922-515,45

Templeton; Zafeiris Zafeiriou; Diletta Bianchini; Roberta Ferraldeschi; Amit Bahl; Liji Shen; Z. Su; Oliver Sartor; J.S. de Bono,"ABSTRACT We investigated the value of the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with CRPC treated with chemotherapy in the phase III TROPIC trial. High NLR was associated with worse survival (OS) and reduced PSA and radiographic response. Conversion (high to low NLR) was associated with improved OS. NLR can be a useful biomarker to assess prognosis and response to treatment. Background The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), proposed as an indicator of cancer-related inflammation, has known prognostic value in prostate cancer. We examine its association with survival (OS) and response in patients treated with second-line chemotherapy. Methods We analysed patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated in the TROPIC trial, evaluating cabazitaxel versus mitoxantrone. Cox regression models were used to investigate the association of baseline NLR (BLNLR) with OS and the significance of a change in NLR count with treatment. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association of BLNLR counts with prostate specific antigen (PSA) and RECIST responses. The optimal NLR cut-off was established based on the concordance index of different values. Results Data from 755, 654 and 405 patients was available for OS, PSA and RECIST response analysis respectively. Median OS was 14.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.2–14.8]. Median NLR was 2.9 (IQR: 1.9–5.1). BLNLR was associated with survival (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.1,P = 0.011) in multivariable analysis (MVA) independently of variables included in the Halabi nomogram, treatment arm and corticosteroid use. The optimal cut-off for a dichotomous NLR was selected at 3.0 based on its higher c-index related to survival. BLNLR ≥3.0 was associated with lower PSA response (40.1% versus 59.9%;P Conclusions NLR is a valid prognostic biomarker in CRPC and is associated with survival, PSA and RECIST responses in patients treated with second-line chemotherapy. Changes in NLR counts with treatment may indicate benefit. NLR prognostic value is independent of prior use of corticosteroids.

Drumright; Mihaela van der Schaar,"The medical and machine learning communities are relying on the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) to transform medicine through enabling more accurate decisions and personalized treatment. However, progress is slow. Legal and ethical issues around unconsented patient data and privacy is one of the limiting factors in data sharing, resulting in a significant barrier in accessing routinely collected electronic health records (EHR) by the machine learning community. We propose a novel framework for generating synthetic data that closely approximates the joint distribution of variables in an original EHR dataset, providing a readily accessible, legally and ethically appropriate solution to support more open data sharing, enabling the development of AI solutions. In order to address issues around lack of clarity in defining sufficient anonymization, we created a quantifiable, mathematical definition for “identifiability”. We used a conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework to generate synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient. We compared models fitted to our synthetically generated data to those fitted to the real data across four independent datasets to evaluate similarity in model performance, while assessing the extent to which original observations can be identified from the synthetic data. Our model, ADS-GAN, consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrated reliability in the joint distributions. We propose that this method could be used to develop datasets that can be made publicly available while considerably lowering the risk of breaching patient confidentiality.",24,8,2378,2388,Machine learning; Identifiability; Artificial intelligence; Synthetic data; Reliability (computer networking); Joint probability distribution; Data anonymization; Data sharing; Open data; Computer science; Artificial neural network,,"Data Anonymization; Electronic Health Records; Female; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Male; Neural Networks, Computer",,Medical Research Council (MR/S013164/1) United Kingdom; Department of Health United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32167919/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32167919 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9034117/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/titb/titb24.html#YoonDS20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2020.2980262,32167919,10.1109/jbhi.2020.2980262,3012140936,,0,009-832-628-132-156; 010-860-813-885-559; 019-977-350-234-640; 034-480-315-502-419; 035-603-945-397-477; 037-755-542-024-188; 042-691-092-890-695; 057-073-681-690-495; 059-147-794-146-13X; 062-557-820-103-652; 064-107-733-555-196; 075-540-151-362-059; 075-926-285-709-515; 079-509-090-064-188; 087-932-019-848-789; 088-204-222-396-854; 089-873-420-850-207; 091-692-551-232-758; 099-445-785-362-259; 099-636-496-379-523; 101-341-308-868-533; 118-699-165-377-422; 138-894-485-947-788; 155-338-218-673-080; 158-804-209-744-953; 160-047-026-196-962; 166-593-301-710-660; 175-828-037-217-761; 176-679-265-573-207; 189-435-012-397-779; 190-181-955-478-329,31

We have developed GenRe-Mekong, a platform for genetic surveillance of malaria in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) that enables NMCPs to implement large-scale surveillance projects by integrating simple sample collection procedures in routine public health procedures.MethodsSamples from symptomatic patients are processed by SpotMalaria, a high-throughput system that produces a comprehensive set of genotypes comprising several drug resistance markers, species markers and a genomic barcode. GenRe-Mekong delivers Genetic Report Cards, a compendium of genotypes and phenotype predictions used to map prevalence of resistance to multiple drugs.ResultsGenRe-Mekong has worked with NMCPs and research projects in eight countries, processing 9623 samples from clinical cases. Monitoring resistance markers has been valuable for tracking the rapid spread of parasites resistant to the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination therapy. In Vietnam and Laos, GenRe-Mekong data have provided novel knowledge about the spread of these resistant strains into previously unaffected provinces, informing decision-making by NMCPs.ConclusionsGenRe-Mekong provides detailed knowledge about drug resistance at a local level, and facilitates data sharing at a regional level, enabling cross-border resistance monitoring and providing the public health community with valuable insights.

Winter; Raoul C. Reulen; Michael M. Hawkins,"Introduction Solid organ transplant patients are counselled regarding increased risk of cancer (principally due to their need for lifelong immunosuppression) and it ranks as one of their biggest self-reported worries. Post-transplantation cancer is common, associated with increased healthcare costs and emerging as a leading cause of post-transplant mortality. However, epidemiology of cancer post-transplantation remains poorly understood, with limitations including translating data from different countries and national data being siloed across different registries and/or data warehouses. Methods and analysis Study methodology for Epidemiology of Cancer after Solid Organ Transplantation involves record linkage between the UK Transplant Registry (from NHS Blood and Transplant), Hospital Episode Statistics (for secondary care episodes from NHS Digital), National Cancer Registry (from cancer registration data hosted by Public Health England) and the National Death Registry (from NHS Digital). Deterministic record linkage will be conducted by NHS Digital, with a fully anonymised linked dataset available for analysis by the research team. The study cohort will consist of up to 85 410 solid organ transplant recipients,who underwent a solid organ transplant in England between 1 January 1985 and 31 December 2015, with up-to-date outcome data. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Confidentiality Advisory Group (reference: 16/CAG/0121), Research Ethics Committee (reference: 15/YH/0320) and Institutional Review Board (reference: RRK5471). The results of this study will be presented at national and international conferences, and manuscripts with results will be submitted for publication in high-impact peer-reviewed journals. The information produced will also be used to develop national evidence-based clinical guidelines to inform risk stratification to enable risk-based clinical follow-up.

While this move towards open science is progressing, there has been a strengthening internationally of data protection regulations that seek to safeguard the rights of data subjects while promoting the movement of data for the benefit of research. In line with this global shift, many jurisdictions in Africa are introducing data protection regulations, but there has been limited consideration of the regulation of data sharing for genomic research and biobanking in Africa. South Africa (SA) is one country that has sought to regulate the international sharing of data and has enacted the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) 2013 that will change the governance and regulation of data in SA, including health research data, once it is in force. To identify and discuss challenges and opportunities in the governance of data sharing for genomic and health research data in SA, a two-day meeting was convened in February 2019 in Cape Town, SA with over 30 participants with expertise in law, ethics, genomics and biobanking science, drawn from academia, industry, and government.

Evans; Peter Sandercock; Carrol Gamble,"The independent oversight of clinical trials, which is recommended by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, is typically provided by an independent advisory Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) and an independent executive committee, to whom the DMC makes recommendations. The detailed roles and function of this executive committee, known as the Trial Steering Committee (TSC), have not previously been studied or reviewed since those originally proposed by the MRC in 1998. An expert panel (n = 7) was convened comprising statisticians, clinicians and trial methodologists with prior TSC experience. Twelve questions about the role and responsibilities of the TSC were discussed by the panel at two full-day meetings. Each meeting was transcribed in full and the discussions were summarised. The expert panel reached agreement on the role of the TSC, to which it was accountable, the membership, the definition of independence, and the experience and training needed. The management of ethical issues, difficult/complex situations and issues the TSC should not ask the DMC to make recommendations on were more difficult to discuss without specific examples, but support existed for further work to help share issues and to provide appropriate training for TSC members. Additional topics discussed, which had not been identified by previous work relating to the DMCs but were pertinent to the role of the TSC, included the following: review of data sharing requests, indemnity, lifespan of the TSC, general TSC administration, and the roles of both the Funder and the Sponsor. This paper presents recommendations that will contribute to the revision and update of the MRC TSC terms of reference. Uncertainty remains in some areas due to the absence of real-life examples; future guidance on these issues would benefit from a repository of case studies. Notably, the role of a patient and public involvement (PPI) contributor was not discussed, and further work is warranted to explore the role of a PPI contributor in independent trial oversight.",16,1,597,597,Psychology; Terms of reference; Conflict of interest; Good clinical practice; Data sharing; Oversight Committee; Committee Membership; Medical education; Clinical trial; Data monitoring committee,,"Advisory Committees/economics; Clinical Trials Data Monitoring Committees/economics; Clinical Trials as Topic/economics; Committee Membership; Conflict of Interest; Consensus; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Professional Role; Research Design/standards; Research Personnel/economics; Research Support as Topic/standards; Surveys and Questionnaires",,Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12023/24) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K025643/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L004933/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L004933/1-R30) United Kingdom,https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/5402 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/exploring-the-role-and-function-of-trial-steering-committees(5430bfd4-a466-4bb0-af25-cae7abc9ad78).html https://www.csm.ox.ac.uk/publications/584452 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/23784717/Exploring_the_role_and_function_of_trial_steering_committees.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13063-015-1125-z https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3000547/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4696246/ http://www.trialsjournal.com/content/16/1/597 https://www.ndorms.ox.ac.uk/publications/584452 https://figshare.com/collections/Exploring_the_role_and_function_of_trial_steering_committees_results_of_an_expert_panel_meeting/3600038 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26715378/ http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26715378 https://www.cardioscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/584452 http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/5402/1/s13063_015_1125_z.pdf https://www.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/publications/584452 https://core.ac.uk/display/77614511 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs13063-015-1125-z.pdf https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-015-1125-z https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/2478734 https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/exploring-the-role-and-function-of-trial-steering-committees-resu https://www.mrc-phru.ox.ac.uk/publications/584452 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/584452 https://core.ac.uk/download/43717471.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13063-015-1125-z,26715378,10.1186/s13063-015-1125-z,2215498500,PMC4696246,0,000-204-561-555-079; 014-370-109-786-50X; 014-957-516-604-163; 017-871-975-882-404; 018-498-010-874-671; 027-125-492-797-705; 027-605-544-878-850; 035-427-820-156-362; 039-490-772-781-055; 041-811-784-973-560; 045-460-046-575-994; 053-054-670-030-281; 057-431-596-943-694; 068-718-193-887-162; 093-084-780-974-601; 097-313-925-354-465; 112-724-570-308-74X; 132-035-603-500-79X; 148-401-365-426-368; 152-667-022-089-139; 193-354-177-178-697,16

Veltman,"A key objective in the field of translational psychiatry over the past few decades has been to identify the brain correlates of major depressive disorder (MDD). Identifying measurable indicators of brain processes associated with MDD could facilitate the detection of individuals at risk, and the development of novel treatments, the monitoring of treatment effects, and predicting who might benefit most from treatments that target specific brain mechanisms. However, despite intensive neuroimaging research towards this effort, underpowered studies and a lack of reproducible findings have hindered progress. Here, we discuss the work of the ENIGMA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Consortium, which was established to address issues of poor replication, unreliable results, and overestimation of effect sizes in previous studies. The ENIGMA MDD Consortium currently includes data from 45 MDD study cohorts from 14 countries across six continents. The primary aim of ENIGMA MDD is to identify structural and functional brain alterations associated with MDD that can be reliably detected and replicated across cohorts worldwide. A secondary goal is to investigate how demographic, genetic, clinical, psychological, and environmental factors affect these associations. In this review, we summarize findings of the ENIGMA MDD disease working group to date and discuss future directions. We also highlight the challenges and benefits of large-scale data sharing for mental health research.",10,1,172,172,Mental health; Depression (differential diagnoses); Disease; MEDLINE; Data sharing;

Here we provide a perspective on the use of WGS for meningococcal molecular surveillance and outbreak investigation, where it helps to characterize pathogens, predict pathogen traits, identify emerging pathogens, and investigate pathogen transmission during outbreaks. Standardization of WGS workflows has facilitated their implementation by clinical and public health laboratories (PHLs), but further development is required for metagenomic shotgun sequencing and targeted sequencing to be widely available for culture-free characterization of bacterial meningitis pathogens. Internet-accessible servers are being established to support bioinformatics analysis, data management, and data sharing among PHLs. However, establishing WGS capacity requires investments in laboratory infrastructure and technical knowledge, which is particularly challenging in resource-limited regions, including the African meningitis belt.

The Clinical Genome Resource has established expert panels to adapt the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology classification framework for specific genes and diseases. The Cardiomyopathy Expert Panel selected MYH7, a key contributor to inherited cardiomyopathies, as a pilot gene to develop a broadly applicable approach. Expert revisions were tested with 60 variants using a structured double review by pairs of clinical and diagnostic laboratory experts. Final consensus rules were established via iterative discussions. Adjustments represented disease-/gene-informed specifications (12) or strength adjustments of existing rules (5). Nine rules were deemed not applicable. Key specifications included quantitative frameworks for minor allele frequency thresholds, the use of segregation data, and a semiquantitative approach to counting multiple independent variant occurrences where fully controlled case-control studies are lacking. Initial inter-expert classification concordance was 93%. Internal data from participating diagnostic laboratories changed the classification of 20% of the variants (n = 12), highlighting the critical importance of data sharing. These adapted rules provide increased specificity for use in MYH7-associated disorders in combination with expert review and clinical judgment and serve as a stepping stone for genes and disorders with similar genetic and clinical characteristics.",20,3,351,359,Minor allele frequency; Concordance; Standardization; Genomics; Data sharing; Genetic testing; Allele frequency; Computer science; Medical genetics; Computational biology,,"Alleles; Cardiac Myosins/genetics; Cardiomyopathies/diagnosis; Clinical Decision-Making; Expert Testimony; Gene Frequency; Genetic Diseases, Inborn/diagnosis; Genetic Testing/methods; Genetic Variation; Humans; Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics; Phenotype; Reproducibility of Results","MYH7 protein, human; Cardiac Myosins; Myosin Heavy Chains",Medical Research Council (MC_U120085815) United Kingdom; NHGRI NIH HHS (U41 HG006834) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U41 HG009649) United States; British Heart Foundation (RG/12/16/29939) United Kingdom; NHGRI NIH HHS (U01 HG007437) United States; Department of Health (NIHR-HCS-D13-04-006) United Kingdom; British Heart Foundation (SP/10/10/28431) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UP_1102/20) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (107469/Z/15/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; NHGRI NIH HHS (U41 HG009650) United States,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37067724 https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/1/37067724/1/5876064.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/153315598 https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/65097568/gim2017218.pdf https://www.cardioscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/815184 https://www.gimjournal.org/article/S1098-3600(21)01884-0/fulltext https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5876064/ https://repository.icr.ac.uk/handle/internal/3104 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F56831a42-d6e8-4756-902a-d0a616b6a14d https://nature.com/articles/gim2017218 https://www.nature.com/articles/gim2017218.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29300372/ https://www.rdm.ox.ac.uk/publications/815184 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29300372 https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/65097568/gim2017218.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/237406594.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/gim.2017.218,29300372,10.1038/gim.2017.218,2782210658,PMC5876064,0,002-021-098-047-523; 004-623-534-720-480; 005-377-674-977-777; 009-995-432-504-25X; 010-635-713-938-093; 012-387-393-625-444; 012-713-554-560-735; 015-307-411-123-672; 020-540-115-441-184; 023-270-551-046-537; 024-051-701-812-919; 028-467-284-590-474; 033-812-785-400-777; 037-920-866-166-04X; 045-150-329-689-699; 047-722-337-913-949; 051-509-530-427-290; 059-275-503-882-548; 090-915-657-285-689; 092-130-054-078-165; 093-107-829-204-536; 096-008-000-717-028; 113-693-596-426-020; 125-849-710-351-207; 127-016-670-476-238,188

In epidemics and pandemics like Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19, the case for such practices seems especially urgent and warranted. Yet rapidly sharing data widely has previously generated significant concerns related to equity. The continued lack of understanding and guidance on equitable data sharing raises the following questions: Should data sharing in epidemics and pandemics primarily advance utility, or should it advance equity as well? If so, what norms comprise equitable data sharing in epidemics and pandemics? Do these norms address the equity-related concerns raised by researchers, data providers, and other stakeholders? What tensions must be balanced between equity and other values? METHODS: To explore these questions, we undertook a systematic scoping review of the literature on data sharing in epidemics and pandemics and thematically analyzed identified literature for its discussion of ethical values, norms, concerns, and tensions, with a particular (but not exclusive) emphasis on equity. We wanted to both understand how equity in data sharing is being conceptualized and draw out other important values and norms for data sharing in epidemics and pandemics. RESULTS: We found that values of utility, equity, solidarity, and reciprocity were described, and we report their associated norms, including researcher recognition; rapid, real-time sharing; capacity development; and fair benefits to data generators, data providers, and source countries. The value of utility and its associated norms were discussed substantially more than others. Tensions between utility norms (e.g., rapid, real-time sharing) and equity norms (e.g., researcher recognition, equitable access) were raised. CONCLUSIONS: This study found support for equity being advanced by data sharing in epidemics and pandemics. However, norms for equitable data sharing in epidemics and pandemics require further development, particularly in relation to power sharing and participatory approaches prioritizing inclusion. Addressing structural inequities in the wider global health landscape is also needed to achieve equitable data sharing in epidemics and pandemics.",22,1,136,136,Public economics; Philosophy of medicine; Political science; Reciprocity (social psychology); Value (ethics); Equity (finance); Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Global health; Pandemic,Covid-19; Data sharing; Epidemic; Equity; Ethics; Pandemic; Utility,COVID-19; Humans; Information Dissemination; Organizations; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection/epidemiology,,University of Melbourne (R Douglas Wright Fellowship); Wellcome Trust (221559/Z/20/Z) United Kingdom,https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-021-00701-8 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34615519/ https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1599733-equitable-data-sharing-in-epidemics-and-pandemics https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493940 https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/ar/covidwho-1455958,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-021-00701-8,34615519,10.1186/s12910-021-00701-8,3202091935,PMC8493940,0,001-901-089-302-421; 005-604-294-584-012; 005-896-668-527-66X; 006-935-806-178-724; 007-064-438-964-208; 007-083-326-821-628; 009-358-531-648-679; 012-796-093-198-628; 015-813-207-711-276; 016-058-940-550-292; 016-267-593-890-591; 016-493-099-898-69X; 016-566-584-485-877; 017-591-439-495-893; 019-538-368-158-59X; 021-338-464-472-912; 022-389-275-992-579; 024-803-376-872-350; 028-232-069-918-098; 028-528-192-865-799; 028-734-248-034-765; 029-270-986-463-32X; 030-833-975-647-205; 031-747-239-767-319; 034-229-445-194-426; 034-453-249-433-57X; 036-312-661-618-588; 037-550-015-414-716; 037-574-958-291-594; 040-763-197-605-464; 042-161-629-787-324; 042-498-997-163-017; 043-656-591-913-815; 044-287-490-479-170; 045-504-804-515-088; 046-613-131-388-297; 047-896-279-996-263; 048-275-746-341-309; 048-812-202-487-618; 048-993-043-222-107; 049-599-904-271-033; 049-687-048-028-953; 052-203-509-102-496; 053-102-512-926-094; 057-326-382-019-24X; 057-377-916-684-931; 057-942-705-552-604; 060-211-428-867-825; 061-068-961-525-687; 063-069-042-478-055; 064-447-833-281-218; 067-235-854-748-766; 069-759-158-186-27X; 078-486-960-086-925; 078-669-122-340-463; 079-006-116-409-275; 083-018-696-137-378; 084-211-184-614-987; 084-464-335-611-683; 086-995-297-227-140; 088-724-151-568-637; 089-327-964-532-639; 089-730-661-523-807; 090-699-356-420-572; 091-182-490-204-656; 097-628-129-516-247; 102-035-178-980-543; 106-756-011-761-512; 111-698-549-482-222; 111-753-324-311-181; 114-992-382-997-705; 118-662-094-624-131; 126-871-425-351-950; 127-218-981-043-419; 127-245-670-262-773; 132-161-958-540-026; 136-927-028-753-772; 142-041-247-772-468; 147-879-752-024-509; 148-606-129-783-215; 149-542-723-070-556; 150-611-071-696-175; 156-355-455-496-621; 173-267-222-245-684,0

Dolan,"Humans bargaining over money tend to reject unfair offers, whilst chimpanzees bargaining over primary rewards of food do not show this same motivation to reject. Whether such reciprocal fairness represents a predominantly human motivation has generated considerable recent interest. We induced either moderate or severe thirst in humans using intravenous saline, and examined responses to unfairness in an Ultimatum Game with water. We ask if humans also reject unfair offers for primary rewards. Despite the induction of even severe thirst, our subjects rejected unfair offers. Further, our data provide tentative evidence that this fairness motivation was traded-off against the value of the primary reward to the individual, a trade-off determined by the subjective value of water rather than by an objective physiological metric of value.

Turner; Azara Janmohamed; Pascal Borry; Munir Pirmohamed,"Pharmacogenomics has a burgeoning role in cardiovascular medicine, from warfarin dosing to antiplatelet choice, with recent developments in sequencing bringing the promise of personalised medicine ever closer to the bedside. Further scientific evidence, real-world clinical trials, and economic modelling are needed to fully realise this potential. Additionally, tools such as polygenic risk scores, and results from Mendelian randomisation analyses, are only in the early stages of clinical translation and merit further investigation. Genetically targeted rational drug design has a strong evidence base and, due to the nature of genetic data, academia, direct-to-consumer companies, healthcare systems, and industry may meet in an unprecedented manner. Data sharing navigation may prove problematic. The present manuscript addresses these issues and concludes a need for further guidance to be provided to prescribers by professional bodies to aid in the consideration of such complexities and guide translation of scientific knowledge to personalised clinical action, thereby striving to improve patient care.

Objectives The aim of this article was to describe the process of identifying attributes for a DCE study aiming to elicit preferences of citizens in Sweden, Iceland and the UK for governance mechanisms for digitally sharing different kinds of health data in different contexts. Methods A three-step approach was utilised to inform the attribute and level selection: 1) Attribute identification, 2) Attribute development and 3) Attribute refinement. First, we developed an initial set of potential attributes from a literature review and a workshop with experts. To further develop attributes, focus group discussions with citizens (n = 13), ranking exercises among focus group participants (n = 48) and expert interviews (n = 18) were performed. Thereafter, attributes were refined using group discussion (n = 3) with experts as well as cognitive interviews with citizens (n = 11). Results The results led to the selection of seven attributes for further development: 1) level of identification, 2) the purpose of data use, 3) type of information, 4) consent, 5) new data user, 6) collector and 7) the oversight of data sharing. Differences were found between countries regarding the order of top three attributes. The process outlined participants’ conceptualisation of the chosen attributes, and what we learned for our attribute development phase. Conclusions This study demonstrates a process for selection of attributes for a (multi-country) DCE involving three stages: Attribute identification, Attribute development and Attribute refinement. This study can contribute to improve the ethical aspects and good practice of this phase in DCE studies. Specifically, it can contribute to the development of governance mechanisms in the digital world, where people's health data are shared for multiple purposes.",66,,101625,,Selection (linguistics); Set (psychology); Ranking; Data sharing; Corporate governance; Computer science; Process (engineering); Knowledge management; Focus group; Identification (information),,,,UK Research and Innovation; Economic and Social Research Council; NordForsk,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160791X21001007 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/teinso/v66y2021ics0160791x21001007.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21001007 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepub.eur.nl%3A136425 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/136425 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/289987,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101625,,10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101625,3173942160,,0,000-541-435-302-414; 000-574-644-855-905; 001-590-222-771-062; 004-325-669-902-622; 006-133-706-270-73X; 008-201-876-719-59X; 008-793-317-638-517; 013-489-122-882-08X; 013-813-279-154-883; 014-140-218-278-05X; 020-154-433-095-162; 026-582-284-480-399; 028-900-415-372-560; 031-394-590-968-707; 032-448-040-217-017; 033-579-942-443-626; 034-548-036-987-474; 035-182-011-743-150; 038-156-044-038-589; 046-130-920-224-256; 048-449-641-786-907; 049-527-189-300-831; 050-471-266-637-186; 051-625-335-777-20X; 052-284-678-349-665; 057-657-809-679-383; 061-515-554-071-19X; 068-793-687-085-514; 070-245-108-339-423; 085-320-250-288-390; 085-919-700-879-544; 094-139-419-018-581; 103-930-969-143-394; 112-197-518-933-706; 114-485-170-241-301; 114-685-371-109-418; 117-230-617-699-971; 118-909-273-885-291; 122-059-015-538-234; 128-663-863-922-879; 187-809-618-014-622,1

Ankeny; Robert Cook-Deegan,"The Bermuda Principles for DNA sequence data sharing are an enduring legacy of the Human Genome Project (HGP). They were adopted by the HGP at a strategy meeting in Bermuda in February of 1996 and implemented in formal policies by early 1998, mandating daily release of HGP-funded DNA sequences into the public domain. The idea of daily sharing, we argue, emanated directly from strategies for large, goal-directed molecular biology projects first tested within the “community” of C. elegans researchers, and were introduced and defended for the HGP by the nematode biologists John Sulston and Robert Waterston. In the C. elegans community, and subsequently in the HGP, daily sharing served the pragmatic goals of quality control and project coordination. Yet in the HGP human genome, we also argue, the Bermuda Principles addressed concerns about gene patents impeding scientific advancement, and were aspirational and flexible in implementation and justification. They endured as an archetype for how rapid data sharing could be realized and rationalized, and permitted adaptation to the needs of various scientific communities. Yet in addition to the support of Sulston and Waterston, their adoption also depended on the clout of administrators at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the UK nonprofit charity the Wellcome Trust, which together funded 90% of the HGP human sequencing effort. The other nations wishing to remain in the HGP consortium had to accommodate to the Bermuda Principles, requiring exceptions from incompatible existing or pending data access policies for publicly funded research in Germany, Japan, and France. We begin this story in 1963, with the biologist Sydney Brenner’s proposal for a nematode research program at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) at the University of Cambridge. We continue through 2003, with the completion of the HGP human reference genome, and conclude with observations about policy and the historiography of molecular biology.",51,4,693,805,Political science;

This is rarely acknowledged, even though the ethical implications are considerable and span both process and product. I argue that big-team qualitative researchers can strengthen claims to rigor in analysis (the product) by drawing on a growing body of knowledge about how to do credible secondary analysis. Since this necessitates a full account of how the research and the analysis are done (the process), I consider the structural disincentives for providing these. Debates around credibility and rigor are not new to qualitative research in international development, but they intensify when new actors such as program evaluators and quantitative researchers use qualitative methods on a large scale. In this context, I look at the utility of guidelines used by these actors to ensure the quality of qualitative research. I ask whether these offer pragmatic suggestions to improve its quality, recognizing the common and hierarchized separation between the generation and interpretation of data, or conversely, whether they set impossible standards and fail to recognize the differences between and respective strengths of qualitative and quantitative research.",63,5,604,621,Sociology; Body of knowledge; Qualitative research; Status quo; Quality (business); Context (language use); Credibility; Engineering ethics; Big data; Qualitative property,,,,Economic and Social Research Council,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/67532/ https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6431269 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764218784636 https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/publications/rigor-and-ethics-in-the-world-of-big-team-qualitative-data-experi https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0002764218784636 https://core.ac.uk/download/196592078.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0002764218784636,,10.1177/0002764218784636,2852717006,,0,000-211-255-897-156; 003-206-910-911-480; 006-811-474-869-910; 007-941-731-117-499; 008-533-619-939-269; 014-930-008-715-81X; 015-058-186-044-411; 016-934-853-290-119; 017-397-452-615-651; 018-196-382-224-406; 019-097-389-383-138; 020-007-215-315-614; 024-268-019-618-387; 046-697-731-685-51X; 049-590-310-056-917; 050-483-731-377-059; 055-950-602-314-029; 056-299-401-891-096; 064-045-613-457-11X; 064-733-293-055-742; 069-607-101-570-913; 073-067-347-540-570; 076-527-919-739-184; 080-130-335-447-101; 086-748-049-147-602; 088-023-270-093-054; 095-815-328-917-28X; 106-543-233-855-486; 110-411-149-370-443; 124-987-643-049-76X; 140-838-702-530-571; 191-510-622-079-283,3

Déirdre Hollingsworth,"Background: Our understanding of pathogens and disease transmission has improved dramatically over the past 100 years, but coinfection, how different pathogens interact with each other, remains a challenge. Cross-sectional serological studies including multiple pathogens offer a crucial insight into this problem.  Methods: We use data from three cross-sectional serological surveys (in 2003, 2007 and 2013) in a Baltimore emergency department to predict the prevalence for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and herpes simplex virus, type 2 (HSV2), in a fourth survey (in 2016). We develop a mathematical model to make this prediction and to estimate the incidence of infection and coinfection in each age and ethnic group in each year. Results: Overall we find a much stronger age cohort effect than a time effect, so that, while incidence at a given age may decrease over time, individuals born at similar times experience a more constant force of infection over time. Conclusions: These results emphasise the importance of age-cohort counselling and early intervention while people are young. Our approach adds value to data such as these by providing age- and time-specific incidence estimates which could not be obtained any other way, and allows forecasting to enable future public health planning.",5,,116,,Epidemiology; Ethnic group; Public health; Demography; Cohort effect; Hepatitis C virus; Coinfection; Emergency department; Incidence (epidemiology); Medicine,,,,"Medical Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; National Institutes of Health; National Institutes of Health",https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/5-116 https://gatesopenresearch.org/articles/5-116/v1/xml,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13261.1,,10.12688/gatesopenres.13261.1,3189639383,,0,000-439-778-297-820; 003-594-895-544-340; 004-007-151-826-174; 006-613-381-656-652; 008-131-062-796-691; 009-427-545-248-509; 009-719-349-754-644; 011-593-862-987-431; 013-411-692-057-014; 015-856-292-868-71X; 018-273-488-062-675; 019-715-201-780-111; 021-037-887-314-941; 023-779-044-718-265; 028-163-409-929-740; 035-246-380-519-883; 040-889-064-687-164; 042-671-153-423-305; 047-638-089-810-884; 052-130-486-356-092; 052-867-692-299-531; 055-413-167-463-041; 055-748-722-750-598; 062-124-445-615-838; 062-411-558-703-721; 064-290-579-824-404; 070-595-683-908-055; 070-673-888-962-195; 074-114-060-704-801; 076-522-130-698-669; 077-186-831-760-708; 081-655-304-464-468; 085-990-793-914-573; 087-200-879-578-439; 088-094-941-803-415; 105-058-065-073-788; 122-202-328-727-06X; 128-800-054-894-458; 140-546-664-319-171; 161-415-110-571-131,0

This study analyses consent documents used by investigators in the H3Africa (Human Heredity and Health in Africa) Consortium.A qualitative method for text analysis was used to analyse consent documents used in the collection of samples and data in H3Africa projects. Thematic domains included type of consent model, explanations of genetics/genomics, data sharing and feedback of test results.Informed consent documents for 13 of the 19 H3Africa projects were analysed. Seven projects used broad consent, five projects used tiered consent and one used specific consent. Genetics was mostly explained in terms of inherited characteristics, heredity and health, genes and disease causation, or disease susceptibility. Only one project made provisions for the feedback of individual genetic results.H3Africa research makes use of three consent models-specific, tiered and broad consent. We outlined different strategies used by H3Africa investigators to explain concepts in genomics to potential research participants. To further ensure that the decision to participate in genomic research is informed and meaningful, we recommend that innovative approaches to the informed consent process be developed, preferably in consultation with research participants, research ethics committees and researchers in Africa.",42,2,132,137,Biobank; Research ethics; Alternative medicine; Test (assessment); Information Dissemination; Community-based participatory research; Data sharing; Medical education; Informed consent; Medicine,Informed Consent,Africa; Biological Specimen Banks/ethics; Blacks/genetics; Community-Based Participatory Research/ethics; Consent Forms/ethics; Genetic Research/ethics; Humans; Information Dissemination/ethics; Informed Consent/ethics,,Wellcome Trust (099313) United Kingdom; NIMH NIH HHS (U01 MH096754) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (5U01MH096754) United States,https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1481229 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4650106/ https://jme.bmj.com/content/medethics/42/2/132.full.pdf https://jme.bmj.com/content/42/2/132.full.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/MUNOIC https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1481229.pdf https://jme.bmj.com/content/42/2/132.short?42/2/132 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4752624/ https://jme.bmj.com/content/42/2/132 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4752624 https://core.ac.uk/download/161818215.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2015-102796,26644426,10.1136/medethics-2015-102796,2193530270,PMC4752624,0,001-849-509-394-479; 002-834-754-415-098; 004-579-039-732-024; 004-613-862-207-388; 005-012-445-454-882; 005-873-644-038-667; 006-897-765-523-020; 007-420-275-874-571; 009-373-310-180-940; 010-494-004-999-583; 012-359-552-892-526; 014-691-237-394-700; 015-053-505-151-458; 018-681-209-481-264; 026-354-553-648-432; 029-517-503-460-530; 033-706-344-295-941; 038-157-414-709-63X; 043-238-582-252-339; 043-813-119-071-745; 045-393-570-934-511; 052-322-297-207-668; 053-508-089-730-675; 053-697-403-010-226; 058-448-259-703-646; 060-183-433-104-114; 067-614-735-291-118; 071-155-468-949-37X; 072-262-714-849-607; 081-398-140-756-450; 084-925-685-032-541; 093-303-946-580-475; 098-467-958-343-461; 105-454-466-584-698; 109-323-595-257-621; 111-176-174-868-090; 117-694-051-393-388; 158-412-144-544-236; 159-634-985-216-931; 188-270-297-190-317,38

The data enable us to optimise resources, personalise services and offer unprecedented insights into our lives. However, to achieve these insights data need to be shared (and sometimes sold) between organisations imposing rights and obligations upon the sharing parties and in accordance with multiple layers of sometimes conflicting legislation at international, national and organisational levels. In this work, we show how such rules can be captured in a formal representation called ""Data Sharing Agreements"". We introduce the use of abductive reasoning and argumentation based techniques to work with context dependent rules, detect inconsistencies between them, and resolve the inconsistencies by assigning priorities to the rules. We show how through the use of argumentation based techniques use-cases taken from real life application are handled flexibly addressing trade-offs between confidentiality, privacy, availability and safety.",,,231,238,Abductive reasoning; Data sharing; Context (language use); Computer science; Data access; Access control; Knowledge management; Argumentation theory; Confidentiality; Cloud computing,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Seventh Framework Programme,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sacmat/sacmat2017.html#KarafiliL17 https://doi.org/10.1145/3078861.3078876 https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3078861.3078876,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3078861.3078876,,10.1145/3078861.3078876,2617140658,,0,002-748-734-149-369; 006-993-145-156-872; 007-472-120-727-053; 010-450-806-447-065; 010-785-109-616-673; 011-091-270-902-780; 015-731-004-642-531; 017-860-030-105-899; 027-260-712-684-887; 031-921-784-901-473; 033-608-348-986-791; 036-650-236-262-842; 037-570-685-232-119; 039-832-108-825-221; 046-462-633-335-106; 050-342-052-047-075; 068-643-018-122-118; 074-396-987-027-218; 076-638-640-863-649; 077-537-617-965-229; 093-389-201-749-352; 094-782-787-710-62X; 095-145-088-270-148; 095-778-691-756-812; 106-015-957-457-150; 110-646-304-216-160; 113-093-434-703-428; 119-818-499-394-068; 125-152-797-803-447; 131-640-523-142-91X; 132-300-525-780-451; 136-380-520-163-938; 139-959-510-243-012; 151-725-523-566-42X; 155-447-172-862-902; 179-789-264-971-090,23
5151,097-295-720-655-882,Towards an appropriate ethics framework for Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS): learning from issues faced in diverse HDSS in sub-Saharan Africa.,2021-01-06,2021,journal article,BMJ global health,20597908,BMJ,England,Alex Nginyo Hinga; Sassy Molyneux; Vicki Marsh,"Introduction Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems (HDSS) collect data on births, deaths and migration from relatively small, geographically defined populations primarily in Africa and Asia. HDSS occupy a grey area between research, healthcare and public health practice and it is unclear how ethics guidance that rely on a research-practice distinction apply to HDSS. This topic has received little attention in the literature. In this paper, based on empirical research across sub-Saharan Africa, we map out key ethical issues for HDSS and assess the relevance of current ethics guidance in relation to these findings. Methods We conducted a qualitative study across seven HDSS sites in sub-Saharan Africa, including individual in-depth interviews and informal discussions with 68 research staff, document reviews and non-participant observations of surveillance activities. Qualitative data analysis drew on a framework approach led by a priori and emergent themes, drawing on the wider ethics and social science literature. Results There were diverse views on core ethical issues in HDSS, including regarding the strengths and challenges of community engagement, informed consent and data sharing processes. A key emerging issue was unfairness in the overall balance of benefits and burdens for residents and front-line staff when compared with other stakeholders, particularly given the socioeconomic contexts in which HDSS are generally conducted. Conclusion We argue that HDSS operate as non-traditional epidemiologic research projects but are often governed using ethics guidance developed for traditional forms of health research. There is a need for specific ethics guidance for HDSS which prioritises considerations around fairness, cost-effectiveness, ancillary care responsibilities, longitudinality and obligations of the global community to HDSS residents.",6,1,e004008,,Empirical research; Public health; Sociology; Socioeconomic status; Health care; Qualitative research; Community engagement; Data sharing; Public relations; Informed consent,epidemiology; health systems; public health; qualitative study,Africa South of the Sahara/epidemiology; Demography; Humans; Information Dissemination; Informed Consent; Qualitative Research,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; EPA (EP-C-15-003) United States; Wellcome Trust (203077_Z_16_Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (107769/Z/10/Z) United Kingdom,https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/6/1/e004008.full.pdf https://www.medawar.ox.ac.uk/publications/1157447 https://gh.bmj.com/content/6/1/e004008 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33408190 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1157447,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004008,33408190,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-004008,3118357866,PMC7789450,0,001-796-921-028-626; 001-942-907-086-662; 002-075-574-039-764; 002-263-014-349-607; 004-253-780-435-559; 005-307-382-508-529; 005-308-110-095-761; 006-200-297-698-360; 006-783-751-063-638; 006-815-456-235-47X; 007-091-102-459-009; 008-125-113-736-664; 010-107-875-567-687; 012-912-033-853-69X; 013-079-497-239-611; 014-317-248-529-367; 014-425-384-623-161; 015-276-521-572-568; 015-794-462-966-750; 018-039-388-549-288; 019-311-044-611-080; 020-327-766-614-381; 021-159-427-163-447; 021-527-296-364-914; 024-511-437-536-605; 024-612-035-047-967; 024-813-497-464-272; 025-951-259-302-149; 026-221-709-972-177; 026-254-844-287-392; 027-384-479-697-271; 028-399-624-661-450; 028-403-796-531-723; 030-026-425-083-627; 033-501-577-054-277; 033-505-471-748-64X; 034-338-478-453-466; 034-870-373-652-953; 035-163-785-945-959; 037-064-482-559-849; 038-993-671-032-176; 039-095-843-685-07X; 039-455-911-673-238; 039-672-100-147-702; 041-351-846-842-204; 041-971-520-158-864; 044-115-330-742-151; 047-168-023-046-568; 047-308-501-705-081; 047-724-570-464-544; 048-172-180-225-12X; 049-513-235-281-92X; 052-216-996-426-780; 053-223-415-199-180; 053-767-873-924-154; 056-102-900-367-318; 056-605-617-948-533; 059-398-920-885-31X; 059-690-963-434-437; 060-840-197-607-218; 060-959-113-933-71X; 062-565-809-409-677; 068-328-950-250-449; 068-796-571-615-839; 069-315-857-281-471; 069-869-965-676-272; 071-264-075-780-852; 073-267-268-269-90X; 078-284-561-205-40X; 078-537-692-404-33X; 081-360-616-679-646; 082-109-399-140-148; 083-219-364-674-602; 083-382-639-462-060; 086-470-411-539-657; 087-984-934-479-395; 088-248-944-228-144; 091-182-490-204-656; 093-078-310-378-134; 095-038-707-627-262; 106-629-624-848-045; 110-309-071-908-483; 110-845-677-522-39X; 116-060-107-328-008; 116-205-188-953-087; 119-983-028-281-71X; 137-703-762-312-174; 145-076-928-932-681; 155-896-500-372-632; 156-036-332-656-48X; 160-565-887-434-037; 161-882-711-492-247,3

Here we describe a new release of curated genome variation data on 7,000 Plasmodium falciparum samples from MalariaGEN partner studies in 28 malaria-endemic countries. High-quality genotype calls on 3 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short indels were produced using a standardised analysis pipeline. Copy number variants associated with drug resistance and structural variants that cause failure of rapid diagnostic tests were also analysed.  Almost all samples showed genetic evidence of resistance to at least one antimalarial drug, and some samples from Southeast Asia carried markers of resistance to six commonly-used drugs. Genes expressed during the mosquito stage of the parasite life-cycle are prominent among loci that show strong geographic differentiation. By continuing to enlarge this open data resource we aim to facilitate research into the evolutionary processes affecting malaria control and to accelerate development of the surveillance toolkit required for malaria elimination.",6,42,42,42,Drug resistance; Indel; Copy-number variation; Genotype; Single-nucleotide polymorphism; Genomics; Malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; Genetics; Biology,data resource; drug resistance; evolution; genomic epidemiology; genomics; malaria; plasmodium falciparum; population genetics; rapid diagnostic test failure,,,NIAID NIH HHS (R01 AI101713) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR001863) United States; Medical Research Council (MR/M006212/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (204911/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; World Health Organization (001) International,https://archive.lstmed.ac.uk/id/eprint/18498 https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/publications/1163888 https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/publications/1072504 https://www.medawar.ox.ac.uk/publications/1163888 http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33824913/ https://www.tropmedres.ac/publications/1163888 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-42/v1/pdf https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4659814 https://www.jenner.ac.uk/publications/1163888 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33824913/ https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1508369-an-open-dataset-of-plasmodium-falciparum-genome-variation-in-7-000-worldwide-samples. https://researchinformation.amsterdamumc.org/en/publications/an-open-dataset-of-plasmodium-falciparum-genome-variation-in-7000 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-42/v2/xml https://hal.umontpellier.fr/hal-03228653 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/6-42 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/1163888 https://pennstate.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/an-open-dataset-of-plasmodium-falciparum-genome-variation-in-7000 https://pennstate-staging.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/an-open-dataset-of-plasmodium-falciparum-genome-variation-in-7000 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8008441.2 https://repositorio.upch.edu.pe/handle/20.500.12866/9351?show=full https://researchers.cdu.edu.au/en/publications/an-open-dataset-of-plasmodium-falciparum-genome-variation-in-7000 http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30149568 https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR288032 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F238195,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16168.1,33824913,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16168.1; 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16168.2,2986984498,PMC8008441,0,001-164-769-493-981; 001-590-455-076-204; 001-810-692-277-482; 002-021-298-758-143; 002-199-818-576-502; 002-639-945-789-611; 002-764-826-580-105; 003-043-847-067-550; 003-218-821-677-723; 005-296-247-349-632; 007-981-725-767-408; 008-345-895-678-669; 010-339-675-476-396; 011-412-172-637-471; 013-518-746-144-229; 014-072-207-039-254; 014-294-764-726-659; 015-190-951-708-093; 016-159-010-515-549; 016-338-215-444-389; 016-503-670-432-220; 017-364-324-605-677; 017-743-243-305-349; 018-457-268-934-597; 019-390-582-750-449; 020-116-939-691-933; 022-057-769-681-438; 022-425-076-531-02X; 022-477-138-077-235; 023-233-140-132-411; 023-333-909-243-873; 023-395-190-256-027; 023-892-177-692-761; 025-417-871-725-199; 025-551-607-614-104; 026-109-392-238-619; 027-640-123-734-65X; 027-753-496-843-083; 027-782-286-549-401; 027-888-782-828-974; 028-305-929-831-019; 031-965-418-536-044; 033-693-760-848-939; 034-008-240-442-845; 035-378-058-452-70X; 035-386-627-619-013; 035-993-257-448-839; 036-005-680-152-461; 037-078-822-541-547; 037-857-156-144-912; 038-236-460-029-331; 038-367-475-292-618; 038-953-006-285-257; 040-841-903-756-210; 042-557-576-708-119; 043-461-666-754-223; 044-458-915-268-576; 048-282-068-005-511; 050-220-736-114-982; 052-742-765-003-094; 053-657-698-742-136; 056-111-052-082-460; 056-484-705-117-491; 056-637-525-624-829; 056-840-852-970-351; 060-570-108-916-020; 061-476-981-924-098; 062-251-085-573-962; 065-224-496-118-855; 067-195-833-435-126; 067-963-703-793-151; 068-252-001-054-085; 068-377-811-484-887; 069-029-068-683-235; 075-271-459-933-521; 084-080-479-008-506; 084-752-469-546-043; 089-502-675-320-504; 093-379-857-817-785; 094-482-928-750-680; 097-628-974-903-017; 101-770-994-355-134; 108-484-538-073-819; 109-385-205-494-052; 112-215-916-815-381; 114-131-361-618-492; 120-745-051-730-896; 122-330-659-305-634; 128-066-746-575-761; 129-630-561-173-230; 135-283-986-139-840; 136-649-711-440-386; 140-878-802-832-426; 140-960-449-672-419,34

Martin; John Patrick Aggleton; Shane M. O'Mara,"There is a dearth of freely-available, standardised open source analysis tools available for the analysis of neuronal signals recorded in vivo in the freely-behaving animal. In response, we have developed a freely-available, open-source toolbox, NeuroChaT (Neuron Characterisation Toolbox), specifically addressing this lacuna. Although we have particularly emphasised single unit analyses for spatial coding, NeuroChaT also characterises rhythmic properties of units and their dynamics associated with local field potential signals. NeuroChaT was developed using Python and facilitates a complete pipeline from automation of analysis to producing and managing publication-quality figures. Additionally, we have adopted a platform-independent format (Hierarchical Data Format version 5) for storing recorded and analysed data. By providing an easy-to-use software package, we aim to simplify the adoption of standardised analyses for behavioural neurophysiology and facilitate open data sharing and collaboration between laboratories.",4,,196,,Human–computer interaction; Automation; Encoding (memory); Cognitive map; Hierarchical Data Format; Toolbox; Open data; Computer science; Pipeline (software); Python (programming language),Cognitive map; data analysis; electrophysiology; open software; single unit; spatial coding,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://orca.cf.ac.uk/127644/ https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-196/v1/xml http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32055710 https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/127644/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7001759 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-196 https://doaj.org/article/d233a6041bf444108804501fd5266b4b https://core.ac.uk/download/275553990.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15533.1,32055710,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15533.1,2992442871,PMC7001759,0,000-887-662-656-173; 004-876-303-451-530; 005-454-877-624-484; 006-961-160-648-457; 009-729-471-084-946; 012-993-874-058-671; 013-486-712-559-895; 013-528-633-749-917; 014-024-068-398-452; 014-380-937-799-268; 020-174-102-422-26X; 022-570-609-352-202; 025-173-887-260-949; 027-148-334-913-178; 027-590-070-216-054; 033-442-984-511-466; 037-626-264-313-922; 039-696-987-654-233; 039-926-505-702-468; 042-749-416-305-157; 043-855-833-818-143; 045-876-980-379-326; 051-846-593-594-018; 055-749-303-547-020; 058-478-645-313-336; 058-635-630-508-022; 060-789-135-735-731; 064-206-775-789-015; 066-308-813-125-544; 070-507-012-112-66X; 079-406-091-493-88X; 087-433-750-538-003; 089-107-938-824-246; 090-567-423-464-395; 090-757-508-887-650; 093-568-513-482-187; 101-911-983-150-201; 109-338-798-159-062; 112-644-439-306-749; 121-338-399-003-84X; 122-372-255-566-745,6

One area where big, open data is particularly valuable is in research relating to complex heterogeneous disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The inconsistencies of findings and the great heterogeneity of ASD necessitate the use of big and open data to tackle important challenges such as understanding and defining the heterogeneity and potential subtypes of ASD. To this end, a number of initiatives have been established that aim to develop big and/or open data resources for autism research. In order to provide a useful data reference for autism researchers, a systematic search for ASD data resources was conducted using the Scopus database, the Google search engine, and the pages on 'recommended repositories' by key journals, and the findings were translated into a comprehensive list focused on ASD data. The aim of this review is to systematically search for all available ASD data resources providing the following data types: phenotypic, neuroimaging, human brain connectivity matrices, human brain statistical maps, biospecimens, and ASD participant recruitment. A total of 33 resources were found containing different types of data from varying numbers of participants. Description of the data available from each data resource, and links to each resource is provided. Moreover, key implications are addressed and underrepresented areas of data are identified.",5,,e2880,,Biobank; World Wide Web; Autism; Data science; Open science; Autism spectrum disorder; Data sharing; Open data; Computer science; Resource (project management); Big data,ASD; Autism spectrum disorder; Biobanks; Data sharing; Databases; Heterogeneous disorders; Neuroimaging data; Open science; Phenotypic data; Subtyping,,,Medical Research Council (MC_PC_15018) United Kingdom,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5237363 https://peerj.com/articles/2880/ http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5237363 https://peerj.com/articles/2880/table-1 https://core.ac.uk/display/80839633 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5237363 https://doaj.org/article/69bb84094d154ab28bc050640be4a97f https://peerj.com/articles/2880.pdf https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/113046/ https://core.ac.uk/download/80839633.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2880,28097074,10.7717/peerj.2880,2576210873,PMC5237363,0,001-933-634-408-35X; 001-964-955-434-315; 002-021-147-360-760; 002-215-090-096-019; 003-361-281-809-829; 005-770-012-428-753; 006-466-608-733-134; 007-939-775-319-655; 012-819-539-826-916; 013-099-910-918-465; 013-571-105-914-580; 014-894-252-584-06X; 015-168-044-596-752; 017-044-302-125-223; 019-711-953-160-945; 019-880-681-710-073; 020-495-567-807-044; 020-545-229-948-795; 023-156-148-763-932; 023-249-579-978-030; 023-604-823-472-159; 025-026-566-233-050; 026-534-480-398-863; 026-994-975-060-431; 032-633-073-080-824; 033-207-837-929-475; 040-656-367-101-805; 041-631-404-512-829; 041-955-724-811-642; 042-949-383-646-786; 044-169-295-104-165; 045-672-367-341-720; 046-742-288-716-35X; 051-925-726-619-633; 052-154-004-319-982; 053-203-157-519-568; 057-668-840-652-887; 058-700-141-984-165; 061-522-268-552-916; 066-822-529-368-225; 068-252-359-061-757; 068-937-282-502-164; 070-757-274-387-163; 072-974-973-828-021; 086-208-568-785-967; 091-752-394-103-443; 099-634-984-058-674; 101-968-419-063-059; 125-895-441-680-076; 129-352-103-639-016; 133-216-194-420-092; 165-203-167-748-162,14

Knowles,"Accurate and consistent variant classification is imperative for incorporation of rapidly developing sequencing technologies into genomic medicine for improved patient care. An essential requirement for achieving standardized and reliable variant interpretation is data sharing, facilitated by a centralized open-source database. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an exemplar of the utility of such a resource: it has a high incidence, a favorable prognosis with early intervention and treatment, and cascade screening can be offered to families if a causative variant is identified. ClinVar, an NCBI-funded resource, has become the primary repository for clinically relevant variants in Mendelian disease, including FH. Here, we present the concerted efforts made by the Clinical Genome Resource, through the FH Variant Curation Expert Panel and global FH community, to increase submission of FH-associated variants into ClinVar. Variant-level data was categorized by submitter, variant characteristics, classification method, and available supporting data. To further reform interpretation of FH-associated variants, areas for improvement in variant submissions were identified; these include a need for more detailed submissions and submission of supporting variant-level data, both retrospectively and prospectively. Collaborating to provide thorough, reliable evidence-based variant interpretation will ultimately improve the care of FH patients.",39,11,1631,1640,Genomics; Familial hypercholesterolemia; MEDLINE; Data sharing; Mendelian disease; Dna variants; Genomic medicine; Human genetics; Database; Biology,ClinVar; Clinical Genome Resource; familial hypercholesterolemia; variant interpretation,"DNA/genetics; Databases, Genetic; Genetic Variation/genetics; Genome, Human/genetics; Genomics; Humans; Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II/genetics",DNA,British Heart Foundation (PG08/008) United Kingdom; NHGRI NIH HHS (U41 HG006834) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U41 HG009649) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U01 HG007436) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U41 HG009650) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (U01 HG007437) United States; NIDDK NIH HHS (P30 DK116074) United States,http://observatorio.fm.usp.br/handle/OPI/29399 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30311388/ https://repositorio.insa.pt/handle/10400.18/5620 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30311388 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.amc.nl%3Apublications%2F15bcc06c-8fec-4210-a810-2b3d938fe062 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/111076 https://observatorio.fm.usp.br/handle/OPI/29399 https://www.muni.cz/vyzkum/publikace/1484517 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.23634 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6206854 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6206854,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/humu.23634,30311388,10.1002/humu.23634,2897800944,PMC6206854,0,003-748-190-034-980; 004-063-907-800-852; 009-804-903-121-315; 010-392-318-799-720; 013-512-535-310-461; 015-307-411-123-672; 015-441-569-873-040; 017-049-680-462-30X; 018-322-645-602-654; 026-004-175-833-576; 030-030-913-770-276; 035-065-430-382-094; 037-198-091-447-878; 054-064-969-525-663; 059-344-653-376-92X; 075-731-599-572-400; 084-384-063-123-722; 113-693-596-426-020; 172-098-869-180-016,57

This change in scientific practice has been implemented through new policy developed by many principal investigators, project managers and funders, which has ultimately led to new forms of practice and innovative governance models for data sharing. Here, we examine the development of the governance of data sharing in genomics, and explore some of the key challenges associated with the design and implementation of these policies. We examine how the incremental nature of policy design, the perennial problem of consent, the gridlock caused by multiple and overlapping access systems, the administrative burden and the problems with incentives and acknowledgment all have an impact on the potential for data sharing to be maximized. We conclude by proposing ways in which the scientific community can address these problems, to improve the sustainability of data sharing into the future.",6,1,4,4,Principal (computer security); Key (cryptography); Data science; Gridlock; Data sharing; Incentive; Field (computer science); Corporate governance; Computer science; Knowledge management; Sustainability,,,,Wellcome Trust (096599) United Kingdom,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/gm523 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/447919 https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/21104 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/257035 https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/207847.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24475754/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24475754 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fgm523.pdf https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/gm523 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/3978924/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3978924 https://core.ac.uk/display/81828471,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gm523,24475754,10.1186/gm523,2131526736,PMC3978924,0,000-785-692-812-344; 003-236-149-495-68X; 007-717-082-579-207; 010-768-856-238-675; 011-076-534-151-883; 012-165-717-511-811; 015-161-539-230-638; 016-101-956-894-357; 016-513-542-264-372; 017-332-092-657-286; 018-681-209-481-264; 019-538-368-158-59X; 020-013-516-594-400; 022-056-564-730-094; 022-354-044-631-944; 023-028-822-539-62X; 023-039-762-551-646; 033-397-718-883-873; 034-432-752-164-95X; 036-578-473-701-585; 038-157-414-709-63X; 043-461-666-754-223; 043-658-270-744-992; 050-969-179-014-018; 051-779-433-639-443; 053-955-085-887-768; 057-330-611-744-78X; 060-713-609-759-751; 062-028-764-667-723; 063-156-205-440-998; 063-531-958-018-961; 064-698-966-463-599; 065-563-344-106-464; 065-910-984-473-004; 069-029-068-683-235; 093-162-560-619-06X; 094-381-625-194-127; 106-939-259-059-104; 129-728-432-377-099; 130-804-741-582-878; 143-685-426-334-084; 145-169-825-419-861; 188-270-297-190-317,42

A new identity polarization has arisen between Remain and Leave sympathizers in the UK Brexit debate, with associated accusations of misinformation use. Competing psychological accounts of how people come to accept and defend misinformation pit self-reinforcing motivated cognition against lack of systematic reasoning as possible explanations. We harness insights from political science, cognitive neuroscience and psychology to examine the impact of trust and identity on information processing regarding Brexit in a group of Remain identifiers. Behaviourally, participants' affective responses to Brexit-related information are affected by whether the emotional valence of the message is compatible with their beliefs on Brexit (positive/negative) but not by their trust in the source of information. However, belief in the information is significantly affected by both (dis)trust in information source and by belief compatibility with the valence of the information. Neuroimaging results confirm this pattern, identifying areas involved in judgements of the self, others and automatic processing of affectively threatening stimuli, ultimately supporting motivated cognition accounts of misinformation endorsement.

A variety of such designs have been proposed in the literature, many of which have been adopted in practice. Implementing such trial designs in practice can be challenging, and identifying those challenges was the main objective of a workshop organised by the MRC Hubs for Trials Methodology Research Network's Stratified Medicine Working Group in March 2017. Participants reflected on completed and ongoing biomarker-guided trials to identify the practical challenges encountered. Here, the key challenges identified during the workshop including those related to funding, ethical and regulatory issues, recruitment, monitoring of samples and laboratories, biomarker assessment, and data sharing and resources, are discussed. Despite the complexities often associated with biomarker-guided trials, the workshop concluded that they can play an important role in advancing the field of personalised medicine.

We interviewed researchers, managers, and research participants associated with a Mumbai non-governmental organization, as well as researchers from other organizations and members of ethics committees. We conducted 22 individual semi-structured interviews and involved 44 research participants in focus group discussions. We used framework analysis to examine ideas about data and data sharing in general; its potential benefits or harms, barriers, obligations, and governance; and the requirements for consent. Both researchers and participants were generally in favor of data sharing, although limited experience amplified their reservations. We identified three themes: concerns that the work of data producers may not receive appropriate acknowledgment, skepticism about the process of sharing, and the fact that the terrain of data sharing was essentially uncharted and confusing.

This study investigated the number and types of vaccination-related information sources, and estimated their associations with vaccine confidence and hesitancy in China. In January 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in China, and 2122 caregivers with children <6 years completed self-administered questionnaires. Logistic regressions were used to assess associations between caregivers' primary information sources and vaccine confidence/hesitancy. A majority (72%) of caregivers had multiple sources of vaccination-related information. The proportions of caregivers reporting professional sources, media, and peers as primary information sources were 81%, 63%, and 26%. Internal migrants were less likely to get information from professional sources; more educated and wealthier caregivers reported more information sources and were more likely to get information from media and peers. Caregivers who reported professional information sources had significantly higher odds of being confident about the safety of vaccines and lower odds of being hesitant toward vaccination than those who did not. Caregivers who reported the media as a primary information source had significantly higher odds of being hesitant toward vaccination than those who did not. To address vaccine hesitancy, it is essential to promote universal access to professional vaccination-related information sources, and to use the media to disseminate evidence-based information and clarify misinformation.

Such information may constitute the basis for correlation analyses between genotypes and phenotypes and, in the future, for personalized medicine. Several databases on gene variation exist, but this kind of information is still scarce in the Semantic Web framework. In this paper, we discuss issues related to the integration of mutation data in the Linked Open Data infrastructure, part of the Semantic Web framework. We present the development of a mapping from the IARC TP53 Mutation database to RDF and the implementation of servers publishing this data.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A version of the IARC TP53 Mutation database implemented in a relational database was used as first test set. Automatic mappings to RDF were first created by using D2RQ and later manually refined by introducing concepts and properties from domain vocabularies and ontologies, as well as links to Linked Open Data implementations of various systems of biomedical interest. Since D2RQ query performances are lower than those that can be achieved by using an RDF archive, generated data was also loaded into a dedicated system based on tools from the Jena software suite.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We have implemented a D2RQ Server for TP53 mutation data, providing data on a subset of the IARC database, including gene variations, somatic mutations, and bibliographic references. The server allows to browse the RDF graph by using links both between classes and to external systems. An alternative interface offers improved performances for SPARQL queries. The resulting data can be explored by using any Semantic Web browser or application.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This has been the first case of a mutation database exposed as Linked Data. A revised version of our prototype, including further concepts and IARC TP53 Mutation database data sets, is under development.The publication of variation information as Linked Data opens new perspectives: the exploitation of SPARQL searches on mutation data and other biological databases may support data retrieval which is presently not possible.

These challenges have potential negative impacts, especially in search domains such as health search. Existing information retrieval (IR) systems offer users little (if any) guidance as to how to reduce the likelihood of such negative impacts. The sum of these problems provides motivation for experiments to identify elements of existing IR environments that might provide low-cost options to the user for improved search outcomes. An online user study (N = 90) was performed allowing users to visit search results for 10 medical search tasks adapted from previous research. Analysis was performed on all search results visited in the experiment, with a total of 523 unique web pages collectively visited, with additional analysis performed on a set of 10,000 popular websites. The analysis suggests that the best strategy for users with the goal of protecting their privacy and simultaneously finding more accurate information for their medical search tasks, is to visit websites with .org and .gov in the URL. There is some evidence that HTTP is a useful predictor as well.

Weitzner; Nigel Shadbolt,"Most users of smartphone apps remain unaware of what data about them is being collected, by whom, and how these data are being used. In this mixed methods investigation, we examine the question of whether revealing key data collection practices of smartphone apps may help people make more informed privacy-related decisions. To investigate this question, we designed and prototyped a new class of privacy indicators, called Data Controller Indicators (DCIs), that expose previously hidden information flows out of the apps. Our lab study of DCIs suggests that such indicators do support people in making more confident and consistent choices, informed by a more diverse range of factors, including the number and nature of third-party companies that access users' data. Furthermore, personalised DCIs, which are contextualised against the other apps an individual already uses, enable them to reason effectively about the differential impacts on their overall information exposure.",,,5208,5220,Internet privacy; Data collection; Key (cryptography); Data sharing; Mobile apps; Smartphone app; Computer science; User interface,,,,National Science Foundation; EPSRC,https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6f9b0185-b4c1-4c4c-9ece-d4e2a2d2ef23/download_file?safe_filename=chi2017--accepted-manuscript-version.pdf&file_format=application%2Fpdf&type_of_work=Conference+item https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chi/chi2017.html#KleekLBZWS17 https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6f9b0185-b4c1-4c4c-9ece-d4e2a2d2ef23 https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/publications/publication12831-abstract.html https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025556,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025556,,10.1145/3025453.3025556,2611364582,,0,003-102-064-185-005; 006-814-909-923-28X; 007-356-389-547-794; 010-095-995-113-633; 010-420-569-885-178; 013-883-481-208-439; 015-521-012-167-974; 016-685-869-895-636; 017-607-582-964-799; 019-739-760-807-68X; 022-353-644-624-76X; 025-038-406-959-715; 025-694-203-611-343; 029-787-952-640-027; 030-398-213-179-632; 031-579-531-047-351; 035-758-460-645-491; 037-763-527-510-217; 039-000-540-444-880; 039-351-240-614-934; 041-318-781-759-949; 050-058-610-923-589; 052-352-618-627-346; 058-697-245-836-082; 062-404-589-984-647; 065-199-815-500-399; 065-315-962-233-88X; 070-637-019-428-62X; 072-766-471-955-243; 074-064-947-370-379; 074-835-503-619-009; 078-571-593-230-978; 087-703-982-928-841; 089-243-001-810-984; 090-067-136-198-61X; 094-006-614-317-588; 095-692-264-913-994; 098-159-975-506-299; 102-187-369-778-957; 103-531-642-190-748; 107-632-727-478-124; 115-349-632-829-119; 118-681-622-796-927; 119-993-018-228-340; 120-272-569-124-084; 129-751-805-232-075; 133-521-039-480-213; 138-032-440-662-878; 141-234-927-232-312; 145-546-875-803-440; 150-012-179-453-111; 151-589-997-997-930; 153-482-333-463-226; 153-552-819-955-395; 161-371-721-118-465; 186-380-524-329-29X,69

Wenk,"Human blood is a self-regenerating lipid-rich biological fluid that is routinely collected in hospital settings. The inventory of lipid molecules found in blood plasma (plasma lipidome) offers insights into individual metabolism and physiology in health and disease. Disturbances in the plasma lipidome also occur in conditions that are not directly linked to lipid metabolism; therefore, plasma lipidomics based on MS is an emerging tool in an array of clinical diagnostics and disease management. However, challenges exist in the translation of such lipidomic data to clinical applications. These relate to the reproducibility, accuracy, and precision of lipid quantitation, study design, sample handling, and data sharing. This position paper emerged from a workshop that initiated a community-led process to elaborate and define a set of generally accepted guidelines for quantitative MS-based lipidomics of blood plasma or serum, with harmonization of data acquired on different instrumentation platforms across independent laboratories as an ultimate goal.

Du Chemin; Irene M Stratton; Alice S. Forster,"Objectives Non-attendance at diabetic retinopathy screening has financial implications for screening programmes and potential clinical costs to patients. We sought to identify explanations for why patients had never attended a screening appointment (never attendance) in one programme.; ; Design Qualitative analysis of a service evaluation.; ; Setting One South London (UK) diabetic eye screening programme.; ; Participants and procedure Patients who had been registered with one screening programme for at least 18 months and who had never attended screening within the programme were contacted by telephone to ascertain why this was the case. Patients’ general practices were also contacted for information about why each patient may not have attended. Framework analysis was used to interpret responses.; ; Results Of the 296 patients, 38 were not eligible for screening and of the 258 eligible patients, 159 were not contactable (31 of these had phone numbers that were not in use). We obtained reasons from patients/general practices/clinical notes for non-attendance for 146 (57%) patients. A number of patient-level and system-level factors were given to explain non-attendance. Patient-level factors included having other commitments, being anxious about screening, not engaging with any diabetes care and being misinformed about screening. System-level factors included miscommunication about where the patient lives, their clinical situation and practical problems that could have been overcome had their existence been shared between programmes.; ; Conclusions This service evaluation provides unique insight into the patient-level and system-level reasons for never attendance at diabetic retinopathy screening. Improved sharing of relevant information between providers has the potential to facilitate increased uptake of screening.

Gething,"The Malaria Atlas Project (MAP) has worked to assemble and maintain a global open-access database of spatial malariometric data for over a decade. This data spans various formats and topics, including: geo-located surveys of malaria parasite rate; global administrative boundary shapefiles; and global and regional rasters representing the distribution of malaria and associated illnesses, blood disorders, and intervention coverage. MAP has recently released malariaAtlas, an R package providing a direct interface to MAP’s routinely-updated malariometric databases and research outputs. The current paper reviews the functionality available in malariaAtlas and highlights its utility for spatial epidemiological analysis of malaria. malariaAtlas enables users to freely download, visualise and analyse global malariometric data within R. Currently available data types include: malaria parasite rate and vector occurrence point data; subnational administrative boundary shapefiles; and a large suite of rasters covering a diverse range of metrics related to malaria research. malariaAtlas is here used in two mock analyses to illustrate how this data may be incorporated into a standard R workflow for spatial analysis. malariaAtlas is the first open-access R-interface to malariometric data, providing a new and reproducible means of accessing such data within a freely available and commonly used statistical software environment. In this way, the malariaAtlas package aims to contribute to the environment of data-sharing within the malaria research community.",17,1,352,352,Shapefile; Data type; Workflow; Atlas (topology); Malaria; R interface; Download; R package; Computer science; Cartography,Malaria; Malariometric data; Open-access; Parasite rate; R package,"Animal Distribution; Animals; Anopheles/parasitology; Databases, Factual; Humans; Incidence; Malaria/epidemiology; Mosquito Vectors/parasitology; Prevalence; Software",,Medical Research Council (MR/R015600/1) United Kingdom; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1106023) United States,https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/926086 https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/publications/926086 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6173876 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12936-018-2500-5.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30290815/ https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-018-2500-5 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/926086 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6173876 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30290815 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs12936-018-2500-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-018-2500-5,30290815,10.1186/s12936-018-2500-5,2894635702,PMC6173876,0,002-479-486-577-678; 005-715-825-450-139; 008-825-106-579-151; 012-547-530-111-547; 012-622-693-315-437; 015-039-358-123-72X; 016-305-117-891-280; 017-093-450-296-578; 017-989-834-098-185; 018-825-081-570-638; 021-315-484-868-947; 022-418-119-073-474; 029-503-484-934-237; 039-485-484-203-553; 043-825-609-181-048; 044-675-860-680-766; 045-555-466-426-698; 046-351-287-221-592; 049-952-546-915-867; 051-680-799-332-681; 051-859-947-320-317; 061-283-138-530-705; 069-274-862-825-711; 069-814-570-041-514; 071-006-097-473-595; 073-215-015-587-796; 074-087-842-888-624; 074-628-530-205-096; 077-214-452-269-930; 077-636-611-574-618; 087-000-886-929-448; 090-879-173-025-033; 091-150-059-645-650; 103-216-170-845-733; 114-251-883-659-335; 133-429-425-335-880; 136-059-696-943-806; 145-150-841-628-815; 152-247-714-582-054; 156-657-905-001-424; 160-342-826-593-204; 172-426-435-112-905; 184-928-406-785-655,46

Using individual participant data meta-analysis to establish for whom programmes are effective and cost-effective,,2017,journal article,Public Health Research,20504381; 2050439x,National Institute for Health Research,,Frances Gardner; Patty Leijten; Joanna Mann; Sabine Landau; Victoria Harris; Jennifer Beecham; Eva-Maria Bonin; Judy Hutchings; Stephen Scott,"Background Child disruptive behavioural problems are a large and costly public health problem. The Incredible Years® (IY) parenting programme has been disseminated across the UK to prevent this problem and shown to be effective in several trials. It is vital for policy to know for which families IY is most effective, to be sure that it helps reduce, rather than widen, socioeconomic inequalities. Individual trials lack power and generalisability to examine differential effects; conventional meta-analysis lacks information about within-trial variability in effects. Objectives To overcome these limitations by pooling individual-level data from the IY parenting trials in Europe to examine to what extent it benefits socially disadvantaged families. Secondary objectives examine (1) additional moderators of effects on child behaviour, (2) wider health benefits and potential harms and (3) costs, cost-effectiveness and potential long-term savings. Design Individual participant data meta-analysis of 14 randomised trials of the IY parenting intervention. Settings UK (eight trials), the Netherlands, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal. Participants Data were from 1799 families, with children aged 2–10 years (mean 5.1 years; 63% boys). Interventions IY Basic parenting programme. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was disruptive child behaviour, determined by the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory Intensity scale (ECBI-I). Secondary outcomes included self-reported parenting practices, parenting stress, mental health, children’s attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and emotional symptoms. Results There were no differential effects of IY on disruptive behaviour in families with different levels of social/socioeconomic disadvantage or differential effects for ethnic minority families, families with different parenting styles, or for children with comorbid ADHD or emotional problems or of different ages. Some moderators were found: intervention effects were strongest in children with more severe baseline disruptive behaviour, in boys, and in children with parents who were more depressed. Wider health benefits included reduced child ADHD symptoms, greater parental use of praise, and reduced harsh and inconsistent discipline. The intervention did not improve parental depression, stress, self-efficacy or children’s emotional problems. Economic data were available for five UK and Ireland trials (maximum n = 608). The average cost per person of the IY intervention was £2414. The probability that the IY intervention is considered cost-effective is 99% at a willingness to pay of £145 per 1-point improvement on the ECBI-I. Estimated longer-term savings over 20 years range from £1000 to £8400 per child, probably offsetting the cost of the intervention. Limitations Limitations include a focus on one parenting programme; the need to make assumptions in harmonising data; and the fact that data addressed equalities in the effectiveness of, not access to, the intervention. Conclusions There is no evidence that the benefits of the IY parenting intervention are reduced in disadvantaged or minority families; benefits are greater in the most distressed families, including parents who are depressed. Thus, the intervention is unlikely to widen socioeconomic inequalities in disruptive behaviour and may have effects in narrowing inequalities due to parent depression. It was as likely to be effective for older as for younger children. It has wider benefits for ADHD and parenting and is likely to be considered to be cost-effective. Researchers/funders should encourage data sharing to test equity and other moderator questions for other interventions; further research is needed on enhancing equality of access to interventions.

Price; Sarah Auburn,"The Asia–Pacific region faces formidable challenges in achieving malaria elimination by the proposed target in 2030. Molecular surveillance of Plasmodium parasites can provide important information on malaria transmission and adaptation, which can inform national malaria control programmes (NMCPs) in decision-making processes. In November 2019 a parasite genotyping workshop was held in Jakarta, Indonesia, to review molecular approaches for parasite surveillance and explore ways in which these tools can be integrated into public health systems and inform policy. The meeting was attended by 70 participants from 8 malaria-endemic countries and partners of the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network. The participants acknowledged the utility of multiple use cases for parasite genotyping including: quantifying the prevalence of drug resistant parasites, predicting risks of treatment failure, identifying major routes and reservoirs of infection, monitoring imported malaria and its contribution to local transmission, characterizing the origins and dynamics of malaria outbreaks, and estimating the frequency of Plasmodium vivax relapses. However, the priority of each use case varies with different endemic settings. Although a one-size-fits-all approach to molecular surveillance is unlikely to be applicable across the Asia–Pacific region, consensus on the spectrum of added-value activities will help support data sharing across national boundaries. Knowledge exchange is needed to establish local expertise in different laboratory-based methodologies and bioinformatics processes. Collaborative research involving local and international teams will help maximize the impact of analytical outputs on the operational needs of NMCPs. Research is also needed to explore the cost-effectiveness of genetic epidemiology for different use cases to help to leverage funding for wide-scale implementation. Engagement between NMCPs and local researchers will be critical throughout this process.",19,1,1,20,Public health; Geography; Malaria; Data sharing; Plasmodium vivax; Multiple use; Epidemiological Monitoring;

Primary care has been at the forefront, leading the dramatic surge in the use of telemedicine to deliver care through video consultations.1 2 This ability for telemedicine to deliver care at a distance, and with minimal contact, has been termed ‘ digital personal protective equipment (PPE) ’.3 These successful developments with life-changing consequences have whet the appetite with possibilities. As the context changes to the new ‘normal’, there is a growing determination to sustain and embed, rather than return to old ways of working. Although the shift to a care environment where virtual models of healthcare service delivery can be expected to increase, even predominate, the need to allow for human contact will remain an important, if not vital, consideration.; ; We draw on our technology innovation research and wider scholarship in management to suggest two key strategies to sustain the momentum towards increasingly virtual models of care. First, the need to foster the joining up of care that has recently been catalysed through increased interoperability, data sharing and meaningful use. Second, together working that involves a shared leadership approach to service delivery. Such working towards a shared purpose has been fostered in the recent crisis where leaders sought to restore a sense of collective action, helping everyone realise we are in this together, working towards a common goal.; ; The need for ‘joined-up thinking’ in healthcare is well established. Healthcare is delivered by a diverse set of stakeholders including primary, secondary and social care as well as those across local, regional and national levels. In addition, many chronic disease management pathways involve patients …",5,1,leader,2020-000304,Business; Health care; Collective action; Scholarship; Telemedicine; Data sharing; Context (language use); Public relations; Service delivery framework; Shared leadership,,,,National Institute for Health Research,http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/140090/ https://bmjleader.bmj.com/content/early/2020/07/15/leader-2020-000304 https://bmjleader.bmj.com/content/leader/5/1/36.full.pdf https://bmjleader.bmj.com/content/5/1/36 https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-000304 https://bmjleader.bmj.com/content/early/2020/07/15/leader-2020-000304.altmetrics https://core.ac.uk/download/327952606.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-000304,,10.1136/leader-2020-000304,3042761311,,0,004-732-499-985-039; 010-369-456-360-315; 020-517-300-255-038; 021-452-048-275-96X; 025-575-272-268-196; 026-652-316-580-724; 033-854-741-542-015; 051-318-093-003-26X; 054-958-630-540-787; 063-410-297-450-683; 067-481-889-463-852; 087-368-124-965-042; 109-262-827-995-417; 113-252-539-034-254; 147-913-128-146-234; 148-435-957-086-032; 158-827-206-013-962; 162-850-852-119-18X,1

Ultimately, what makes a ‘good’ explanation is a focus not only for the designers and developers of AI systems, but for many disciplines, including law, philosophy, psychology, history, sociology and human-computer interaction. Given that the generation of compliant, valid and effective explanations for AI requires a high-level of critical, interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration, this area is therefore of particular interest for Web Science. The workshop ‘Explanations for AI: Computable or Not?’ (exAI’20) aims to bring together researchers, practitioners and representatives of those subjected to socially-sensitive decision-making to exchange ideas, methods and challenges as part of an interdisciplinary discussion on explanations for AI. It is hoped that this workshop will build a cross-sectoral, multi-disciplinary and international network of people focusing on explanations for AI, and an agenda to drive this work forward. exAI’20 will hold two position paper sessions, where the panel members and workshop attendees will debate the following key issues in an interactive dialogue: The sessions are hoped to stimulate a lively debate on whether explanations for AI are computable or not by providing time for an interactive discussion after each paper. The discussion will uncover key arguments for and against the computability of explanations for AI related to socially-sensitive decision-making. An introductory keynote from the team behind the project PLEAD (Provenance-Driven & Legally Grounded Explanations for Automated Decisions) will present use cases, scenarios and the practical experience of explanations for AI. The keynote will serve as a starting point for the discussions during the paper sessions about the rationale, technologies and/or organisations measures used; and, accounts from different perspectives – e.g. software designers, implementers and those subject to automated decision-making. By the end of this workshop, attendees will have gained a good insight into the critiques and the advantages of explanations for AI, including the extent in which explanations can or should be made computable. They will have the opportunity to participate and inform the discussions on complex topics about AI explainability, such as the legal requirements for explanations, the extent in which data ethics may drive explanations for AI, reflections on the similarities and differences of explanations for AI decisions and manual decisions, as well as what makes a ‘good’ explanation and the etymology of explanations for socially-sensitive decisions. exAI’20 is supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant number EP/S027238/1].

However, gaps in our understanding of the causes, extent and distribution of these effects remain. The public health community in Sandwell West Midlands has collaborated to successfully develop, pilot and establish the first Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) programme in Europe to address this 'environmental health gap' through systematically linking data on environmental hazards, exposures and diseases. Methods Existing networks of environmental, health and regulatory agencies developed a suite of innovative methods to routinely share, integrate and analyse data on hazards, exposures and health outcomes to inform interventions. Results Effective data sharing and horizon scanning systems have been established, novel statistical methods piloted, plausible associations framed and tested, and targeted interventions informed by local concerns applied. These have influenced changes in public health practice. Conclusion EPHT is a powerful tool for identifying and addressing the key environmental public health impacts at a local level. Sandwell's experience demonstrates that it can be established and operated at virtually no cost. The transfer of National Health Service epidemiological skills to local authorities in 2013 provides an opportunity to expand the programme to fully exploit its potential.",39,3,506,513,Epidemiology; Public health; Business; Exploit; Psychological intervention; Tracking (education); Data sharing; Health impact assessment; Distribution (economics); Environmental health,environment; epidemiology; health impact assessment,Cost-Benefit Analysis; England; Environmental Exposure/adverse effects; Environmental Health/economics; Food Safety; Humans; Public Health Administration/economics; Public Health Practice/economics,,Department of Health (WMCLAHRC-2014-1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896603 https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/files/71972714/Response_to_Reviewers_Tracking_s1_ln24830127_1213284721_1939656818Hwf_707575500IdV183675224224830127PDF_HI0001.pdf https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article-abstract/39/3/506/2625261 https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/environmental-public-health-tracking(82973ae3-8720-4721-a7e9-644d5859cf23).html http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5896603 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/267317714.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdw130,27908973,10.1093/pubmed/fdw130,2560103415,PMC5896603,0,004-917-911-575-180; 006-297-267-911-689; 007-599-814-007-50X; 022-062-131-182-61X; 023-716-835-796-210; 033-280-679-885-956; 047-229-121-484-621; 130-187-059-500-314; 131-532-993-615-162; 139-786-229-553-008; 172-265-271-486-577,5

Strengthening national preparedness requires National Public Health Institutes (NPHIs), or their equivalent, to overcome practical challenges affecting timely access to, and use of, data that is critical to preparedness. Our situational analysis in collaboration with NPHIs in three countries-Ethiopia, Nigeria and Pakistan-characterises these challenges. Our findings indicate that NPHIs' role necessitates collection and analysis of data from multiple sources that do not routinely share data with public health authorities. Since initiating requests for access to new data sources can be a lengthy process, it is essential that NPHIs are routinely monitoring a broad set of priority indicators that are selected to reflect the country-specific context. NPHIs must also have the authority to be able to request rapid sharing of data from public and private sector organisations during health emergencies and to access additional human and financial resources during disease outbreaks. Finally, timely, transparent and informative communication of synthesised data from NPHIs will facilitate sustained data sharing with NPHIs from external organisations. These actions identified by our analysis will support the availability of robust information systems that allow relevant data to be collected, shared and analysed by NPHIs sufficiently rapidly to inform a timely local response to infectious disease outbreaks in the future.",5,9,e002830,,Private sector; Public health; Business; Situation analysis; Information system; Preparedness; Data sharing; Context (language use); Public relations; Health policy,health policy; health systems; prevention strategies; public health,"Access to Information; Betacoronavirus; COVID-19; Communicable Disease Control/organization & administration; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Disaster Planning; Disease Outbreaks/prevention & control; Ethiopia/epidemiology; Humans; Nigeria/epidemiology; Pakistan/epidemiology; Pandemics/prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Public Health Practice; SARS-CoV-2",,Public Health England,https://gh.bmj.com/content/5/9/e002830 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4658795/ https://khepri-node.dev.meta-infra.org/papers/using-critical-information-to-strengthen-pandemic/32994228 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7526302 https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002830 http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002830 https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/5/9/e002830.full.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32994228/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002830,32994228,10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002830,3090213269,PMC7526302,0,002-969-526-005-386; 004-745-425-327-407; 008-821-027-900-13X; 012-700-542-181-030; 017-913-452-307-26X; 018-351-724-479-714; 024-015-253-255-144; 042-386-415-464-535; 047-931-126-630-608; 059-688-830-832-033; 070-970-822-952-69X; 081-118-560-654-582; 138-889-006-485-576,9

Trotman; Mercy J. Borbor-Cordova,"Background ; Small island developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean region are challenged with managing the health outcomes of a changing climate. Health and climate sectors have partnered to co-develop climate services to improve the management of emerging arboviral diseases (e.g., dengue fever), for example, through the development of climate-driven early warning systems. The objective of this study was to identify health and climate stakeholder perceptions and needs in the Caribbean, with respect to the development of climate services for arboviruses.; ; ; Methods ; Stakeholders included public decision makers and practitioners from the climate and health sectors at the regional (Caribbean) level and from the countries of Dominica and Barbados. From April to June 2017, we conducted interviews (n = 41), surveys (n = 32), and national workshops with stakeholders. Survey responses were tabulated, and audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using qualitative coding to identify responses by research topic, country/region, and sector.; ; ; Results ; Health practitioners indicated that their jurisdiction is currently experiencing an increased risk of arboviral diseases associated with climate variability, and most anticipated that this risk will increase in the future. National health sectors reported financial limitations and a lack of technical expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), statistics, and modeling, which constrained their ability to implement climate services for arboviruses. National climate sectors were constrained by a lack of personnel. Stakeholders highlighted the need to strengthen partnerships with the private sector, academia, and civil society. They identified a gap in local research on climate-arbovirus linkages, which constrained the ability of the health sector to make informed decisions. Strategies to strengthen the climate-health partnership included a top-down approach by engaging senior leadership, multi-lateral collaboration agreements, national committees on climate and health, and shared spaces of dialogue. Mechanisms for mainstreaming climate services for health operations to control arboviruses included climatic-health bulletins and an online GIS platform that would allow for regional data sharing and the generation of spatiotemporal epidemic forecasts. Stakeholders identified a 3-month forecast of arboviral illness as the optimal time frame for an epidemic forecast.; ; ; Conclusions ; These findings support the creation of interdisciplinary and intersectoral ‘communities of practice’ and the co-design of climate services for the Caribbean public health sector. By fostering the effective use of climate information within health policy, research and practice, nations will have greater capacity to adapt to a changing climate.",13,10,e0007772,,Private sector; Climate change; Public health; Business; Public sector; Small Island Developing States; Stakeholder; Health policy; Economic growth; General partnership,,Adolescent; Adult; Aedes/virology; Aged; Animals; Arbovirus Infections/prevention & control; Barbados; Climate Change; Communicable Disease Control; Communicable Diseases/epidemiology; Delivery of Health Care; Dengue/prevention & control; Disease Vectors; Dominica; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Public Health; Public Sector; Stakeholder Participation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,,United States Agency for International Development; Royal Society,https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007772 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31658267/ https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/4655041/ https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0007772&type=printable https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0007772 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6837543/ https://core.ac.uk/download/237396885.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007772,31658267,10.1371/journal.pntd.0007772,2981994148,PMC6837543,0,000-545-702-773-228; 002-554-254-822-491; 004-681-754-596-026; 005-994-496-386-272; 006-201-481-786-218; 008-694-044-883-563; 008-731-791-331-519; 008-838-254-784-328; 009-797-277-577-354; 009-996-536-361-139; 013-541-228-858-171; 016-895-873-000-503; 017-538-116-871-417; 021-574-398-693-040; 027-798-631-964-195; 031-400-953-350-42X; 034-990-499-346-755; 036-944-512-909-475; 037-058-070-060-899; 043-005-920-614-543; 048-291-971-704-495; 048-434-117-335-075; 049-097-865-172-613; 051-229-679-266-409; 051-466-195-467-852; 052-535-898-659-597; 054-261-690-499-421; 054-865-406-071-637; 055-639-261-208-655; 059-147-561-505-47X; 063-552-865-081-681; 067-146-292-772-742; 068-412-269-177-123; 071-844-492-662-719; 074-458-508-881-267; 074-548-698-036-513; 074-645-394-887-495; 075-688-031-261-692; 082-781-841-147-998; 089-135-221-501-085; 098-670-622-716-723; 108-755-108-640-299; 109-988-362-809-946; 112-623-982-753-249; 115-086-819-115-288; 121-673-069-103-563; 132-207-676-555-968; 132-753-279-761-897; 138-630-907-120-109; 139-851-086-988-837; 141-027-445-173-143; 150-781-656-455-643,9

However, the “quality” of health-related DCEs has come under criticism due to the lack of rigour in conducting and reporting some aspects of the design process such as attribute and level development. Superficially selecting attributes and levels and vaguely reporting the process might result in misspecification of attributes which may, in turn, bias the study and misinform policy. To address these concerns, we meticulously conducted and report our systematic attribute development and level selection process for a DCE to elicit the preferences of health care providers for the attributes of a capitation payment mechanism in Kenya. We used a four-stage process proposed by Helter and Boehler to conduct and report the attribute development and level selection process. The process entailed raw data collection, data reduction, removing inappropriate attributes, and wording of attributes. Raw data was collected through a literature review and a qualitative study. Data was reduced to a long list of attributes which were then screened for appropriateness by a panel of experts. The resulting attributes and levels were worded and pretested in a pilot study. Revisions were made and a final list of attributes and levels decided. The literature review unearthed seven attributes of provider payment mechanisms while the qualitative study uncovered 10 capitation attributes. Then, inappropriate attributes were removed using criteria such as salience, correlation, plausibility, and capability of being traded. The resulting five attributes were worded appropriately and pretested in a pilot study with 31 respondents. The pilot study results were used to make revisions. Finally, four attributes were established for the DCE, namely, payment schedule, timeliness of payments, capitation rate per individual per year, and services to be paid by the capitation rate. By rigorously conducting and reporting the process of attribute development and level selection of our DCE,we improved transparency and helped researchers judge the quality.",9,1,1,19,Raw data; Payment; Health care; Actuarial science; Capitation; Payment schedule; Preference elicitation; Quality (business); Health services research; Computer science,Attribute development; Capitation; Discrete choice experiment; Kenya; Provider payment mechanisms; Sub-Saharan Africa,,,Wellcome Trust Intermediate Fellowship (101082); Wellcome Trust Training Fellowship (107527); Wellcome Trust core grant (092654),https://doaj.org/article/5fe50918c82c46c9b638a311530e5bd8 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/1069882 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6822414 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs13561-019-0247-5.pdf https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/publications/1069882 https://paperity.org/p/232592199/attribute-development-and-level-selection-for-a-discrete-choice-experiment-to-elicit-the https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13561-019-0247-5 https://healtheconomicsreview.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13561-019-0247-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13561-019-0247-5,31667632,10.1186/s13561-019-0247-5,2982303811,PMC6822414,0,000-210-084-213-201; 004-843-422-351-670; 004-844-046-162-378; 008-232-855-984-206; 008-381-494-480-609; 012-417-175-270-491; 012-530-262-572-839; 013-813-279-154-883; 013-906-861-414-25X; 018-738-216-581-09X; 021-435-127-907-377; 025-635-278-092-146; 026-582-284-480-399; 026-945-522-230-898; 029-052-635-739-608; 031-394-590-968-707; 032-448-040-217-017; 034-319-410-996-321; 036-128-068-279-650; 041-932-788-704-027; 041-956-011-279-822; 041-960-325-536-82X; 042-402-116-931-719; 042-627-416-303-850; 042-687-663-655-030; 043-338-665-300-277; 044-406-060-226-666; 045-340-286-204-010; 046-130-920-224-256; 046-357-066-377-486; 050-013-832-844-393; 050-721-948-524-639; 052-343-470-867-17X; 055-569-482-888-403; 056-730-166-624-128; 057-276-487-532-901; 057-657-809-679-383; 065-846-986-492-627; 069-615-467-269-252; 072-231-542-835-88X; 073-399-119-838-421; 073-556-658-214-534; 075-203-518-260-95X; 086-750-258-919-691; 093-250-526-400-304; 095-307-042-235-805; 098-907-539-621-371; 107-318-578-371-810; 108-006-825-977-996; 108-232-425-877-596; 113-838-341-288-433; 114-485-170-241-301; 116-411-055-251-767; 117-230-617-699-971; 118-596-261-592-040; 123-101-666-763-657; 136-439-949-162-915; 138-097-943-457-267; 140-371-474-537-950; 146-900-649-338-603; 153-459-178-843-29X; 160-441-821-953-411; 165-667-065-979-942; 179-654-591-020-075; 187-809-618-014-622,9

Tully,"Background: Social media provides the potential to engage a wide audience about scientific research, including the public. However, little empirical research exists to guide health scientists regarding what works and how to optimize impact. We examined the social media campaign #datasaveslives established in 2014 to highlight positive examples of the use and reuse of health data in research.; Objective: This study aims to examine how the #datasaveslives hashtag was used on social media, how often, and by whom; thus, we aim to provide insights into the impact of a major social media campaign in the UK health informatics research community and further afield.; Methods: We analyzed all publicly available posts (tweets) that included the hashtag #datasaveslives (N=13,895) on the microblogging platform Twitter between September 1, 2016, and August 31, 2017. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses, we determined the frequency and purpose of tweets. Social network analysis was used to analyze and visualize tweet sharing (retweet) networks among hashtag users.; Results: Overall, we found 4175 original posts and 9720 retweets featuring #datasaveslives by 3649 unique Twitter users. In total, 66.01% (2756/4175) of the original posts were retweeted at least once. Higher frequencies of tweets were observed during the weeks of prominent policy publications, popular conferences, and public engagement events. Cluster analysis based on retweet relationships revealed an interconnected series of groups of #datasaveslives users in academia, health services and policy, and charities and patient networks. Thematic analysis of tweets showed that #datasaveslives was used for a broader range of purposes than indexing information, including event reporting, encouraging participation and action, and showing personal support for data sharing.; Conclusions: This study shows that a hashtag-based social media campaign was effective in encouraging a wide audience of stakeholders to disseminate positive examples of health research. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the campaign supported community building and bridging practices within and between the interdisciplinary sectors related to the field of health data science and encouraged individuals to demonstrate personal support for sharing health data.",23,2,e16348,,Social network analysis; Empirical research; Microblogging; Sociology; Health informatics; Data sharing; Public relations; Social media; Community building; Thematic analysis,medical research; public engagement; social media; social network analysis,Biomedical Research/methods; Humans; Information Dissemination/methods; Social Media/standards; Social Network Analysis,,Medical Research Council (MR/S004025/1) United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33591280/ https://doaj.org/article/608b0350c23c496cbe89ffc4cfb211b7 https://www.jmir.org/2021/2/e16348 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/datasaveslives-mixed-methods-analysis-of-a-social-media-campaign-to-promote-the-benefits-of-using-health-data-for-research-purposes(e5bbc579-3e5f-49c6-bd8d-639637d56067).html https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/16348 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591280 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7925154 http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/16348,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/16348,33591280,10.2196/16348,3113018479,PMC7925154,0,000-222-544-514-872; 002-427-414-127-788; 012-399-872-558-240; 015-692-170-714-052; 022-654-070-571-396; 024-333-789-579-773; 024-572-211-050-986; 025-275-246-561-108; 028-202-285-047-680; 028-668-948-556-190; 029-669-403-413-991; 030-065-697-283-069; 033-206-089-158-382; 037-550-015-414-716; 039-436-435-369-054; 040-047-705-785-207; 040-252-626-797-747; 043-476-450-776-10X; 044-625-453-430-289; 050-651-679-994-163; 050-702-322-891-353; 052-537-745-195-655; 053-144-964-894-842; 054-925-566-589-47X; 068-656-351-181-026; 069-109-471-571-532; 071-629-435-717-021; 072-650-984-178-844; 089-153-162-829-732; 102-276-478-923-871; 115-252-789-091-270; 137-878-788-503-838; 139-651-430-124-012; 157-243-995-124-482; 162-725-859-796-180,0

L. P. Thomas; Gary A. Eiceman,"Differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) is currently being used for environmental monitoring of space craft atmospheres and has been proposed for the rapid assessment of patients at accident and emergency receptions. Three studies investigated hitherto undescribed complexity in the DMS spectra of methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol and butan-1-ol product ions formed from a 63Ni ionisation source. 54000 DMS spectra obtained over a concentration range of 0.01 mg m−3(g) to 1.80 g m−3(g) revealed the phenomenon of auto-modification of the product ions. This occurred when the neutral vapour concentration exceeded the level required to induce a neutral-ion collision during the low field portion of the dispersion field waveform. Further, post-ionisation cluster-ion formation or protonated monomer/proton bound dimer inter-conversion within the ion-filter was indicated by apparent shifts in the values of the protonated monomer compensation field maximum; indicative of post-ionisation conversion of the protonated monomer to a proton-bound dimer. APCI-DMS-quadrupole mass spectrometry studies enabled the ion dissociation products from dispersion-field heating to be monitored and product ion fragmentation relationships to be proposed. Methanol was not observed to dissociate, while propan-1-ol and butan-1-ol underwent dissociation reactions consistent with dehydration processes that led ultimately to the generation of what is tentatively assigned as a cyclo-C3H3+ ion (m/z 39) and hydrated protons. Studies of the interaction of ion filter temperature with dispersion-field heating of product ions isolated dissociation/fragmentation product ions that have not been previously described in DMS. The implications of these combined findings with regard to data sharing and data interpretation were highlighted.",141,15,4587,4598,Dissociation (chemistry); Analytical chemistry; Ion; Physical chemistry; Mass spectrometry; Monomer; Collision-induced dissociation; Chemistry; Dimer; Fragmentation (mass spectrometry); Protonation,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/an/c6an00435k#! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27227997 http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C6AN00435K https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Fragmentation_auto-modification_and_post_ionisation_proton_bound_dimer_ion_formation_the_differential_mobility_spectrometry_of_low_molecular_weight_alcohols_/9394319 https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Fragmentation_auto-modification_and_post_ionisation_proton_bound_dimer_ion_formation_the_differential_mobility_spectrometry_of_low_molecular_weight_alcohols_/9394319 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27227997 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016Ana...141.4587R/abstract https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/21600/1/2016%20Analyst%20DMS%20and%20Alcohols%20DOI%2010.1039%20C6AN00435K.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6an00435k,27227997,10.1039/c6an00435k,2402186878,,0,000-332-432-115-145; 000-590-766-446-958; 000-611-260-183-345; 005-613-676-977-115; 009-086-125-618-814; 011-106-962-669-35X; 019-457-002-224-818; 023-656-455-404-092; 024-471-654-519-867; 028-782-301-832-552; 029-728-497-410-851; 032-564-073-447-714; 036-227-546-850-721; 038-962-672-531-661; 039-983-511-029-039; 044-494-707-944-582; 045-280-074-355-421; 050-733-274-152-741; 060-593-080-179-832; 067-382-610-926-570; 068-803-216-163-295; 071-139-342-181-844; 077-481-957-697-005; 083-486-674-851-383; 086-499-050-757-489; 088-872-086-578-832; 101-907-103-029-621; 115-549-848-636-478; 119-897-911-093-899; 122-812-162-650-362; 155-662-974-257-618; 157-689-331-850-007; 188-507-916-002-956; 188-526-773-950-011,8

Such practices are perceived to have the potential to promote science by maximising the utility of data and samples. However, they also raise ethical challenges which can be exacerbated by existing disparities in power, infrastructure and capacity. The Global Forum on Bioethics in Research (GFBR) convened in Stellenbosch, South Africa in November 2018, to explore the ethics of data sharing and biobanking in health research. Ninety-five participants from 35 countries drew on case studies and their experiences with sharing in their discussion of issues relating to respecting research participants and communities, promoting equitable sharing, and international and national approaches to governing data sharing and biobanking.

Jones; Helen Daniels; Sharon Heys; Arron Lacey; David V. Ford,"Background: Research using genomic data opens up new insights into health and disease. Being able to use the data in association with health and administrative record data held in safe havens can multiply the benefits. However, there is much discussion about the use of genomic data with perceptions of particular challenges in doing so safely and effectively.; Objective: This study aimed to work toward a risk-utility data governance framework for research using genomic and phenotypic data in an anonymized form for research in safe havens.; Methods: We carried out a multifaceted review drawing upon data governance arrangements in published research, case studies of organizations working with genomic and phenotypic data, public views and expectations, and example studies using genomic and phenotypic data in combination. The findings were contextualized against a backdrop of legislative and regulatory requirements and used to create recommendations.; Results: We proposed recommendations toward a risk-utility model with a flexible suite of controls to safeguard privacy and retain data utility for research. These were presented as overarching principles aligned to the core elements in the data sharing framework produced by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health and as practical control measures distilled from published literature and case studies of operational safe havens to be applied as required at a project-specific level.; Conclusions: The recommendations presented can be used to contribute toward a proportionate data governance framework to promote the safe, socially acceptable use of genomic and phenotypic data in safe havens. They do not purport to eradicate risk but propose case-by-case assessment with transparency and accountability. If the risks are adequately understood and mitigated, there should be no reason that linked genomic and phenotypic data should not be used in an anonymized form for research in safe havens.",22,5,e16346,,Acceptable use policy; Business; Work (electrical); Data governance; Control (management); Accountability; Data sharing; Transparency (behavior); Knowledge management; Legislature,data governance; data safe havens; genomic data,Genomics/methods; Humans; Phenotype,,Medical Research Council (MC_PC_16035) United Kingdom,https://www.jmir.org/2020/5/e16346 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7260661 https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa53556/Download/53556__17331__7cdd48c4c4144fcab6e969e457c90b59.pdf https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa53556 https://core.ac.uk/download/323303244.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/16346,32412420,10.2196/16346,3004019398,PMC7260661,0,000-961-013-537-409; 002-637-506-591-946; 004-327-571-567-853; 005-735-377-882-218; 006-258-632-472-484; 006-428-366-908-984; 010-232-055-736-062; 021-719-302-615-035; 026-354-057-561-047; 026-781-857-807-996; 028-245-672-040-147; 030-124-715-447-600; 033-995-415-699-307; 035-063-567-090-181; 036-507-929-674-311; 041-052-109-925-544; 041-843-923-543-488; 044-810-074-278-218; 047-963-833-291-998; 051-803-058-270-919; 057-444-941-334-228; 057-553-839-178-110; 078-991-754-109-310; 088-945-626-748-447; 089-807-316-021-753; 090-736-758-005-46X; 108-209-358-578-995; 110-044-842-405-083; 122-927-550-216-410; 124-269-625-698-030; 125-953-862-796-491,5

Bishop; Demetris Avraam; Xavier Escriba-Montagut; Patricia Ryser-Welch; Stuart Wheater; Paul Burton; Juan R. González,"Combined analysis of multiple, large datasets is a common objective in the health- and biosciences. Existing methods tend to require researchers to physically bring data together in one place or follow an analysis plan and share results. Developed over the last 10 years, the DataSHIELD platform is a collection of R packages that reduce the challenges of these methods. These include ethico-legal constraints which limit researchers' ability to physically bring data together and the analytical inflexibility associated with conventional approaches to sharing results. The key feature of DataSHIELD is that data from research studies stay on a server at each of the institutions that are responsible for the data. Each institution has control over who can access their data. The platform allows an analyst to pass commands to each server and the analyst receives results that do not disclose the individual-level data of any study participants. DataSHIELD uses Opal which is a data integration system used by epidemiological studies and developed by the OBiBa open source project in the domain of bioinformatics. However, until now the analysis of big data with DataSHIELD has been limited by the storage formats available in Opal and the analysis capabilities available in the DataSHIELD R packages. We present a new architecture (""resources"") for DataSHIELD and Opal to allow large, complex datasets to be used at their original location, in their original format and with external computing facilities. We provide some real big data analysis examples in genomics and geospatial projects. For genomic data analyses, we also illustrate how to extend the resources concept to address specific big data infrastructures such as GA4GH or EGA, and make use of shell commands. Our new infrastructure will help researchers to perform data analyses in a privacy-protected way from existing data sharing initiatives or projects. To help researchers use this framework, we describe selected packages and present an online book (https://isglobal-brge.github.io/resource_bookdown).",17,3,e1008880,,Data management; Domain (software engineering); Data science; Data sharing; Graphical user interface; Computer science; Resource (project management); Data integration; Big data; Geospatial analysis,,"Big Data; Computer Security; Databases, Factual; Genomics; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Software",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (108439/A/15/Z) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (108439/A/15/Z) United Kingdom,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008880 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008880 http://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33784300/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8034722 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PLSCB..17E8880M/abstract https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8034722 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33784300/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008880,33784300,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008880,3151167016,PMC8034722,0,003-325-082-124-319; 005-735-377-882-218; 007-505-319-530-854; 012-703-413-506-007; 012-983-393-441-005; 019-441-721-347-156; 021-112-637-910-844; 026-629-559-633-469; 028-883-542-405-239; 037-026-801-886-429; 038-157-414-709-63X; 055-574-774-155-611; 063-784-235-078-173; 064-006-462-878-408; 075-081-148-336-386; 077-000-636-072-127; 077-568-722-463-88X; 081-016-667-922-551; 094-381-625-194-127; 099-752-135-118-860; 103-466-407-608-181; 106-172-220-452-215; 133-240-882-135-279; 148-556-985-189-670; 161-136-442-675-47X,5

Social media platforms (e.g. Facebook) and information retrieval (IR) systems (e.g. Google), are now in the public spotlight to address these issues. Our research investigates an approach, known as Nudging, applied to the domain of IR, as a potential means to minimize impacts and threats surrounding both matters. We perform our study in the space of health search for two reasons. First, encounters with misinformation in this space have potentially grave outcomes. Second, there are many potential threats to personal privacy as a result of the data collected during a search task. Adopting methods and a corpus from previous work as the foundation, our study asked users to determine the effectiveness of a treatment for 10 medical conditions. Users performed the tasks on 4 variants of a search engine results page (SERP) and a control, with 3 of the SERP's being a Nudge (re-ranking, filtering and a visual cue) intended to reduce impacts to privacy with minimal impact to search result quality. The aim of our work is to determine the Nudge that is least impactful to good decision making while simultaneously increasing privacy protection.

The need for ethical principles and values embodied in international research ethics guidelines to be upheld during public health emergencies is widely recognized. Public health officials, researchers and other concerned stakeholders also have to carefully balance time and resources allocated to immediate treatment and control activities, with an approach that integrates research as part of the outbreak response. Under such circumstances, research “ethics preparedness” constitutes an important foundation for an effective response to infectious disease outbreaks and other health emergencies. A two-day workshop was convened in March 2018 by the World Health Organisation Global Health Ethics Team and the African coaLition for Epidemic Research, Response and Training, with representatives of National Ethics Committees, to identify practical processes and procedures related to ethics review preparedness. The workshop considered five areas where work might be undertaken to facilitate rapid and sound ethics review: preparing national ethics committees for outbreak response; pre-review of protocols; multi-country review; coordination between national ethics committees and other key stakeholders; data and benefit sharing; and export of samples to third countries. In this paper, we present the recommendations that resulted from the workshop. In particular, the participants recommended that Ethics Committees would develop a formal national standard operating procedure for emergency response ethical review; that there is a need to clarify the terminology and expectations of pre-review of generic protocols and agree upon specific terminology; that there is a need to explore mechanisms for multi-country emergency ethical consultation, and to establish procedures for communication between national ethics committees and other oversight bodies and public health authorities. In addition, it was suggested that ethics committees should request from researchers, at a minimum, a preliminary data sharing and sample sharing plan that outlines the benefit to the population from which data and samples are to be drawn. This should be followed in due time by a full plan. It is hoped that the national ethics committees, supported by the WHO, relevant collaborative research consortia and external funding agencies, will work towards bringing these recommendations into practice, for supporting the conduct of effective research during outbreaks.",20,1,29,29,Philosophy of medicine; Public health; Research ethics; Political science; Preparedness; Data sharing; Population; Public relations; Global health; Terminology,Ethics review; Infectious disease outbreaks; Low- and middle-income countries; Pre-review; Rapid review; Research ethics,"Disaster Planning; Disease Outbreaks/ethics; Education; Ethical Review; Ethics Committees, Clinical; Ethics Committees, Research; Humans",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; World Health Organization (001) International; Wellcome Trust (212162/Z/18/Z) United Kingdom,https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12910-019-0366-x https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060618 https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/publications/998474 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6501283 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12910-019-0366-x.pdf https://www.camsoxford.ox.ac.uk/coi-publications/publications/998474 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31060618/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12910-019-0366-x https://philpapers.org/rec/SAXEPF http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31060618 https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs12910-019-0366-x https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6501283/ https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/998474,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12910-019-0366-x,31060618,10.1186/s12910-019-0366-x,2947019289,PMC6501283,0,001-480-383-220-213; 001-901-089-302-421; 006-691-250-071-156; 006-811-518-612-325; 008-056-350-636-791; 008-164-225-901-291; 009-246-388-545-514; 011-964-445-465-034; 012-458-257-629-868; 012-757-056-901-968; 012-796-093-198-628; 015-886-042-042-365; 024-803-376-872-350; 030-754-914-181-610; 038-313-870-043-079; 045-136-480-030-167; 046-613-131-388-297; 048-408-164-892-684; 052-751-530-009-20X; 070-940-015-840-07X; 071-059-098-724-607; 073-192-992-130-980; 075-924-981-748-738; 076-982-572-413-277; 089-396-654-616-641; 097-292-761-989-316; 098-134-529-196-12X; 110-656-670-003-439; 112-378-408-969-815; 125-993-099-887-82X; 126-871-425-351-950,30

Beeken; Kate Williams; Jane Wardle; Helen Croker,"Given the abundance of misreporting about diet and cancer in the media and online, cancer survivors are at risk of misinformation. The aim of this study was to explore cancer survivors' beliefs about diet quality and cancer, the impact on their behaviour and sources of information. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with adult cancer survivors in the United Kingdom who had been diagnosed with any cancer in adulthood and were not currently receiving treatment (n = 19). Interviews were analysed using Thematic Analysis. Emergent themes highlighted that participants were aware of diet affecting risk for the development of cancer, but were less clear about its role in recurrence. Nonetheless, their cancer diagnosis appeared to be a prompt for dietary change; predominantly to promote general health. Changes were generally consistent with healthy eating recommendations, although dietary supplements and other non-evidence-based actions were mentioned. Participants reported that they had not generally received professional advice about diet and were keen to know more, but were often unsure about information from other sources. The views of our participants suggest cancer survivors would welcome guidance from health professionals. Advice that provides clear recommendations, and which emphasises the benefits of healthy eating for overall well-being, may be particularly well-received.",25,5,774,783,Cancer; Qualitative research; Diet and cancer; Misinformation; Dietary change; General health; Healthy eating; Medicine; Thematic analysis; Gerontology,beliefs; cancer survivorship; diet; information; knowledge; media,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude to Health; Diet/adverse effects; Diet, Healthy; Female; Health Status; Humans; Information Services; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms/etiology; Patient Education as Topic; Qualitative Research; Socioeconomic Factors; Survivors/psychology; Young Adult",,Cancer Research UK (14133) United Kingdom,https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/122773/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecc.12529 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4995727/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27349812/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4995727 https://core.ac.uk/display/79524003 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1502682/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ecc.12529 https://core.ac.uk/download/96768016.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecc.12529,27349812,10.1111/ecc.12529,2464903681,PMC4995727,0,000-331-973-775-926; 000-907-366-906-030; 001-480-322-859-208; 001-522-704-751-094; 002-014-975-558-566; 002-391-638-872-291; 005-956-800-091-878; 008-255-998-962-671; 008-422-226-249-871; 008-895-399-223-645; 010-969-846-157-602; 012-089-264-783-854; 012-759-087-500-672; 013-919-556-040-645; 014-285-038-321-900; 014-475-929-033-985; 020-703-621-942-25X; 022-182-641-689-062; 023-809-781-561-565; 026-489-090-580-846; 027-002-921-776-882; 029-966-075-381-695; 033-650-597-120-103; 036-170-007-081-164; 036-689-749-982-202; 037-550-015-414-716; 038-521-918-454-368; 040-988-843-450-071; 041-197-617-177-631; 042-131-883-475-978; 045-716-273-352-885; 046-161-899-035-195; 050-604-565-181-998; 050-766-920-467-31X; 051-671-297-079-52X; 057-599-433-516-654; 059-322-320-289-708; 065-875-538-098-733; 068-778-173-990-976; 070-193-299-282-631; 074-176-797-518-484; 089-094-034-641-228; 091-078-189-585-939; 098-371-414-969-945; 110-669-581-222-763; 113-036-565-367-398; 136-906-611-541-758; 139-743-072-649-49X; 152-599-601-770-672; 168-107-372-087-120; 169-111-937-996-363; 182-422-785-155-491,54

Therapies that intervene early in the disease continuum are a priority for the many candidates in the drug development pipeline. There is a paucity of sensitive and objective, yet clinically interpretable, measures that can capture meaningful aspects of the disease. This poses a major challenge for the development of new therapies and is compounded by the considerable heterogeneity in clinical manifestations across patients and the fluctuating nature of many signs and symptoms of PD. Digital health technologies (DHT), such as smartphone applications, wearable sensors, and digital diaries, have the potential to address many of these gaps by enabling the objective, remote, and frequent measurement of PD signs and symptoms in natural living environments. The current climate of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a heightened sense of urgency for effective implementation of such strategies. In order for these technologies to be adopted in drug development studies, a regulatory-aligned consensus on best practices in implementing appropriate technologies, including the collection, processing, and interpretation of digital sensor data, is required. A growing number of collaborative initiatives are being launched to identify effective ways to advance the use of DHT in PD clinical trials. The Critical Path for Parkinson's Consortium of the Critical Path Institute is highlighted as a case example where stakeholders collectively engaged regulatory agencies on the effective use of DHT in PD clinical trials. Global regulatory agencies, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, are encouraging the efficiencies of data-driven engagements through multistakeholder consortia. To this end, we review how the advancement of DHT can be most effectively achieved by aligning knowledge, expertise, and data sharing in ways that maximize efficiencies.",4,Suppl 1,28,,,Collaboration; Consensus; Device agnostic; Digital health technologies; Public-private partnerships; Regulatory science,,,Medical Research Council (MR/L023784/1) United Kingdom; FDA HHS (U18 FD005320) United States; Parkinson's UK (J-0901) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_EX_MR/N50192X/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/M024962/1) United Kingdom,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33442579,33442579,,,PMC7768153,0,002-982-299-114-131; 004-495-556-200-116; 006-894-211-844-697; 007-969-116-240-22X; 008-951-513-910-099; 009-278-736-814-941; 011-765-483-163-860; 013-098-206-580-46X; 017-144-423-748-353; 019-226-243-174-059; 019-992-971-098-077; 022-579-580-506-503; 023-561-588-794-109; 023-971-984-414-624; 024-050-744-476-869; 024-282-989-136-451; 026-787-228-842-526; 029-347-282-681-866; 029-826-587-479-35X; 030-119-651-292-788; 031-792-576-115-402; 033-635-564-668-476; 035-200-609-528-048; 037-005-366-353-982; 038-847-838-348-119; 042-990-382-780-582; 043-499-707-479-04X; 045-837-020-429-902; 049-196-215-710-743; 052-431-053-867-929; 053-312-146-877-59X; 055-293-336-573-695; 058-580-774-077-748; 062-139-965-322-07X; 063-620-393-057-705; 065-943-332-463-442; 068-055-886-343-833; 069-688-068-951-104; 090-127-614-260-724; 090-266-110-060-93X; 104-091-516-151-713; 121-166-848-037-335; 136-708-958-190-638; 137-060-759-372-786; 153-286-415-016-288,7

The agenda we formulate includes substantial and intellectual priorities concerning intrusive technologies, critical data literacies, labour, co-option and resistance, and argues for the need for research on these matters, in the interest of audiences.",20,2,184,198,Political science; Emerging technologies; Datafication; Context (language use); Resistance (psychoanalysis); Public relations; Social media; Futures studies; Transformative learning; Big data,,,,Arts and Humanities Research Council,https://surrey.eprints-hosting.org/845610/ https://core.ac.uk/display/146460294 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1527476418759604 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1527476418759604 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1527476418759604 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1527476418759604 https://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/845610/ https://core.ac.uk/download/146460294.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1527476418759604,,10.1177/1527476418759604,2784004413,,0,002-959-181-325-747; 005-871-371-921-032; 007-831-303-700-234; 011-737-680-099-433; 020-059-157-930-196; 024-911-494-531-897; 029-752-943-931-383; 036-263-771-381-202; 036-596-019-414-702; 041-757-056-524-260; 043-884-724-967-580; 049-491-250-968-063; 050-720-943-042-556; 052-875-600-647-691; 064-179-180-889-964; 071-655-672-515-043; 073-193-115-650-815; 073-582-609-444-252; 075-665-019-489-692; 077-905-818-633-980; 082-561-017-921-004; 083-320-613-300-123; 092-732-358-879-170; 096-552-889-672-205; 097-920-501-219-344; 109-222-306-527-523; 111-158-351-476-276; 112-424-863-178-93X; 113-279-561-481-085; 113-330-742-659-883; 116-346-426-322-520; 119-942-283-316-245; 120-059-524-499-04X; 120-421-779-531-258; 159-859-335-246-319,11

Inspired by the potential for Dynamic Consent to increase participant choice and autonomy in decision-making, as well as the opportunities for ongoing participant engagement it affords, we wanted to trial Dynamic Consent and to do so developed our own web-based application (web app) called CTRL (control). This paper documents the design and development of CTRL, for use in the Australian Genomics study: a health services research project building evidence to inform the integration of genomic medicine into mainstream healthcare. Australian Genomics brought together a multi-disciplinary team to develop CTRL. The design and development process considered user experience; security and privacy; the application of international standards in data sharing; IT, operational and ethical issues. The CTRL tool is now being offered to participants in the study, who can use CTRL to keep personal and contact details up to date; make consent choices (including indicate preferences for return of results and future research use of biological samples, genomic and health data); follow their progress through the study; complete surveys, contact the researchers and access study news and information. While there are remaining challenges to implementing Dynamic Consent in genomic research, this study demonstrates the feasibility of building such a tool, and its ongoing use will provide evidence about the value of Dynamic Consent in large-scale genomic research programs.",29,4,687,698,Internet privacy; Web application; Psychology; Health care; User experience design; Data sharing; Return of results; Health services research; Autonomy; Informed consent,,Genetic Privacy/psychology; Genomics/methods; Humans; Informed Consent/psychology; Internet; Patient Participation/methods; Software,,Department of Health | National Health and Medical Research Council,http://europepmc.org/article/MED/33408362 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/1488640-'ctrl'--an-online--dynamic-consent-and-participant-engagement-platform-working-towards-solving-the-complexities-of-consent-in-genomic-research https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-020-00782-w.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/s41431-020-00782-w https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/bitstream/handle/11343/279391/s41431-020-00782-w.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115139/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115139/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41431-020-00782-w,33408362,10.1038/s41431-020-00782-w,3121099103,PMC8115139,0,002-233-715-333-627; 003-640-737-597-345; 004-613-862-207-388; 004-845-658-597-879; 008-677-006-944-041; 013-578-523-536-115; 014-185-402-474-754; 014-691-237-394-700; 015-187-161-217-655; 015-858-891-845-535; 016-282-408-493-072; 024-813-342-035-721; 025-307-969-921-06X; 027-062-823-813-525; 042-319-906-827-388; 042-558-635-197-000; 048-247-108-072-011; 052-072-288-289-172; 054-778-926-965-153; 055-772-431-528-938; 062-614-413-535-528; 071-792-970-689-050; 074-448-883-182-67X; 076-478-450-461-817; 096-488-338-988-234; 097-814-523-873-516; 112-754-281-414-869; 122-237-434-824-189; 125-810-717-283-966,6

Population-wide implementation of such analyses is, however, not without challenges, and multiple studies are ongoing to identify what these are and explore how they can be addressed.; ; Methods:; Defined as a research project, the Personal Genome Project UK (PGP-UK) is part of the global PGP network and focuses on open data sharing and citizen science to advance and accelerate personalized genomics and medicine.; ; Results:; Here we report our findings on using an open consent recruitment protocol, active participant involvement, open access release of personal genome, methylome and transcriptome data and associated analyses, including 47 new variants predicted to affect gene function and innovative reports based on the analysis of genetic and epigenetic variants. For this pilot study, we recruited 10 participants willing to actively engage as citizen scientists with the project. In addition, we introduce Genome Donation as a novel mechanism for openly sharing previously restricted data and discuss the first three donations received. Lastly, we present GenoME, a free, open-source educational app suitable for the lay public to allow exploration of personal genomes.; ; Conclusions:; Our findings demonstrate that citizen science-based approaches like PGP-UK have an important role to play in the public awareness, acceptance and implementation of genomics and personalized medicine.",11,1,108,,Psychology; Genomics; Citizen science; Personal Genome Project; Personal genomics; Open data; Personalized medicine; Transformational leadership; Knowledge management; Mechanism (biology),Citizen science; Genome app; Genome donation; Genome reports; Open access; Open consent; Personal genomics,"DNA Methylation; Genome, Human; Genomics; Genotype; Humans; Pilot Projects; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Precision Medicine; United Kingdom; Whole Genome Sequencing",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (99148) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12013/2) United Kingdom; Department of Health (BRC369/CN/SB/101310) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (530912) United Kingdom,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10064119/ https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/ws/files/36473769/12920_2018_423_OnlinePDF_2_.pdf https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/249969 https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/personal-genome-project-uk-pgp-uk-a-research-and-citizen-science- https://research.brighton.ac.uk/en/publications/personal-genome-project-uk-pgp-uk-a-research-and-citizen-science- https://core.ac.uk/download/195283834.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12920-018-0423-1,30482208,10.1186/s12920-018-0423-1,2913229404,PMC6257975,0,002-899-500-373-841; 004-295-809-296-093; 004-946-067-627-59X; 005-978-170-618-328; 006-581-066-120-491; 007-886-408-181-23X; 008-726-646-115-83X; 009-434-675-011-556; 010-963-478-093-707; 011-131-342-244-187; 011-394-758-653-173; 012-393-984-974-962; 012-821-630-084-127; 013-967-389-834-136; 015-172-802-607-820; 015-307-411-123-672; 016-159-010-515-549; 025-316-468-661-524; 025-358-459-950-864; 027-399-149-279-706; 027-742-933-656-371; 029-285-367-187-006; 029-657-032-982-467; 032-804-778-814-369; 032-961-071-116-005; 034-370-285-339-798; 034-422-252-264-891; 042-392-303-534-608; 042-930-159-137-362; 047-733-118-404-224; 048-758-579-692-174; 048-969-864-863-964; 052-853-150-237-953; 053-370-563-090-523; 054-890-691-103-662; 056-548-858-728-859; 056-630-844-182-587; 057-979-280-639-358; 058-394-473-068-89X; 059-200-230-596-637; 062-707-923-047-885; 065-958-273-215-976; 066-800-373-112-727; 067-839-338-447-163; 070-573-816-575-577; 074-467-833-079-969; 075-255-587-657-138; 075-257-623-567-05X; 077-862-043-504-560; 081-734-481-084-453; 086-066-464-292-294; 087-863-982-815-372; 091-938-818-449-524; 095-192-003-252-445; 098-255-317-481-077; 100-066-902-386-852; 104-910-830-286-647; 105-693-589-359-675; 111-670-343-518-90X; 113-595-164-011-180; 120-131-933-505-029; 127-016-670-476-238; 128-964-301-556-474; 135-750-746-451-261; 136-337-798-008-939; 143-072-428-430-254; 145-674-142-826-713; 166-258-785-640-399; 171-202-111-030-656; 188-568-384-292-41X,24

Rapid ethical appraisal (REA) is a tool that uses qualitative methods to explore sociocultural issues that may affect the ethical conduct of research.; ; Methods; We used REA in northeast Ethiopia shortly following a period of unrest, during which violence against researchers occurred, to assess stakeholder perceptions of research, researchers and the informed consent process. We held 32 in-depth interviews and 2 focus group discussions.; ; Results; Most community members had little awareness about podoconiosis or healthcare research. Convincing the community to donate blood for research is challenging due to association with HIV testing. The attack on researchers was mainly motivated by the community's mistrust of their intentions against the background of a volatile political situation. Social media contributed to the spread of misinformation. Lack of community engagement was also a key contributing factor.; ; Conclusions; Using REA, we identified potential barriers to the informed consent process, participant recruitment for data and specimen collection and the smooth conduct of research. Researchers should assess existing conditions in the study area and engage with the community to increase awareness prior to commencing their research activities.",115,9,1026,1038,Ethical code; Psychology; Qualitative research; Stakeholder; Community engagement; Misinformation; Specimen collection; Public relations; Focus group; Informed consent,informed consent; northeast Ethiopia; podoconiosis; rapid ethical appraisal; social instability,Elephantiasis; Ethiopia; Focus Groups; Humans; Informed Consent; Prohibitins; Qualitative Research; Research Personnel,,Department of Health (GHR 16/136/29) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8417087 https://academic.oup.com/trstmh/article/115/9/1026/6133065 http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/96626/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33570141,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/trstmh/trab003,33570141,10.1093/trstmh/trab003,3126490908,PMC8417087,0,002-477-078-207-396; 004-530-955-610-017; 006-222-174-466-372; 006-400-917-591-887; 006-897-765-523-020; 007-091-102-459-009; 007-856-617-469-363; 016-425-722-679-911; 017-077-135-346-854; 031-961-154-720-033; 039-433-883-997-392; 039-981-143-986-740; 043-238-582-252-339; 043-765-867-371-766; 048-272-835-897-161; 053-129-047-648-315; 053-697-403-010-226; 058-268-157-012-037; 058-555-201-051-247; 066-733-315-666-37X; 075-434-996-850-338; 085-627-587-155-987; 085-646-410-867-421; 127-815-609-445-222,0

Accurate recording of SMI during hospital admissions has the potential to facilitate integrated care including tailoring of treatment to account for comorbidities. We therefore aimed to investigate the sensitivity of SMI recording within general hospitals, changes in diagnostic accuracy over time, and factors associated with accurate recording. Methods and findings We undertook a cohort study of 13,786 adults with SMI diagnosed during 2006–2017, using data from a large secondary mental healthcare database as reference standard, linked to English national records for 45,706 emergency hospital admissions. We examined general hospital record sensitivity across patients’ subsequent hospital records, for each subsequent emergency admission, and at different levels of diagnostic precision. We analyzed time trends during the study period and used logistic regression to examine sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with psychiatric recording accuracy, with multiple imputation for missing data. Sensitivity for recording of SMI as any mental health diagnosis was 76.7% (95% CI 76.0–77.4). Category-level sensitivity (e.g., proportion of individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (F20-29) who received any F20-29 diagnosis in hospital records) was 56.4% (95% CI 55.4–57.4) for schizophrenia spectrum disorder and 49.7% (95% CI 48.1–51.3) for bipolar affective disorder. Sensitivity for SMI recording in emergency admissions increased from 47.8% (95% CI 43.1–52.5) in 2006 to 75.4% (95% CI 68.3–81.4) in 2017 (ptrend < 0.001). Minority ethnicity, being married, and having better mental and physical health were associated with less accurate diagnostic recording. The main limitation of our study is the potential for misclassification of diagnosis in the reference-standard mental healthcare data. Conclusions Our findings suggest that there have been improvements in recording of SMI diagnoses, but concerning under-recording, especially in minority ethnic groups, persists. Training in culturally sensitive diagnosis, expansion of liaison psychiatry input in general hospitals, and improved data sharing between physical and mental health services may be required to reduce inequalities in diagnostic practice.",17,9,e1003306,,Mental health; Emergency medicine; Cohort study; Bipolar disorder; Mental illness; Liaison psychiatry; Comorbidity; Medical diagnosis; Medicine; Schizophrenia,,"Comorbidity; Ethnicity; Female; Hospitalization/trends; Hospitals, General; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders/diagnosis; Minority Groups; Primary Health Care/methods; Registries; Socioeconomic Factors; United Kingdom/epidemiology",,Department of Health United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941435 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32941435/ https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003306 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498001 https://www.scilit.net/article/025314c1785cd905b6ac33556e42f5c0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003306,32941435,10.1371/journal.pmed.1003306,3087123293,PMC7498001,0,003-503-688-633-520; 003-755-408-269-973; 005-293-967-207-305; 008-613-255-230-872; 011-138-610-584-834; 013-520-189-096-932; 016-421-889-793-128; 016-619-352-824-792; 017-781-363-990-587; 019-007-885-373-412; 019-103-996-857-911; 019-150-244-068-647; 019-327-871-027-415; 023-987-104-787-905; 030-581-017-576-417; 031-018-960-070-090; 032-866-654-108-343; 033-177-924-968-769; 033-805-323-835-180; 034-157-959-944-837; 034-880-034-531-216; 038-046-756-154-02X; 039-150-761-373-426; 047-722-401-015-538; 048-843-908-332-062; 050-000-226-954-645; 053-659-957-455-991; 060-320-302-419-640; 069-146-147-793-558; 072-242-389-433-836; 078-914-197-165-563; 079-148-609-824-147; 085-555-474-314-064; 094-233-344-037-315; 097-531-888-849-383; 100-632-361-070-479; 104-627-809-714-527; 105-896-993-754-140; 116-850-422-438-297; 121-128-486-711-865; 121-286-686-692-957; 124-103-129-714-441; 132-227-690-920-309; 153-811-109-368-878; 161-092-247-791-596; 171-288-147-881-196; 172-040-117-348-224,1

Weir; Alexander E. P. Heazell; Sonia Whyte; Jane E. Norman,"Friedman and colleagues1 outline a vision of the learning health system founded on the sharing of data and achieved through alignment of information technology, advanced analytics and clinical expertise. The Institute of Medicine2 recognises the potential of the learning health system to generate new information automatically during the delivery of healthcare, offering continual opportunities to improve healthcare processes for the benefit of public health. The learning health system is promoted as a mechanism to accelerate the adoption of effective treatments into clinical practice, shortening the extended delay3 from publication of research findings to implementation. Furthermore, it harbours the ambition to deliver personalised medicine to each service user, rather than the systematic provision of identical care to groups of patients who share the same characteristics. Worldwide escalating costs in healthcare provision due to demographic changes, compounded by ongoing use of ineffective tests and treatments, make it critically important to harness the efficiency gains of a learning health system. Of its many potential characteristics, one distinct attribute of the learning health system is to enable efficient investigation of whether strategies promoting implementation of best practice (such as educational initiatives or care bundles) actually work. A systematic review identifying a low frequency of reports on the evaluation and impact of learning health systems4 prompted us here to reconsider the central requirements for evaluation of improvement interventions within the learning health system.; ; Here, we reflect on two recent implementation studies, both using efficiencies of the learning health system (minimising data acquisition and relying heavily on data acquisition from existing medical records), to illustrate the key issues arising when incorporating this type of research into the learning health system. In this paper, we argue that the presence of infrastructure which facilitates data sharing, combined with appropriate research design, analysis and reporting, …",29,8,696,700,Information technology; Public health; Health care; Best practice; Evidence-based medicine; Data sharing; Health services research; Knowledge management; Medicine; Analytics,cluster trials; evidence-based medicine; health services research; healthcare quality improvement; implementation science,Humans; Learning Health System; Quality Improvement; Research Design,,Chief Scientist Office (CZH/4/882) United Kingdom,https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/early/2020/02/25/bmjqs-2019-010068.full.pdf https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/evaluating-improvement-interventions-using-routine-data-to-support-a-learning-health-system(5844ea0a-fb29-4ea3-8067-c597fdcbe9b0)/export.html https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/files/224389710/LearningHealthSystems_Viewpoint_BMJQualitySafety_R3_submitted_3_.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32098804/ https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/29/8/696 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32098804 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/136613326/Improvement_intervention_evaluations.pdf https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/early/2020/02/25/bmjqs-2019-010068 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/evaluating-improvement-interventions-using-routine-data-to-suppor https://core.ac.uk/download/322484439.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010068,32098804,10.1136/bmjqs-2019-010068,3005629492,,0,009-641-220-979-204; 010-222-991-684-139; 014-003-348-981-404; 015-162-092-047-769; 031-644-880-613-508; 033-132-699-504-060; 045-095-868-146-360; 045-396-953-727-847; 051-615-235-489-906; 052-198-275-882-974; 068-290-271-198-027; 077-980-120-042-388; 087-990-428-545-127; 094-260-131-252-496; 104-295-542-059-456; 108-871-898-399-812; 112-605-568-827-565; 136-911-824-063-813,0

The generation of DP data at scale creates novel challenges for the histopathology community in managing, processing, and governing the use of these data. The current understanding of, and confidence in, the legal and ethical aspects of DP by pathologists is unknown. We developed an electronic survey (e-survey) comprising of 22 questions, which was developed with input from the Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath) Digital Pathology Working Group. The e-survey was circulated via e-mail and social media (Twitter) through the RCPath Digital Pathology Working Group network, RCPath Trainee Committee network, the Pathology image data Lake for Analytics, Knowledge and Education (PathLAKE) digital pathology consortium, National Pathology Imaging Co-operative (NPIC), local contacts, and to the membership of both The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland and the British Division of the International Academy of Pathology (BDIAP). Between 14 July 2020 and 6 September 2020, we collected 198 responses representing a cross section of histopathologists, including individuals with experience of DP research. We ascertained that in the UK, DP is being used for diagnosis, research, and teaching, and that the platform is enabling data sharing. Our survey demonstrated that there is often a lack of confidence and understanding of the key issues of consent, legislation, and ethical guidelines. Of 198 respondents, 82 (41%) did not know when the use of digital scanned slide images would fall under the relevant legislation and 93 (47%) were 'Not confident at all' in their interpretation of consent for scanned slide images in research. With increasing uptake of DP, a working knowledge of these areas is essential but histopathologists often express a lack of confidence in these topics. The need for specific training in these areas is highlighted by the findings of this study.",,,,,,Digital Pathology; ethics; governance; histopathology; legal; training,,,Oxford University; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (BRC); UK Research and Innovation (UKRI); Innovate UK; Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund; PathLAKE Centre of Excellence,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cjp2.251,34796679,10.1002/cjp2.251,,,0,002-380-648-252-439; 003-283-770-097-710; 006-711-629-088-855; 013-067-368-935-065; 015-645-024-989-750; 018-256-748-752-409; 026-742-574-399-548; 031-324-547-794-859; 031-770-168-531-100; 031-882-506-477-319; 049-195-574-259-70X; 049-244-729-586-51X; 049-278-033-665-370; 049-307-736-459-32X; 051-162-594-496-420; 067-540-375-856-322; 068-186-588-808-348; 069-320-165-984-949; 075-934-875-442-056; 086-640-690-632-107; 103-978-794-690-857; 125-861-168-032-944; 167-964-428-073-44X; 174-867-167-873-594,0

Anejionu; Piyushimita Thakuriah; Andrew McHugh; Yeran Sun Sun; David Philip McArthur; Phil Mason; Rod Walpole,"Abstract The Spatial Urban Data System (SUDS) is a spatial big data infrastructure to support UK-wide analytics of the social and economic aspects of cities and city-regions. It utilises data generated from traditional as well as new and emerging sources of urban data. The SUDS deploys geospatial technology, synthetic small area urban metrics, and cloud computing to enable urban analytics, and geovisualization with the goal of deriving actionable knowledge for better urban management and data-driven urban decision making. At the core of the system is a programme of urban indicators generated by using novel forms of data and urban modelling and simulation programme. SUDS differs from other similar systems by its emphasis on the generation and use of regularly updated spatially-activated urban area metrics from real or near-real time data sources, to enhance understanding of intra-city interactions and dynamics. By deploying public transport, labour market accessibility and housing advertisement data in the system, we were able to identify spatial variations of key urban services at intra-city levels as well as social and economically-marginalised output areas in major cities across the UK. This paper discusses the design and implementation of SUDS, the challenges and limitations encountered, and considerations made during its development. The innovative approach adopted in the design of SUDS will enable it to support research and analysis of urban areas, policy and city administration, business decision-making, private sector innovation, and public engagement. Having been tested with housing, transport and employment metrics, efforts are ongoing to integrate information from other sources such as IoT, and User Generated Content into the system to enable urban predictive analytics.",98,,456,473,Private sector; Geovisualization; Geomatics; Data science; Urban area; Computer science; Public transport; Big data; Analytics; Cloud computing; Predictive analytics,,,,Economic and Social Research Council,http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/183602/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/fgcs/fgcs98.html#AnejionuTMSMMW19 https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa53540 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X18319046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.03.052,,10.1016/j.future.2019.03.052,2928704020,,0,005-929-870-002-822; 008-045-993-810-34X; 011-035-754-473-226; 011-789-294-342-794; 012-805-967-968-657; 013-233-550-354-583; 017-292-446-101-215; 023-674-353-590-241; 024-020-983-899-095; 026-823-186-389-174; 041-967-045-938-500; 044-716-368-182-819; 045-052-661-060-201; 045-186-643-340-203; 052-313-793-777-534; 055-486-346-007-217; 056-847-136-848-592; 064-444-094-351-29X; 068-201-598-480-086; 068-477-556-819-704; 070-774-928-465-111; 071-403-235-661-586; 081-947-045-387-22X; 082-078-919-382-257; 084-910-497-954-256; 086-470-411-539-657; 101-392-458-093-50X; 103-352-942-458-570; 106-852-912-725-578; 108-638-973-073-695; 135-589-047-152-766; 159-574-161-496-801; 169-599-808-294-084; 171-506-879-823-664; 197-928-408-552-099,15

Purse,"Smallholder farmer and tribal communities are often characterised as marginalised and highly vulnerable to emerging zoonotic diseases due to their relatively poor access to healthcare, worse-off health outcomes, proximity to sources of disease risks, and their social and livelihood organisation. Yet, access to relevant and timely disease information that could strengthen their adaptive capacity remain challenging and poorly characterised in the empirical literature. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the role of disease information in shaping the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmer and tribal groups to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever. We carried out household surveys (n = 229) and in-depth interviews (n = 25) in two affected districts-Shimoga and Wayanad-in the Western Ghats region. Our findings suggest that, despite the generally limited awareness about KFD, access to disease information improved households' propensity to implement adaptation strategies relative to households that had no access to it. Of the variety of adaptation strategies implemented, vaccination, avoiding forest visits, wearing of protective clothing and footwear, application of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) oil and income diversification were identified by respondents as important adaptive measures during the outbreak seasons. Even so, we identified significant differences between individuals in exposure to disease information and its contribution to substantive adaptive action. Households reported several barriers to implement adaptation strategies including, lack of disease information, low efficacy of existing vaccine, distrust, religio-cultural sentiments, and livelihood concerns. We also found that informal information sharing presented a promising avenue from a health extension perspective albeit with trade-offs with potential distortion of the messages through misinformation and/or reporting bias. Altogether, our findings stress the importance of contextualising disease information and implementing interventions in a participatory way that sufficiently addresses the social determinants of health in order to bolster households' adaptive capacity to KFD and other neglected endemic zoonoses.",15,3,e0009265,,Business; Health care; Psychological intervention; Information sharing; Misinformation; Adaptive capacity; Disease; Livelihood; Socioeconomics; Social determinants of health,,"Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Susceptibility; Family Characteristics; Female; Humans; India/epidemiology; Information Services; Kyasanur Forest Disease/epidemiology; Male; Middle Aged; Rural Population; Vaccination; Young Adult; Zoonoses/epidemiology",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/ P024335/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/P024335/2) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33705400 https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0009265 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009265 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705400 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7987196,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009265,33705400,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009265,3134216655,PMC7987196,0,005-929-843-561-952; 007-103-545-356-223; 015-698-728-410-726; 024-977-810-297-089; 027-987-859-956-127; 028-001-713-928-96X; 029-235-866-317-156; 030-680-771-682-733; 030-832-523-186-255; 032-246-464-810-804; 033-480-358-944-456; 034-178-552-107-060; 037-550-015-414-716; 040-323-582-894-435; 042-137-689-019-175; 046-661-438-493-119; 047-942-747-477-515; 049-211-353-694-668; 050-193-438-793-648; 051-824-976-138-08X; 053-242-681-395-305; 055-527-807-389-800; 056-038-697-248-730; 058-363-131-150-007; 058-729-234-417-29X; 059-610-325-691-700; 061-141-933-332-675; 063-640-856-665-300; 065-305-437-038-147; 073-519-087-424-358; 077-328-451-851-633; 077-757-106-033-918; 084-516-067-842-056; 088-750-595-992-577; 091-502-695-118-970; 096-238-292-786-802; 102-042-299-785-352; 108-230-600-126-302; 108-611-901-680-55X; 113-618-719-171-735; 116-341-160-376-464; 120-508-791-678-027; 121-938-203-192-650; 125-393-088-525-402; 126-527-539-370-41X; 138-221-106-822-525; 142-265-709-337-974; 175-658-759-454-460,2

Analysis of significant policy documents reveals three interrelated discourses that are engaged within England's digital health policies: equity as a neoliberal imaginary of digital efficiency and empowerment; digital health as a pathway towards democratising health care through data-sharing, co-creation and collaboration; and finally, digital health as a route towards extending citizen autonomy through their access to data systems. It advances knowledge of the relationship between digital health policy and health inequalities. Revealing that while inclusion remains a priority area for policymakers, equity is being constituted in ways that reflect broader discourses of neoliberalism, empowerment and the turn to the market for technological solutionism, which may potentially exacerbate health inequalities.",41 Suppl 1,,31,,,E-health; Health Policy; Healthism; Internet; Social determinants of health; Youth,England; Health Policy; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Mobile Applications; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; State Medicine; Telemedicine/organization & administration; Wearable Electronic Devices,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (203254/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599987,31599987,,,PMC7586788,0,001-433-864-267-459; 019-763-543-864-098; 020-641-258-994-977; 022-047-610-747-360; 023-077-657-943-178; 025-398-236-151-05X; 030-836-098-696-307; 034-630-861-564-757; 035-584-654-929-874; 038-345-371-270-564; 039-739-096-357-304; 045-797-614-265-673; 060-270-237-650-607; 060-569-587-673-215; 070-219-720-458-294; 073-019-576-150-713; 084-887-787-636-106; 089-431-477-946-914; 095-629-361-162-465; 097-872-433-119-195; 101-077-676-033-257; 110-366-021-813-380; 114-953-023-107-799,5

To help bridge this gap and improve patient outcomes, the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research assembled a multistakeholder coalition to develop clinical recommendations for the optimal prevention of secondary fractureamong people aged 65 years and older with a hip or vertebral fracture. The coalition developed 13 recommendations (7 primary and 6 secondary) strongly supported by the empirical literature. The coalition recommends increased communication with patients regarding fracture risk, mortality and morbidity outcomes, and fracture risk reduction. Risk assessment (including fall history) should occur at regular intervals with referral to physical and/or occupational therapy as appropriate. Oral, intravenous, andsubcutaneous pharmacotherapies are efficaciousandcanreduce risk of future fracture.Patientsneededucation,however, about thebenefitsandrisks of both treatment and not receiving treatment. Oral bisphosphonates alendronate and risedronate are first-line options and are generally well tolerated; otherwise, intravenous zoledronic acid and subcutaneous denosumab can be considered. Anabolic agents are expensive butmay be beneficial for selected patients at high risk.Optimal duration of pharmacotherapy is unknown but because the risk for second fractures is highest in the earlypost-fractureperiod,prompt treatment is recommended.Adequate dietary or supplemental vitaminDand calciumintake shouldbe assured. Individuals beingtreatedfor osteoporosis shouldbe reevaluated for fracture risk routinely, includingvia patienteducationabout osteoporosisandfracturesandmonitoringfor adverse treatment effects.Patients shouldbestronglyencouraged to avoid tobacco, consume alcohol inmoderation atmost, and engage in regular exercise and fall prevention strategies. Finally, referral to endocrinologists or other osteoporosis specialists may be warranted for individuals who experience repeated fracture or bone loss and those with complicating comorbidities (eg, hyperparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease).",34,4,e125,e141,,,"Bone Density Conservation Agents/therapeutic use; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; Consensus; Diphosphonates; Humans; Osteoporosis/prevention & control; Osteoporotic Fractures/prevention & control",Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diphosphonates,Medical Research Council (MC_UP_A620_1015) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_U147585827) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12011/2) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_U147585819) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UP_A620_1014) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0400491) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_U147585824) United Kingdom; Department of Health (10/33/04) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12011/1) United Kingdom,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/bot.0000000000001743,32195892,10.1097/bot.0000000000001743,,,0,000-224-239-773-287; 000-756-164-610-658; 001-173-188-661-734; 001-305-676-699-434; 001-715-697-184-917; 002-071-407-984-912; 002-556-422-040-851; 003-192-650-037-605; 005-028-779-535-048; 005-449-657-692-884; 005-809-346-250-647; 006-601-392-977-138; 007-056-248-828-010; 008-131-800-674-179; 008-286-674-706-307; 008-875-580-359-24X; 009-645-264-156-056; 009-764-511-156-910; 009-985-134-734-082; 011-763-478-395-625; 011-965-594-897-572; 011-985-979-034-821; 011-990-632-586-658; 012-134-345-967-575; 012-381-822-064-01X; 012-642-274-091-57X; 013-269-058-314-840; 013-566-618-874-987; 013-971-956-792-334; 014-229-697-974-706; 014-558-913-417-320; 015-059-359-411-668; 015-500-782-996-266; 016-142-742-717-145; 016-795-652-519-688; 016-819-550-574-698; 017-244-228-757-383; 017-797-180-611-173; 018-015-946-872-375; 019-682-450-762-573; 019-916-282-084-011; 021-236-144-253-123; 021-945-184-467-347; 022-135-843-102-23X; 022-586-567-433-835; 023-718-358-505-845; 024-385-833-539-07X; 026-401-962-730-532; 026-913-735-880-564; 027-669-260-898-14X; 030-300-961-498-26X; 031-364-939-137-037; 031-922-898-853-849; 032-069-931-368-142; 032-114-261-590-114; 033-513-235-771-899; 033-832-993-770-834; 033-880-089-115-66X; 034-338-974-551-911; 036-210-624-116-75X; 036-494-252-677-990; 037-304-367-150-837; 037-693-079-479-234; 038-197-095-406-434; 038-737-868-985-728; 039-624-852-569-717; 040-430-452-183-698; 040-545-220-809-049; 040-715-687-691-637; 040-799-541-496-32X; 041-181-850-419-872; 045-132-588-911-777; 045-651-550-286-763; 046-315-533-757-459; 047-978-925-380-156; 048-660-702-816-107; 052-950-000-767-291; 053-653-964-797-730; 053-898-486-123-461; 055-612-483-386-06X; 056-051-668-649-566; 056-736-234-162-939; 058-595-299-830-201; 058-920-712-043-567; 063-289-120-862-250; 066-728-318-332-117; 067-563-309-911-073; 067-603-766-730-984; 068-900-728-370-700; 069-806-018-475-01X; 070-044-226-810-326; 074-523-049-803-857; 074-665-257-767-495; 076-508-811-803-582; 077-516-895-462-573; 077-572-530-094-225; 080-122-127-003-83X; 080-173-208-542-763; 081-202-165-011-01X; 081-707-134-716-491; 093-658-628-349-369; 094-483-508-402-115; 096-422-483-688-826; 096-765-326-677-511; 097-430-122-696-739; 098-262-064-675-900; 098-480-435-124-063; 100-062-806-641-114; 103-214-491-557-688; 103-961-783-907-626; 104-821-737-410-944; 137-083-068-183-398; 142-936-124-808-595; 144-414-260-827-234; 166-473-422-017-452; 167-382-453-007-815; 173-092-259-530-794; 184-220-986-787-070,6

Very little is known about what it is like to witness such a death.; Aim: To understand these families’ experience of their relative’s deaths.; Design: Qualitative study using in-depth narrative interviews analysed inductively with thematic analysis.; Participants: Twenty-one people (from 12 families) whose vegetative or minimally conscious relative died following court-authorised withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration. All had supported treatment-withdrawal.; Findings: Interviewees were usually anxious in advance about the nature of the death and had sometimes confronted resistance from, and been provided with misinformation by, healthcare staff in long-term care settings. However, they overwhelmingly described deaths as peaceful and sometimes even as a ‘good death’. There was (for some) a significant ‘burden of witness’ associated with the length of time it took the person to die and/or distressing changes in their appearance. Most continued to voice ethical objections to the manner of death while considering it ‘the least worst’ option in the circumstances.; Conclusions: Staff need to be aware of the distinctive issues around care for this patient group and their families. It’s important to challenge misinformation and initiate honest discussions about feeding-tube withdrawal and end-of-life care for these patients. Families (and staff) need better support in managing the ‘burden of witness’ associated with these deaths.",32,7,1180,1188,Psychiatry; Health care; Qualitative research; Witness; Misinformation; Feeding tube; Minimally conscious state; End-of-life care; Medicine; Thematic analysis,Artificial feeding; end-of-life care; minimally conscious state; qualitative research; tube feeding; vegetative state,Adult; Communication; Enteral Nutrition; Family/psychology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Persistent Vegetative State/mortality; Qualitative Research; Terminal Care/methods; Withholding Treatment; Young Adult,,Economic and Social Research Council,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29569993/ https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC6041738 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269216318766430 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269216318766430 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0269216318766430 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0269216318766430 https://core.ac.uk/display/151397750 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6041738 https://orca.cardiff.ac.uk/109788/ https://core.ac.uk/download/151397750.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0269216318766430,29569993,10.1177/0269216318766430,2792755498,PMC6041738,0,000-496-119-922-953; 001-021-165-110-654; 002-775-557-562-251; 012-028-083-455-481; 013-345-790-321-648; 014-888-451-720-502; 015-517-889-006-69X; 017-469-214-562-101; 017-941-253-900-990; 021-949-753-010-75X; 030-020-070-974-983; 035-054-277-522-236; 037-550-015-414-716; 041-662-337-892-80X; 050-350-118-924-369; 065-306-707-864-743; 087-753-239-040-980; 087-799-939-327-118; 091-562-654-271-594; 094-529-768-426-915; 097-399-923-063-955; 102-741-814-326-752; 111-149-844-297-466; 117-921-377-692-30X; 124-405-980-191-756; 136-685-088-502-415,12

Delegating tasks to so-called automated decision-making systems (ADMS) can improve efficiency and enable new solutions. However, these benefits are coupled with ethical challenges. For example, ADMS may produce discriminatory outcomes, violate individual privacy, and undermine human self-determination. New governance mechanisms are thus needed that help organisations design and deploy ADMS in ways that are ethical, while enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of automation. In this article, we consider the feasibility and efficacy of ethics-based auditing (EBA) as a governance mechanism that allows organisations to validate claims made about their ADMS. Building on previous work, we define EBA as a structured process whereby an entity's present or past behaviour is assessed for consistency with relevant principles or norms. We then offer three contributions to the existing literature. First, we provide a theoretical explanation of how EBA can contribute to good governance by promoting procedural regularity and transparency.

Both outward and inward foreign direct investment by multinationals were found to have strong potential implications for structural change, in the form of knowledge transfer and capabilities upgrading, productivity growth, export promotion, industrial diversification and service sector growth. With rapid development and diffusion of digital technologies, MNEs in the service sector and the digital economy may also open windows of opportunity for developing countries to catch-up in the service sector. The strength and sign of these effects were, however, dependent most prominently on (1) the characteristics of the MNEs and the host countries and (2) the compatibility of the MNEs and the host country. Policy and managerial implications are discussed. A set of areas for future research are also identified.",30,2,101801,,Business; Multinational corporation; Diversification (marketing strategy); Digital economy; Knowledge transfer; Foreign direct investment; Industrial organization; Tertiary sector of the economy; Promotion (rank); Developing country,,,,Economic and Social Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council; European Commission; European Commission,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969593121000081 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/iburev/v30y2021i2s0969593121000081.html https://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/id/eprint/44172/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101801,,10.1016/j.ibusrev.2021.101801,3118292748,,0,000-620-915-037-993; 000-785-409-672-287; 001-688-955-442-640; 002-590-165-684-013; 002-641-273-811-216; 002-802-343-915-948; 004-694-321-959-496; 005-556-224-866-58X; 006-256-429-603-398; 006-264-199-336-596; 006-278-275-429-91X; 006-576-266-922-281; 008-022-554-958-578; 008-627-189-801-602; 009-636-754-779-016; 010-203-713-470-196; 010-458-704-875-727; 010-512-476-558-803; 010-780-523-500-921; 011-219-659-274-102; 011-599-479-350-961; 014-581-006-733-288; 016-673-396-593-604; 016-836-041-190-383; 017-132-860-857-322; 018-031-842-215-944; 018-579-016-817-509; 018-837-482-736-350; 019-394-455-639-770; 022-450-030-150-998; 024-136-719-492-733; 024-701-921-003-429; 024-710-381-281-819; 026-862-338-215-74X; 027-061-944-866-59X; 028-662-589-048-604; 029-567-769-573-642; 030-845-760-915-530; 031-347-751-540-33X; 031-575-174-033-569; 032-322-822-669-348; 033-182-954-742-37X; 034-871-532-029-574; 035-358-700-523-010; 037-986-267-429-823; 038-147-629-238-936; 038-809-688-168-915; 040-763-715-391-575; 041-033-580-562-999; 043-084-252-125-83X; 044-405-046-956-203; 044-481-801-208-829; 044-939-487-527-988; 045-735-782-064-842; 047-332-369-428-776; 047-565-006-056-923; 048-398-630-456-665; 048-520-509-478-770; 048-735-886-156-564; 049-114-378-421-549; 051-061-142-362-437; 052-590-298-533-351; 052-885-085-415-720; 053-930-225-429-515; 054-046-502-446-014; 054-681-851-797-878; 054-844-955-114-326; 056-041-501-085-288; 057-661-567-462-780; 058-962-144-964-303; 060-599-929-342-342; 061-004-573-681-693; 061-141-394-037-983; 062-289-592-259-920; 062-491-537-687-956; 062-659-764-294-593; 062-792-906-138-565; 062-885-080-314-026; 063-018-176-380-619; 063-795-198-469-266; 064-181-881-702-595; 067-332-421-012-854; 068-259-085-977-283; 069-923-439-292-409; 070-182-119-652-671; 070-416-647-089-965; 070-992-399-490-367; 072-933-817-881-92X; 073-460-261-661-137; 073-761-539-331-239; 073-830-670-183-32X; 080-738-516-491-844; 082-238-563-173-672; 084-564-866-505-060; 084-760-094-178-933; 085-816-301-856-140; 087-902-446-328-975; 088-603-649-103-932; 089-543-624-413-031; 090-239-062-413-88X; 090-472-090-474-971; 092-894-444-629-209; 093-122-611-211-069; 093-320-894-237-302; 094-907-504-730-37X; 095-058-416-588-775; 095-884-194-218-967; 098-689-390-451-913; 098-754-214-602-346; 099-542-267-877-409; 099-671-859-806-373; 100-827-956-705-672; 102-457-690-630-366; 103-468-285-937-882; 104-176-017-032-923; 104-605-087-568-363; 108-025-045-630-258; 116-405-309-350-124; 116-654-908-220-310; 118-319-227-940-843; 119-916-657-846-859; 121-394-722-855-679; 122-183-443-385-535; 123-369-909-045-72X; 123-488-495-375-72X; 123-597-821-226-942; 123-706-432-097-470; 123-715-812-021-966; 124-147-500-727-242; 126-067-770-909-647; 130-986-676-987-720; 132-734-872-186-885; 133-474-072-838-409; 136-657-702-742-526; 138-523-115-967-658; 140-243-225-290-938; 142-948-157-925-323; 145-424-220-861-716; 147-491-915-347-61X; 151-707-554-133-257; 156-963-673-589-753; 157-847-653-175-316; 158-892-043-264-724; 159-354-441-747-48X; 161-311-162-358-926; 178-207-797-632-834; 182-907-355-948-999; 183-527-673-860-257; 187-399-268-885-890; 187-773-799-717-690; 191-674-909-683-753,5

Sydes; Dowling M; null Bryant; Biesty L,"Background: Data sharing enables researchers to conduct novel research with previously collected data sets, thus maximising scientific findings and cost effectiveness, and reducing research waste. The value of sharing anonymised data from clinical trials is well recognised with a moderated access approach recommended. While substantial challenges to data sharing remain, there are additional challenges for qualitative data. Qualitative data including videos, interviews, and observations are often more readily identifiable than quantitative data. Existing guidance from UK Economic and Social Research Council applies to sharing qualitative data but does not address the additional challenges related to sharing qualitative data collected within trials, including the need to incorporate the necessary information and consent into already complex recruitment processes, with the additional sensitive nature of health-related data. Methods: Work package 1 will involve separate focus group interviews with members of each stakeholder group: trial managers, clinical trialists, qualitative researchers, members of research funding bodies and trial participants who have been involved in qualitative research. Data will be analysed using thematic analysis and managed within QSR NVivo to enhance transparency. Work package 2 will involve a documentary analysis of current consent procedures for qualitative data collected as part of the conduct of clinical trials. We will include documents such as participant information leaflets and consent forms for the qualitative components in trials. We will extract data such as whether specific clauses for data sharing are included in the consent form. Content analysis will be used to analyse whether and how consent is being obtained for qualitative data sharing. Conclusions: This study will provide insight into the existing practice of sharing of qualitative data in clinical trials and the current issues and opportunities, to help shape future research and development of guidance to encourage maximum learning to be gained from this valuable data.",4,,47,47,Psychology; Production (economics); Data sharing; Protocol (science); Good practice; Medical education; Clinical trial; Focus group; Qualitative property; Psychology; Qualitative research; Data sharing; Protocol (science); Cost effectiveness; Social research; Knowledge management; Focus group; Thematic analysis; Qualitative property,data sharing; focus groups; qualitative; trials,,,Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12023/24) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8167499,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13269.2,34124575,10.12688/hrbopenres.13269.2,3169022142; 3162383626,PMC8167499,0,011-083-383-798-65X; 015-781-575-530-328; 016-365-837-816-953; 018-519-815-754-642; 021-862-840-020-92X; 034-072-577-337-983; 035-336-018-541-606; 037-550-015-414-716; 039-647-539-697-765; 040-507-703-988-152; 041-413-562-228-30X; 049-329-657-740-17X; 056-763-897-787-378; 064-510-884-507-052; 066-726-894-662-158; 069-833-799-773-725; 070-511-994-079-783; 072-833-282-579-805; 080-986-410-560-875; 084-193-486-911-681; 085-320-250-288-390; 116-862-714-776-413; 131-952-151-863-54X; 145-004-454-432-243,2

Arvanitis; D Badger; Nicholas D. James; R Mendelsohn; Omar Khan; Deepak Parashar; Prashant Patel,"Background: The potential of technology to aid integration of care delivery systems is being explored in a range of contexts across a variety of conditions in the United Kingdom. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in UK men. With a 10-year survival rate of 84%, there is a need to explore innovative methods of care that are integrated between primary health care providers and specialist teams in order to address long-term consequences of the disease and its treatment as well as to provide continued monitoring for recurrence. Objective: Our aim was to test the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to compare a model of prostate cancer continuing and follow-up care integration, underpinned by digital technology, with usual care in terms of clinical and cost-effectiveness, patient-reported outcomes, and experience. Methods: A first phase of the study has included development of an online adaptive prostate specific Holistic Needs Assessment system (HNA), training for primary care-based nurses, training of an IT peer supporter, and interviews with health care professionals and men with prostate cancer to explore views of their care, experience of technology, and views of the proposed intervention. In Phase 2, men in the intervention arm will complete the HNA at home to help identify and articulate concerns and share them with their health care professionals, in both primary and specialist care. Participants in the control arm will receive usual care. Outcomes including quality of life and well-being, prostate-specific concerns, and patient enablement will be measured 3 times over a 9-month period. Results: Findings from phase 1 indicated strong support for the intervention among men, including those who had had little experience of digital technology. Men expressed a range of views on ways that the online system might be used within a clinical pathway. Health care professionals gave valuable feedback on how the output of the assessment might be presented to encourage engagement and uptake by clinical teams. Recruitment to the second phase of the study, the feasibility trial, commenced March 2017. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first in the United Kingdom to trial an online holistic needs assessment for men with prostate cancer, with data shared between patients and primary and secondary care providers. This study addresses recommendations in recent policy documents promoting the importance of data sharing and enhanced communication between care providers as a basis for care integration. We anticipate that this model of care will ultimately provide important benefits for both patients and the National Health Service.

Coulson; Chris Griffiths,"Background: Superusers, defined as the 1% of users who write a large number of posts, play critical roles in online health communities (OHCs), catalyzing engagement and influencing other users’ self-care. Their unique online behavior is key to sustaining activity in OHCs and making them flourish. Our previous work showed the presence of 20 to 30 superusers active on a weekly basis among 3345 users in the nationwide Asthma UK OHC and that the community would disintegrate if superusers were removed. Recruiting these highly skilled individuals for research purposes can be challenging, and little is known about superusers.; Objective: This study aimed to explore superusers’ motivation to actively engage in OHCs, the difficulties they may face, and their interactions with health care professionals (HCPs).; Methods: An asynchronous web-based structured interview study was conducted. Superusers of the Asthma UK OHC and Facebook groups were recruited through Asthma UK staff to pilot and subsequently complete the questionnaire. Open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis.; Results: There were 17 superusers recruited for the study (14 patients with asthma and 3 carers); the majority were female (15/17). The age range of participants was 18 to 75 years. They were active in OHCs for 1 to 6 years and spent between 1 and 20 hours per week reading and 1 and 3 hours per week writing posts. Superusers’ participation in OHCs was prompted by curiosity about asthma and its medical treatment and by the availability of spare time when they were off work due to asthma exacerbations or retired. Their engagement increased over time as participants furthered their familiarity with the OHCs and their knowledge of asthma and its self-management. Financial or social recognition of the superuser role was not important; their reward came from helping and interacting with others. According to the replies provided, they showed careful judgment to distinguish what can be dealt with through peer advice and what needs input from HCPs. Difficulties were encountered when dealing with misunderstandings about asthma and its treatment, patients not seeking advice from HCPs when needed, and miracle cures or dangerous ideas. Out of 17 participants, only 3 stated that their HCPs were aware of their engagement with OHCs. All superusers thought that HCPs should direct patients to OHCs, provided they are trusted and moderated. In addition, 9 users felt that HCPs themselves should take part in OHCs.; Conclusions: Superusers from a UK-wide online community are highly motivated, altruistic, and mostly female individuals who exhibit judgment about the complexity of coping with asthma and the limits of their advice. Engagement with OHCs satisfies their psychosocial needs. Future research should explore how to address their unmet needs, their interactions with HCPs, and the potential integration of OHCs in traditional healthcare.",22,6,e18185,,Structured interview; Psychosocial; Psychology; eHealth; Self-management; Social support; Online community; Digital health; Online health communities; Medical education,asthma; eHealth; leadership; misinformation; online forums; online health communities; peer-to-peer support; self-management; social media; social networks; social support; superusers,Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asthma/therapy; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Public Health/methods; Telemedicine/methods; Young Adult,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Medical Research Council United Kingdom,https://doaj.org/article/48ffa023c084420ba6d43869865a6e8b https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32573463/ http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/18185 https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/65123 https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/18185 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7381072 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/superusers-engagement-in-asthma-online-communities-asynchronous-webbased-interview-study(6c26e6b2-dfcb-4003-a959-c81112fe594b).html https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC7381072/ https://www.jmir.org/2020/6/e18185/ https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/superusers-engagement-in-asthma-online-communities-asynchronous-w https://core.ac.uk/download/327124206.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2196/18185,32573463,10.2196/18185,3037187362,PMC7381072,0,001-134-820-716-232; 001-444-636-196-349; 003-187-152-209-279; 007-781-625-849-645; 010-684-837-726-384; 012-378-754-475-660; 017-822-210-053-54X; 018-392-307-150-230; 018-757-131-802-31X; 019-445-773-747-459; 021-862-840-020-92X; 024-255-863-164-840; 027-082-274-454-520; 027-546-892-532-04X; 028-015-749-931-72X; 028-689-046-999-331; 029-896-249-498-711; 030-187-319-829-47X; 031-607-088-245-913; 034-443-303-358-840; 034-806-683-956-358; 035-325-670-176-458; 037-217-445-861-170; 042-023-301-415-88X; 065-227-681-018-251; 082-376-235-005-376; 083-394-202-700-159; 083-885-999-479-346; 083-972-456-384-952; 091-694-112-936-699; 093-005-897-301-082; 122-937-002-011-253; 125-607-249-177-906; 141-673-900-879-997,4

Ashoor; Susan P.C. Le; Patricia Rios; Lesley A. Stewart; Mike Clarke; Dimitris Mavridis; Sharon E. Straus; Andrea C. Tricco,"Abstract Objectives The aim of the study was to examine the effect of providing a financial incentive to authors of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to obtain individual patient data (IPD). Study Design and Setting Parallel-group RCT with authors identified in the RCTs eligible for two systematic reviews. The authors were randomly allocated to the intervention (financial incentive with several contact approaches) or control group (using the same contact approaches). Studied outcomes are proportion of authors who provided IPD, time to obtain IPD, and completeness of IPD received. Results Of the 129 authors contacted, 37 authors suggested or contacted a person or funder providing relevant details or showed interest to collaborate, whereas 45 authors directed us to contact a person or funder, lacked resources or time, did not have ownership or approval to share the IPD, or claimed IPD was too old. None of the authors shared their IPD. We contacted 17 sponsors and received two complete IPD datasets from one sponsor. The time to obtain IPD was >1 year after a sponsor's positive response. Common barriers included study identification, data ownership, limited data access, and required IPD licenses. Conclusion IPD sharing may depend on study characteristics, including funding type, study size, study risk of bias, and treatment effect, but not on providing a financial incentive.",113,,176,188,Randomized controlled trial; Systematic review; Data sharing; Study Characteristics; Incentive; Treatment effect; Patient data; Family medicine; Medicine; Meta-analysis,Data retrieval; Data sharing; Incentive; Individual participant data; Meta-analysis; Patient-level data,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval/economics; Male; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/economics; Reimbursement, Incentive/standards",,Medical Research Council (G0901530) United Kingdom; CIHR Canada,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31153977 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435618310618 https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/147797/ https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/31153977 https://core.ac.uk/download/217701392.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2019.05.031,31153977,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2019.05.031,2947641233,,0,000-301-568-089-079; 001-636-848-048-600; 003-713-058-992-866; 004-927-101-042-867; 007-242-464-566-106; 008-747-365-741-431; 009-751-887-782-941; 010-662-237-700-765; 013-975-564-095-896; 017-830-647-917-101; 019-009-866-444-755; 021-925-215-428-423; 028-899-725-319-209; 033-030-194-998-440; 033-071-928-266-953; 035-906-153-525-395; 037-630-304-611-695; 037-641-828-542-890; 037-747-200-525-783; 038-304-296-609-423; 040-827-527-628-192; 041-428-397-828-388; 045-460-046-575-994; 048-382-477-690-730; 049-177-887-730-348; 050-260-636-209-964; 050-562-277-964-901; 054-212-966-623-833; 061-674-667-387-543; 062-524-439-483-616; 068-717-164-368-57X; 069-788-054-772-189; 082-219-138-800-838; 082-731-065-934-802; 086-767-538-523-916; 092-401-347-800-766; 104-794-221-909-372; 108-222-217-576-757; 113-465-946-474-168; 117-847-857-173-119; 124-895-553-714-473; 133-309-254-271-395; 156-380-368-221-544,13

However, a data management challenge presents itself with the new lifecycle view of data emphasized by the recent calls for data re-use, long term data preservation, and data sharing. There is currently a lack of dedicated infrastructure focused on the 'manageability' of the data lifecycle in TM research between data collection and analysis. Current community efforts towards establishing a culture for open science prompt the creation of a data custodianship environment for management of TM data assets to support data reuse and reproducibility of research results. Here we present the development of a lifecycle-based methodology to create a metadata management framework based on community driven standards for standardisation, consolidation and integration of TM research data.

Kanis,"The International Costs and Utilities Related to Osteoporotic fractures Study is a multinational observational study set up to describe the costs and quality of life (QoL) consequences of fragility fracture. This paper aims to estimate and compare QoL after hip, vertebral, and distal forearm fracture using time-trade-off (TTO), the EuroQol (EQ) Visual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS), and the EQ-5D-3L valued using the hypothetical UK value set. Data were collected at four time-points for five QoL point estimates: within 2 weeks after fracture (including pre-fracture recall), and at 4, 12, and 18 months after fracture. Health state utility values (HSUVs) were derived for each fracture type and time-point using the three approaches (TTO, EQ-VAS, EQ-5D-3L). HSUV were used to estimate accumulated QoL loss and QoL multipliers. In total, 1410 patients (505 with hip, 316 with vertebral, and 589 with distal forearm fracture) were eligible for analysis. Across all time-points for the three fracture types, TTO provided the highest HSUVs, whereas EQ-5D-3L consistently provided the lowest HSUVs directly after fracture. Except for 13–18 months after distal forearm fracture, EQ-5D-3L generated lower QoL multipliers than the other two methods, whereas no equally clear pattern was observed between EQ-VAS and TTO. On average, the most marked differences between the three approaches were observed immediately after the fracture. The approach to derive QoL markedly influences the estimated QoL impact of fracture. Therefore the choice of approach may be important for the outcome and interpretation of cost-effectiveness analysis of fracture prevention.",27,3,707,716,Quality of life; Visual analogue scale; Physical therapy; Observational study; Osteoporosis; Time-trade-off; EQ-5D; Fracture (geology); Medicine; Fragility,Fracture; Health utility; Health-related quality of life; Osteoporosis,"Aged; Female; Forearm/pathology; Fractures, Bone/economics; Health Status; Hip/pathology; Humans; Male; Pain Measurement/methods; Quality of Life/psychology; Spine/pathology; Surveys and Questionnaires",,Pfizer; Eli Lilly and Company; Medtronic; Novartis; Sanofi; Servier; Amgen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235059 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29235059/ https://acuresearchbank.acu.edu.au/item/8q3q3/quality-of-life-after-hip-vertebral-and-distal-forearm-fragility-fractures-measured-using-the-eq-5d-3l-eq-vas-and-time-trade-off-results-from-the-icuros https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-017-1748-5 https://researchbank.acu.edu.au/fhs_pub/8568/ https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/quality-of-life-after-hip-vertebral-and-distal-forearm-fragility- https://core.ac.uk/display/160046547 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11136-017-1748-5.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11136-017-1748-5,29235059,10.1007/s11136-017-1748-5,2775514536,,0,000-334-534-722-471; 000-931-749-925-423; 004-451-836-171-618; 004-611-534-176-034; 007-201-894-648-020; 011-147-007-763-664; 013-947-373-584-699; 022-758-583-767-26X; 028-662-407-844-184; 030-767-436-011-379; 033-448-161-878-07X; 035-536-955-757-803; 043-621-714-515-172; 045-617-590-955-168; 049-691-761-481-86X; 051-683-464-783-791; 058-956-007-056-826; 060-235-636-022-428; 060-861-500-668-762; 060-864-719-585-519; 062-797-425-814-465; 063-265-878-519-329; 066-969-194-363-700; 067-848-515-113-450; 067-916-945-261-906; 073-719-258-727-932; 074-253-028-322-539; 078-989-844-756-447; 079-536-532-231-523; 080-355-542-625-983; 082-651-266-685-320; 091-867-619-815-549; 094-993-059-621-864; 100-660-177-576-507; 105-348-030-834-714; 105-608-544-245-421; 105-901-310-775-457; 129-987-310-974-174; 130-573-951-789-089,19

Aaron; Christopher E. Brightling; Ian D. Pavord,"To the Editor: ; ; Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Current guidelines advocate the use of systemic corticosteroids in addition to antibiotics to treat an exacerbation [2, 3], but these treatments are not universally effective and are not without harm [4]. Individualised treatment may, therefore, be an advance. Recently we showed that patients with a peripheral blood eosinophil count of ≥2% at the onset of an outpatient managed exacerbation respond promptly and completely to prednisolone, whereas those with a count of <2% had a higher rate of treatment failure compared with placebo [5]. Whether these findings can be replicated in a larger population, including patients hospitalised with exacerbations of COPD remains unclear. We set out to address these questions in a further analysis of randomised controlled studies comparing outcomes in patients with exacerbations of COPD treated with prednisolone or non-prednisolone (placebo or equivalent). We investigated the rates of treatment failures in patients stratified by the peripheral blood eosinophil count measured at the time of exacerbation.; ; A literature search of the Medline, EMBASE and PubMed databases was performed using the MeSH terms: 1) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; 2) exacerbations; 3) oral corticosteroid/prednisolone; and 4) randomised clinical trials. Six trials fulfilled these criteria and the authors were contacted about data sharing. Of these studies, the peripheral blood eosinophil count at the onset …",44,3,789,791,Internal medicine; Intensive care medicine; Placebo; Prednisolone; COPD; Corticosteroid; Exacerbation; Population; Clinical trial; Medicine; Meta-analysis,,"Administration, Oral; Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage; Aged; Disease Progression; Eosinophils/cytology; Female; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Prednisolone/administration & dosage; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/blood; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Smoking; Treatment Outcome",Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Prednisolone,Medical Research Council (G0601369) United Kingdom; Department of Health (PDF-2013-06-052) United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24925917 http://erj.ersjournals.com/cgi/doi/10.1183/09031936.00062614 https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/44/3/789 http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/44/3/789.full.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24925917/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925917 https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/erj/44/3/789.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00062614,24925917,10.1183/09031936.00062614,1972175300,,0,023-221-804-382-379; 036-910-013-925-731; 041-474-900-666-505; 051-981-899-287-573; 072-691-951-313-270; 097-365-724-087-748; 136-323-969-018-780; 137-494-773-705-397,126

Lamond,"The proteome is a dynamic system in which each protein has interconnected properties - dimensions - that together contribute to the phenotype of a cell. Measuring these properties has proved challenging owing to their diversity and dynamic nature. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics now enable the measurement of multiple properties for thousands of proteins, including their abundance, isoform expression, turnover rate, subcellular localization, post-translational modifications and interactions. Complementing these experimental developments are new data analysis, integration and visualization tools as well as data-sharing resources. Together, these advances in the multidimensional analysis of the proteome are transforming our understanding of various cellular and physiological processes.",16,5,269,280,Proteome; Phenotype; Multidimensional analysis; Cytological Techniques; Protein processing; Post translational; Proteins metabolism; Proteomics; Biology; Cell biology,,"Animals; Cell Physiological Phenomena; Cytological Techniques; Databases, Protein; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Organ Specificity; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteins/analysis; Proteomics/methods",Proteins,Wellcome Trust (073980) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (097945) United Kingdom,https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm3970.pdf https://www.nature.com/articles/nrm3970 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/25857810 https://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v16/n5/fig_tab/nrm3970_ft.html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25857810/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25857810 https://core.ac.uk/download/30663380.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrm3970,25857810,10.1038/nrm3970,2055572452,,2,000-437-810-340-835; 000-705-580-209-636; 001-365-440-090-432; 001-817-804-460-321; 002-470-934-144-948; 002-490-428-025-522; 002-583-777-351-716; 002-681-670-998-316; 003-111-313-510-847; 003-499-269-728-294; 004-318-694-294-117; 004-582-007-870-358; 004-708-264-579-319; 005-534-975-897-590; 006-035-876-734-892; 006-867-434-456-92X; 006-980-523-575-087; 007-525-589-469-676; 007-585-958-259-151; 008-427-497-659-787; 008-507-591-964-454; 008-574-715-689-643; 009-693-521-047-560; 010-215-132-625-573; 010-479-769-176-049; 010-693-194-092-895; 011-085-779-195-045; 011-216-010-165-661; 011-828-930-313-070; 012-132-759-329-961; 012-828-944-288-159; 012-898-126-036-965; 013-807-646-465-923; 014-158-786-575-859; 014-253-456-455-251; 014-616-670-453-687; 014-793-338-069-744; 015-380-558-565-265; 016-089-225-554-202; 016-091-083-150-028; 016-311-654-060-23X; 017-287-116-147-900; 017-676-264-885-517; 018-164-762-542-960; 019-337-473-454-349; 019-459-729-260-376; 019-733-797-097-40X; 020-788-974-686-728; 021-313-472-655-283; 021-741-579-623-469; 022-412-745-126-599; 023-728-660-753-435; 023-970-065-565-523; 024-134-144-809-154; 024-490-488-967-640; 025-770-415-977-285; 026-248-640-780-491; 026-872-501-448-789; 028-327-578-286-609; 028-509-117-074-328; 028-641-960-945-287; 029-104-685-896-988; 029-147-356-671-841; 030-660-012-339-274; 032-036-790-393-115; 032-722-948-920-73X; 032-743-250-069-632; 034-140-128-438-326; 034-189-917-031-526; 036-786-540-476-549; 039-498-453-246-748; 039-882-713-153-369; 041-851-145-365-290; 042-354-265-961-248; 042-972-033-522-455; 043-291-299-180-221; 043-595-919-054-078; 044-561-444-355-854; 045-186-678-293-873; 049-543-598-185-512; 049-964-251-899-220; 050-158-311-352-454; 052-026-357-553-073; 052-115-588-314-947; 052-378-596-292-607; 052-701-515-858-339; 055-631-309-011-717; 057-284-780-214-232; 057-350-495-594-603; 059-019-944-503-387; 061-035-663-930-034; 061-243-539-833-954; 061-666-139-394-213; 062-407-498-916-335; 063-648-232-961-220; 066-660-648-397-126; 066-753-162-774-30X; 069-333-560-323-633; 069-487-843-561-705; 073-796-661-727-114; 074-008-050-647-277; 074-130-301-137-001; 074-273-534-252-025; 077-193-606-955-782; 078-434-938-566-629; 079-676-877-896-867; 080-129-698-565-416; 081-033-321-935-819; 081-761-076-626-89X; 083-273-981-455-971; 083-741-123-493-52X; 084-261-512-321-303; 084-554-595-732-077; 084-918-234-811-647; 086-025-791-175-780; 086-883-171-538-588; 087-744-293-240-882; 088-136-872-367-906; 089-460-017-478-729; 089-481-084-303-673; 090-813-813-741-598; 092-819-562-440-749; 092-837-621-620-790; 093-246-481-063-591; 095-016-944-679-35X; 095-835-818-004-772; 099-696-386-660-116; 101-565-560-470-474; 102-116-676-600-763; 102-793-638-375-25X; 103-403-234-943-863; 104-791-434-360-834; 107-007-514-420-865; 108-298-116-795-433; 108-800-819-033-671; 109-455-680-285-111; 110-721-919-704-299; 116-451-505-391-836; 118-499-151-062-482; 120-092-289-181-465; 122-481-080-454-356; 122-656-678-890-138; 130-454-961-727-066; 131-305-977-911-527; 137-787-715-040-373; 138-195-415-185-869; 138-682-760-204-539; 139-865-015-807-557; 142-031-797-364-371; 148-070-619-193-485; 150-325-162-873-23X; 151-462-693-114-088; 176-356-553-671-147,294

The talks at the conference focused on two main topic areas: (1) Technologies and Applications, with emphasis on personal genomics in the context of healthcare. The issues discussed ranged from new technologies impacting and enabling the field, to the interpretation of personal genomes and their integration with other data types. There was particular emphasis and wide discussion on the use of polygenic risk scores to inform precision medicine. (2) Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications, with emphasis on genetic privacy: How to maintain it, how much privacy is possible, and how much privacy do people want? Talks covered the full range of genomic data visibility, from open access to tight control, and diverse aspects of balancing benefits and risks, data ownership, working with individuals and with populations, and promoting citizen science. Both topic areas were illustrated and informed by reports from a wide variety of ongoing projects, which highlighted the need to diversify global databases by increasing representation of understudied populations.",10,9,643,,Internet privacy; Variety (cybernetics); Sociology; Precision medicine; Citizen science; Emerging technologies; Personal genomics; Data sharing; Context (language use); Openness to experience,algorithms; data sharing; genome sequencing; medical applications; privacy,"Genetic Privacy/ethics; Genome, Human; Humans; Information Dissemination",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6700740 https://digitalcommons.psjhealth.org/publications/2046/ https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/9/643/pdf http://europepmc.org/article/MED/31450660 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6770764 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/10/9/643 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31450660/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes10090643,31450660,10.3390/genes10090643,2969237350,PMC6770764,0,008-994-919-185-376; 011-943-503-046-346; 022-483-704-759-427; 040-986-490-490-625; 070-123-774-392-669; 073-693-472-209-439; 087-852-155-061-067; 089-273-670-266-864; 119-779-524-499-453; 120-131-933-505-029; 120-357-609-303-70X; 123-510-343-483-850,3

Sharing their health data with their peers may support self-management, but the trust, identity, privacy and security (TIPS) considerations of people living with HIV remain underexplored. Working with a peer researcher who is expert in the lived experience of HIV, we interviewed 26 people living with HIV in the United Kingdom (UK) to investigate how to design a peer data sharing platform. We also conducted rating activities with participants to capture their attitudes towards sharing personal data. Our mixed methods study showed that participants were highly sophisticated in their understanding of trust and in their requirements for robust privacy and security. They indicated willingness to share digital identity attributes, including gender, age, medical history, health and well-being data, but not details that could reveal their personal identity. Participants called for TIPS measures to foster and to sustain responsible data sharing within their community. These findings can inform the development of trustworthy and secure digital platforms that enable people living with HIV to share data with their peers and provide insights for researchers who wish to facilitate data sharing in other communities with stigmatised health conditions.",4,CSCW2,1,27,Internet privacy; Psychology; Identity (social science); Digital identity; Data sharing; Identity privacy; Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); Health data; Lived experience; Personal identity,,,,EPSRC,https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/24730/ https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/271610 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/pacmhci/pacmhci4.html#BussoneKSDTGLB20 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/pacmhci/pacmhci4.html#BussoneKSDTGLB20 https://doi.org/10.1145/3415244 https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3415244 https://core.ac.uk/download/333901142.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3415244,,10.1145/3415244,3049635907,,0,001-971-367-689-480; 004-694-802-760-816; 005-362-205-395-30X; 009-141-608-985-191; 010-018-822-129-611; 010-189-613-022-048; 010-676-119-512-146; 011-682-848-129-072; 011-826-008-167-383; 012-875-251-689-293; 012-934-583-783-160; 016-344-626-426-960; 017-044-779-788-737; 017-647-184-657-423; 018-186-606-713-278; 019-887-895-081-550; 020-402-347-379-847; 020-646-209-653-204; 021-681-337-626-737; 030-849-293-459-828; 035-083-635-487-438; 036-742-464-223-712; 037-550-015-414-716; 042-778-872-883-471; 044-047-092-800-499; 045-735-904-481-741; 048-018-355-594-678; 049-981-862-708-950; 055-168-443-149-651; 060-375-772-573-528; 066-366-703-725-739; 066-418-495-279-034; 067-803-030-805-10X; 076-140-751-075-962; 079-423-910-271-928; 091-939-779-411-332; 093-439-513-286-652; 096-654-335-866-881; 096-897-144-361-529; 097-471-516-417-262; 105-111-337-984-922; 117-183-214-256-165; 121-916-276-581-123; 123-134-607-846-859; 130-754-013-993-510; 146-393-278-994-623; 153-374-589-802-692; 157-823-190-354-513; 169-708-129-064-068; 182-680-219-160-28X,2

Whitley; David Lund; Jane Kaye; William G Dixon,"Background: Electronic health records are widely acknowledged to provide an important opportunity to anonymize patient-level health care data and collate across populations to support research. Nonetheless, in the wake of public and policy concerns about security and inappropriate use of data, conventional approaches toward data governance may no longer be sufficient to respect and protect individual privacy. One proposed solution to improve transparency and public trust is known as Dynamic Consent, which uses information technology to facilitate a more explicit and accessible opportunity to opt out. In this case, patients can tailor preferences about whom they share their data with and can change their preferences reliably at any time. Furthermore, electronic systems provide opportunities for informing patients about data recipients and the results of research to which their data have contributed. Objective: To explore patient perspectives on the use of anonymized health care data for research purposes. To evaluate patient perceptions of a Dynamic Consent model and electronic system to enable and implement ongoing communication and collaboration between patients and researchers. Methods: A total of 26 qualitative interviews and three focus groups were conducted that included a video presentation explaining the reuse of anonymized electronic patient records for research. Slides and tablet devices were used to introduce the Dynamic Consent system for discussion. A total of 35 patients with chronic rheumatic disease with varying levels of illness and social deprivation were recruited from a rheumatology outpatient clinic; 5 participants were recruited from a patient and public involvement health research network. Results: Patients were supportive of sharing their anonymized electronic patient record for research, but noted a lack of transparency and awareness around the use of data, making it difficult to secure public trust. While there were general concerns about detrimental consequences of data falling into the wrong hands, such as insurance companies, 39 out of 40 (98%) participants generally considered that the altruistic benefits of sharing health care data outweighed the risks. Views were mostly positive about the use of an electronic interface to enable greater control over consent choices, although some patients were happy to share their data without further engagement. Participants were particularly enthusiastic about the system as a means of enabling feedback regarding data recipients and associated research results, noting that this would improve trust and public engagement in research. This underlines the importance of patient and public involvement and engagement throughout the research process, including the reuse of anonymized health care data for research. More than half of patients found the touch screen interface easy to use, although a significant minority, especially those with limited access to technology, expressed some trepidation and felt they may need support to use the system. Conclusions: Patients from a range of socioeconomic backgrounds viewed a digital system for Dynamic Consent positively, in particular, feedback about data recipients and research results. Implementation of a digital Dynamic Consent system would require careful interface design and would need to be located within a robust data infrastructure; it has the potential to improve trust and engagement in electronic medical record research.

Harris; Alvaro Lorenzo-Lopez; Owain Jones; Justin J. H. Buck; Alexandra Kokkinaki; Stephen Loch; Thomas Gardner; Alexander B. Phillips,"Long-range Marine Autonomous Systems (MAS), operating beyond the visual line-of-sight of a human pilot or research ship, are creating unprecedented opportunities for oceanographic data collection. Able to operate for up to months at a time, periodically communicating with a remote pilot via satellite, long-range MAS vehicles significantly reduce the need for an expensive research ship presence within the operating area. Heterogeneous fleets of MAS vehicles, operating simultaneously in an area for an extended period of time, are becoming increasingly popular due to their ability to provide an improved composite picture of the marine environment. However at present, the expansion of the size and complexity of these multi-vehicle operations is limited by a number of factors: (1) custom control-interfaces require pilots to be trained in the use of each individual vehicle, with limited cross-platform standardisation; (2) the data produced by each vehicle are typically in a custom vehicle-specific format, making the automated ingestion of observational data for near-real-time analysis and assimilation into operational ocean models very difficult; (3) the majority of MAS vehicles do not provide machine-to-machine interfaces, limiting the development and usage of common piloting tools, multi-vehicle operating strategies, autonomous control algorithms and automated data delivery. In this paper, we describe a novel piloting and data management system (C2) which provides a unified web-based infrastructure for the operation of long-range MAS vehicles within the UK's National Marine Equipment Pool. The system automates the archiving, standardisation and delivery of near-real-time science data and associated metadata from the vehicles to end-users and Global Data Assembly Centres mid-mission. Through the use and promotion of standard data formats and machine interfaces throughout the C2 system, we seek to enable future opportunities to collaborate with both the marine science and robotics communities to maximise the delivery of high-quality oceanographic data for world-leading science.",7,,397,,Data collection; Human–robot interaction; Artificial intelligence; Data management; Systems engineering; Control (management); Robotics; Computer science; Promotion (rank); Data curation; Metadata,,,,Natural Environment Research Council,https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=202002254217418129 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00397/full https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2020.00397/full https://core.ac.uk/download/328734835.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2020.00397,,10.3389/fmars.2020.00397,3035562374,,0,001-166-173-130-644; 002-048-565-226-046; 004-748-065-072-052; 005-411-638-534-115; 006-417-643-940-621; 010-845-754-674-448; 011-883-722-192-86X; 012-706-870-675-184; 014-054-466-481-072; 015-825-629-523-206; 019-148-542-273-769; 021-275-998-337-306; 022-526-129-975-007; 024-182-893-259-213; 026-542-828-292-729; 031-692-857-840-135; 038-455-539-624-168; 038-694-136-599-373; 040-465-436-074-408; 043-168-196-065-796; 044-697-866-162-975; 049-737-065-147-092; 050-344-696-074-983; 052-122-208-938-180; 054-011-091-474-386; 057-650-776-257-309; 065-992-734-709-389; 068-680-839-850-81X; 070-462-022-251-464; 071-971-042-465-541; 084-682-912-696-337; 092-862-445-466-265; 094-851-141-149-331; 110-105-639-013-136; 113-796-517-439-555; 123-409-468-529-422; 125-020-537-094-811; 127-485-404-772-466; 132-487-432-859-067; 180-210-211-637-865; 192-313-918-027-662,6

Igumbor; Uthman A. Olalekan; Tobias Chirwa; Sam M. Kinyanjui; Catherine Kyobutungi; Sharon Fonn,"Background: The rising digitisation and proliferation of data sources and repositories cannot be ignored. This trend expands opportunities to integrate and share population health data. Such platforms have many benefits, including the potential to efficiently translate information arising from such data to evidence needed to address complex global health challenges. There are pockets of quality data on the continent that may benefit from greater integration. Integration of data sources is however under-explored in Africa. The aim of this article is to identify the requirements and provide practical recommendations for developing a multi-consortia public and population health data-sharing framework for Africa. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of global best practices and policies on data sharing and its optimisation. We searched eight databases for publications and undertook an iterative snowballing search of articles cited in the identified publications. The Leximancer software © enabled content analysis and selection of a sample of the most relevant articles for detailed review. Themes were developed through immersion in the extracts of selected articles using inductive thematic analysis. We also performed interviews with public and population health stakeholders in Africa to gather their experiences, perceptions, and expectations of data sharing. Results: Our findings described global stakeholder experiences on research data sharing. We identified some challenges and measures to harness available resources and incentivise data sharing.  We further highlight progress made by the different groups in Africa and identified the infrastructural requirements and considerations when implementing data sharing platforms. Furthermore, the review suggests key reforms required, particularly in the areas of consenting, privacy protection, data ownership, governance, and data access. Conclusions: The findings underscore the critical role of inclusion, social justice, public good, data security, accountability, legislation, reciprocity, and mutual respect in developing a responsive, ethical, durable, and integrated research data sharing ecosystem.",6,,214,,Data security;

However, as data volumes increase, expensive big data infrastructures are called to rescue. In this setting, analytics tasks become very costly in terms of query response time, resource consumption, and money in cloud deployments, especially when base data are stored across geographically distributed data centers. Therefore, we introduce an adaptive, reciprocity-based Machine Learning mechanism which is light-weight, stored client-side, can estimate the answers of a variety of aggregate queries and can avoid the big data back-end. The estimations are performed in milliseconds are inexpensive and accurate as the mechanism learns from past analytical-query patterns. However, as analytic queries are ad hoc and analysts’ interests change over time we develop solutions that can swiftly and accurately detect such changes and adapt to new query patterns. The capabilities of our approach are demonstrated using extensive evaluation with real and synthetic datasets.",109,,317,330,Distributed computing; Adaptive learning; Reciprocity (network science); Computer science; Big data; Analytics; Cloud computing,,,,the European Union EU/H2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action Individual Fellowship; UK EPSRC,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1908.html#abs-1908-04772 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/138133/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19329504 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/213194/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X19329504,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2020.03.063,,10.1016/j.future.2020.03.063,3015810322,,0,002-814-155-069-236; 006-299-463-890-28X; 008-293-589-223-488; 011-274-075-548-175; 011-554-297-975-195; 011-608-968-008-341; 012-733-071-341-288; 013-043-724-139-430; 017-409-382-386-691; 022-121-234-111-889; 027-678-378-468-799; 029-396-667-795-398; 032-376-582-653-630; 040-474-655-313-696; 043-681-125-048-881; 044-518-572-756-026; 046-113-126-944-075; 071-492-814-396-622; 072-451-518-503-003; 076-906-314-037-737; 079-903-683-369-767; 088-203-789-087-716; 093-322-014-375-686; 094-743-612-029-451; 095-628-430-526-046; 117-521-245-986-880; 125-031-725-879-636; 134-909-827-411-080; 135-919-643-142-23X; 157-337-904-457-335; 159-744-652-560-184; 199-149-445-734-22X,3

Amid increasing calls for more effective sharing of individual-level data, commitment to promote access to research data is evident within South Africa’s public research sector, but national guidance and regulation are absent. This qualitative study examined the perceptions, experiences and concerns of 32 research stakeholders about data-sharing practices. There was consensus about the utility of data sharing in publicly funded health research. However, disparate views emerged about the possible harms and benefits of sharing data and how these should be weighed.

This study aimed to survey GPs and PMs for familiarity, engagement with and perceptions of patient data sharing. Methods Cross-sectional survey. All 107 general practices in England’s second largest Clinical Commissioning Group, Cambridgeshire & Peterborough CCG. Descriptive statistics; hierarchical logistic regression; thematic analysis. Results 405 (64%) responses were received – from 338 (62%) GPs and 67 (71%) PMs. Familiarity and engagement were highest for local frail elderly and end of life care projects (>76% had used). The greatest difference in use concerned the now suspended national care.data initiative: PMs had odds of reporting use 75 times higher than GP partners (95% CI 27–211). Patient confusion was the most pronounced challenge and improved coordination the most pronounced expected benefit. Frequency of discussions with patients varied with IT competence (OR 4.2 for most competent users relative to least, 95% CI 1.7–10.7) and clinical system (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.5). Patient reservations were reported more frequently by respondents who rated their IT competence as highest (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5–7.6), perceived more data sharing challenges (OR for a 1-point increase in challenges perception score 3.4, 95% CI 2.1–5.6) and by PMs (relative to GP partners, OR 18.0, 95% CI 7.9–41.3). Conclusions Familiarity with and use of data sharing projects was high among GPs and PMs. Both their individual and organisational characteristics were associated with the reported frequency of discussions and patients’ responses. Improved awareness of the impact of provider characteristics and attitudes on patients’ decisions about data sharing may enhance the equity and autonomy of those decisions.",104,,74,83,Cross-sectional study; Odds; Project commissioning; Health information exchange; Data sharing; End-of-life care; Descriptive statistics; Family medicine; Medicine; Thematic analysis,Attitudes; Case management [MeSH]; Electronic health records [MeSH]; General pracitce [MeSH]; Health information exchange [MeSH]; Health knowledge; Practice [MeSH],Aged; Case Managers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery of Health Care/standards; England; Female; Frail Elderly; General Practitioners; Humans; Information Dissemination; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Care Team; Patient-Centered Care/standards; Surveys and Questionnaires,,Department of Health United Kingdom,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505617301478 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/266308 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28599819 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.05.009 https://core.ac.uk/display/96706690 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28599819 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505617301478 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/96706690.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.05.009,28599819,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2017.05.009,2614999076,,0,000-109-973-285-225; 000-459-942-846-608; 001-513-730-206-327; 003-131-515-417-323; 005-857-131-061-36X; 008-349-516-204-34X; 010-472-816-896-152; 010-955-233-454-631; 011-203-180-779-962; 012-355-389-568-620; 014-843-361-335-265; 016-737-559-082-56X; 018-214-911-483-275; 019-721-100-273-04X; 021-127-480-797-610; 029-426-017-664-956; 029-728-878-325-378; 030-698-576-428-110; 035-303-971-245-552; 036-615-704-065-089; 036-973-960-452-790; 037-197-823-992-819; 037-382-372-255-40X; 040-056-642-999-594; 047-518-769-513-035; 051-457-189-898-643; 053-659-957-455-991; 055-595-509-467-182; 057-140-553-399-940; 066-268-729-875-074; 070-520-827-565-981; 078-103-389-103-173; 080-685-496-340-531; 086-517-210-819-957; 087-642-257-340-563; 092-589-851-806-523; 097-246-212-962-287; 102-423-655-357-506; 109-184-059-733-252; 120-682-726-119-02X; 129-873-988-214-712; 129-952-940-001-860; 154-639-085-605-545; 156-725-367-002-682; 171-715-490-181-529,5

Morris; Katelyn M. Gostic; Simone Pompei; Trevor Bedford; Marta Łuksza; Richard A. Neher; Bryan T. Grenfell; Michael Lässig; John W. McCauley,"Seasonal influenza is controlled through vaccination campaigns. Evolution of influenza virus antigens means that vaccines must be updated to match novel strains, and vaccine effectiveness depends on the ability of scientists to predict nearly a year in advance which influenza variants will dominate in upcoming seasons. In this review, we highlight a promising new surveillance tool: predictive models. Based on data-sharing and close collaboration between the World Health Organization and academic scientists, these models use surveillance data to make quantitative predictions regarding influenza evolution. Predictive models demonstrate the potential of applied evolutionary biology to improve public health and disease control. We review the state of influenza predictive modeling and discuss next steps and recommendations to ensure that these models deliver upon their considerable biomedical promise.",26,2,102,118,Public health; Evolution of influenza; Vaccination; Vaccination Campaigns; Disease control; World health; Seasonal influenza; Surveillance data; Evolutionary biology; Biology,Influenza; Predictive evolution; predictive modeling; vaccine strain selection,"Antigens, Viral/genetics; Biological Evolution; Decision Support Techniques; Disease Outbreaks; Forecasting; Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests/methods; Humans; Influenza Vaccines/immunology; Influenza, Human/epidemiology; Orthomyxoviridae/genetics; Public Health; Seasons; Vaccination; World Health Organization","Antigens, Viral; Influenza Vaccines",NIGMS NIH HHS (R35 GM119774) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (P2C HD047879) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (R01 AI127893) United States; NCI NIH HHS (P01 CA087497) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (F31 AI134017) United States; Medical Research Council (MC_U117512723) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Cancer Research UK (FC001030) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (FC001030) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (FC001030) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5830126 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X17302093 https://collaborate.princeton.edu/en/publications/predictive-modeling-of-influenza-shows-the-promise-of-applied-evo https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6324320 https://www.scilit.net/article/0c259c8f2638a975313164af9ea78883 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20183082361?q=(similar%3a20103109992) https://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/fulltext/S0966-842X(17)30209-3 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/29097090 http://www.cell.com/article/S0966842X17302093/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2017.09.004,29097090,10.1016/j.tim.2017.09.004,2765600556,PMC5830126,0,001-114-963-758-618; 001-565-267-853-999; 002-078-873-394-831; 002-205-081-782-755; 004-265-428-543-647; 004-701-625-088-792; 005-258-223-931-321; 005-896-668-527-66X; 006-801-168-149-262; 007-953-544-359-378; 008-619-103-971-468; 008-684-776-380-823; 008-862-211-457-271; 009-651-383-624-669; 010-147-619-678-43X; 010-468-220-408-283; 010-628-364-831-021; 011-326-055-288-97X; 012-800-998-569-509; 012-878-743-521-730; 013-038-296-490-286; 013-128-430-742-763; 013-540-575-583-083; 013-577-362-370-315; 013-720-600-399-99X; 014-711-579-648-200; 016-074-446-362-43X; 016-394-803-418-458; 016-823-962-060-513; 017-591-439-495-893; 017-891-307-145-706; 017-916-125-248-569; 020-820-009-516-484; 022-831-483-145-605; 023-538-192-538-402; 024-680-191-359-000; 026-102-558-965-348; 026-275-181-936-98X; 026-326-616-519-26X; 027-070-767-816-229; 027-183-275-585-306; 028-791-809-635-618; 028-794-050-010-076; 028-899-895-169-549; 031-038-707-828-142; 031-149-831-194-548; 031-349-513-709-493; 032-315-221-732-908; 032-371-291-965-420; 032-405-279-082-134; 032-829-622-517-086; 033-141-527-820-854; 033-546-798-540-681; 033-715-911-616-436; 033-890-266-929-680; 035-607-725-690-303; 035-852-219-372-942; 036-188-645-438-645; 036-418-145-991-058; 039-887-714-349-497; 040-098-195-011-059; 040-246-495-117-594; 040-771-264-721-909; 041-378-415-814-957; 044-160-053-686-667; 044-654-462-814-80X; 044-788-219-666-417; 046-772-022-838-250; 047-056-721-211-704; 047-107-063-301-210; 050-377-160-096-915; 050-969-550-613-542; 051-717-879-841-212; 051-737-785-844-699; 051-805-179-944-878; 052-155-918-304-01X; 052-458-135-248-582; 052-771-037-290-315; 053-160-360-962-963; 053-272-038-879-914; 055-631-404-470-006; 056-007-993-724-082; 056-696-407-255-604; 057-206-434-149-251; 057-503-184-072-87X; 058-032-230-312-546; 059-805-589-404-875; 061-052-495-927-868; 062-888-239-956-172; 064-333-769-525-074; 065-297-922-921-809; 065-589-126-968-483; 066-002-159-689-107; 070-874-375-153-780; 071-374-412-018-656; 074-128-532-196-655; 077-325-096-326-24X; 078-435-662-748-660; 078-642-674-247-654; 081-946-400-513-071; 086-198-915-877-57X; 088-110-954-331-186; 091-892-160-443-415; 096-023-013-894-256; 097-277-787-189-434; 097-317-024-436-445; 109-803-800-771-690; 115-423-046-293-983; 120-150-322-213-901; 125-658-771-071-768; 127-940-559-233-354; 131-651-788-289-54X; 183-839-942-877-122,61

Harrison; Jun Fan; David J. Richardson; Laura Clarke; Daniel R. Zerbino; Guy Cochrane; Alan Archibald; C. J. Schmidt; Paul Flicek,"The Functional Annotation of ANimal Genomes (FAANG) project aims, through a coordinated international effort, to provide high quality functional annotation of animal genomes with an initial focus on farmed and companion animals. A key goal of the initiative is to ensure high quality and rich supporting metadata to describe the project's animals, specimens, cell cultures and experimental assays. By defining rich sample and experimental metadata standards and promoting best practices in data descriptions, deposition and openness, FAANG champions higher quality and reusability of published datasets. FAANG has established a Data Coordination Centre, which sits at the heart of the Metadata and Data Sharing Committee. It continues to evolve the metadata standards, support submissions and, crucially, create powerful and accessible tools to support deposition and validation of metadata. FAANG conforms to the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principles, with high quality, open access and functionally interlinked data. In addition to data generated by FAANG members and specific FAANG projects, existing datasets that meet the main-or more permissive legacy-standards are incorporated into a central, focused, functional data resource portal for the entire farmed and companion animal community. Through clear and effective metadata standards, validation and conversion software, combined with promotion of best practices in metadata implementation, FAANG aims to maximise effectiveness and inter-comparability of assay data. This supports the community to create a rich genome-to-phenotype resource and promotes continuing improvements in animal data standards as a whole.",49,6,520,526,Best practice; Interoperability; Data science; Quality (business); Community standards; Data sharing; Animal data; Resource (project management); Biology; Metadata, functional annotation; FAIR principles; community standards; farmed animals; genome to phenome; livestock; metadata validation,Animals; Data Curation/standards; Genomics; Livestock; Metadata/standards; Pets; Software,,Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/N019202/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/N019563/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBS/E/D/10002070) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBS/E/D/20211550) United Kingdom,https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/faang-establishing-metadata-standards-validation-and-best-practic https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/30311252 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/age.12736 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6334167 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6334167 https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/76190227/Harrison_et_al_2018_Animal_Genetics.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/195268539.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/age.12736,30311252,10.1111/age.12736,2897745988,PMC6334167,0,002-281-286-536-560; 015-076-737-023-262; 022-526-129-975-007; 024-645-901-447-985; 037-593-759-042-812; 046-959-978-109-642; 057-213-264-299-462; 059-298-017-288-553; 070-462-022-251-464; 071-111-202-466-034; 079-670-225-859-035; 080-546-661-913-824; 100-840-528-972-746; 121-311-380-693-131,20

The aim of this consensus statement is, therefore, to enhance understanding, counter misinformation, and steer family-court utilisation of attachment theory in a supportive, evidence-based direction, especially with regard to child protection and child custody decision-making. The article is divided into two parts. In the first, we address problems related to the use of attachment theory and research in family courts, and discuss reasons for these problems. To this end, we examine family court applications of attachment theory in the current context of the best-interest-of-the-child standard, discuss misunderstandings regarding attachment theory, and identify factors that have hindered accurate implementation. In the second part, we provide recommendations for the application of attachment theory and research. To this end, we set out three attachment principles: the child’s need for familiar, non-abusive caregivers; the value of continuity of good-enough care; and the benefits of networks of attachment relationships. We also discuss the suitability of assessments of attachment quality and caregiving behaviour to inform family court decision-making. We conclude that assessments of caregiver behaviour should take center stage. Although there is dissensus among us regarding the use of assessments of attachment quality to inform child custody and child-protection decisions, such assessments are currently most suitable for targeting and directing supportive interventions. Finally, we provide directions to guide future interdisciplinary research collaboration.",24,1,1,52,Attachment theory; Psychology; Set (psychology); Social work; Value (ethics); Misinformation; Child protection;

Tangwa,"<ns3:p>During public health emergencies (PHEs), data are collected and generated from a variety of activities and sources, including but not limited to national public health programs, research and community-based activities. It is critical that these data are rapidly shared in order to facilitate the public health response, epidemic preparedness, as well as research during and after the epidemic. Nonetheless, collecting and sharing data during PHEs can be challenging, especially where there are limited resources for public health and research-related activities. In a symposium that brought together different stakeholders that were involved in the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreaks in West Africa, meeting attendees shared their perspectives on the values and management of data during PHEs in sub-Saharan Africa. Key factors that could inform and facilitate data management during PHEs in sub-Saharan Africa were discussed, including using data to inform policy decisions and healthcare; a coordinated data collection and management scheme; identifying incentives for data sharing; and equitable data  governance mechanism that emphasise principles of reciprocity, transparency and accountability rather that trust between stakeholders or collaborators. Empirical studies are required to explore how these principles could inform best practices for data management and governance during PHE in sub-Saharan Africa.</ns3:p>",6,,11,,,,,,"Wellcome Trust; Department for International Development, UK Government",,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16494.2,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16494.2,,,0,005-637-499-969-670; 008-933-418-211-119; 011-613-162-652-791; 012-796-093-198-628; 014-756-944-023-161; 015-582-573-942-829; 016-267-593-890-591; 026-052-410-437-079; 028-031-533-669-566; 084-211-184-614-987; 101-659-463-464-328,1

Dove; Jiahong Chen,"• This article investigates an under-discussed and potentially significant provision in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), namely Article 9(2)(e), which permits processing of special category personal data if the “processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject”.; • This provision may be of increasing interest to data controllers in a variety of cloud-based, internet-related, and/or social media contexts. We specifically consider the application of this provision in the context of genetic data and open data sharing (i.e. data that can be freely used, re-used, and redistributed by anyone), illustrating this by way of several cases of initiatives that seek to share genetic data. We query whether by uploading one’s own genetic data onto the internet, a person has made their data “manifestly public” within the meaning of the GDPR.; • Our response to this query is that in general, the answer should be no, but it remains possible. We argue that Article 9(2)(e) must be construed narrowly; outside of clearly defined contexts, it would be legally inappropriate to invoke and rely upon this manifestly public self-disclosure exception in data protection law. Our narrow interpretation of the provision aligns with the limited guidance made available from data protection authorities. As part of this argument, we propose a legal test that must be satisfied before",11,2,107,124,Internet privacy; The Internet; Variety (cybernetics); Context (language use); Open data; General Data Protection Regulation; Argument; Computer science; Social media; Data Protection Act 1998,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/5251438 https://academic.oup.com/idpl/article/11/2/107/6146670,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/idpl/ipab005,,10.1093/idpl/ipab005,3130831340,,0,,0

This article discusses some of the important questions to consider in relation to the chosen method and synthesis approach. Software can support researchers in a range of ways. Here, a range of review conditions and software solutions. For example, facilitating contemporaneous collaboration across time and geographical space; in-built bias assessment tools; and line-by-line coding for qualitative textual analysis. EPPI-Reviewer is a review software for research synthesis managed by the EPPI-centre, UCL Institute of Education. EPPI-Reviewer has text mining automation technologies. Version 5 supports data sharing and re-use across the systematic review community. Open source software will soon be released. EPPI-Centre will continue to offer the software as a cloud-based service. The software is offered via a subscription with a one-month (extendible) trial available and volume discounts for 'site licences'. It is free to use for Cochrane and Campbell reviews. The next EPPI-Reviewer version is being built in collaboration with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence using 'surveillance' of newly published research to support 'living' iterative reviews. This is achieved using a combination of machine learning and traditional information retrieval technologies to identify the type of research each new publication describes and determine its relevance for a particular review, domain or guideline. While the amount of available knowledge and research is constantly increasing, the ways in which software can support the focus and relevance of data identification are also developing fast. Software advances are maximising the opportunities for the production of relevant and timely reviews.",23,4,140,141,Automation; Information management; Coding (social sciences); Data science; Excellence; Software; Data sharing; Evidence synthesis; Computer science; Cloud computing,information management; world wide web technology,Data Mining; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval/methods; Machine Learning; Software; Systematic Reviews as Topic,,Medical Research Council (MR/J005037/1) United Kingdom,https://ebm.bmj.com/content/early/2018/06/07/bmjebm-2018-110962 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10047986/ https://ebm.bmj.com/content/23/4/140 https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/29880698 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29880698/ https://ebm.bmj.com/content/ebmed/23/4/140.full.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29880698,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjebm-2018-110962,29880698,10.1136/bmjebm-2018-110962,2801836483,,0,067-622-228-125-318; 126-582-560-504-525,5

We present a Python solution, based on the CubicWeb open source semantic framework, aimed at building population imaging study repositories. In addition, we focus on the tools developed around this framework to overcome the challenges associated with data sharing and collaborative requirements. We describe a set of three highly adaptive web services that transform the CubicWeb framework into a (1) multi-center upload platform, (2) collaborative quality assessment platform, and (3) publication platform endowed with massive-download capabilities. Two major European projects, IMAGEN and EU-AIMS, are currently supported by the described framework.

The accuracy of estimates of dementia in the oldest-old and the controversial question of whether dementia incidence and prevalence decline at very old age will be crucial for better understanding the dynamics between survival to extreme old age and the occurrence and risk for various types of dementia and comorbidities. International Centenarian Consortium – Dementia (ICC-Dementia) seeks to harmonise centenarian and near-centenarian studies internationally to describe the cognitive and functional profiles of exceptionally old individuals, and ascertain the trajectories of decline and thereby the age-standardised prevalence and incidence of dementia in this population. The primary goal of the ICC-Dementia is to establish a large and thorough heterogeneous sample that has the power to answer epidemiological questions that small, separate studies cannot. A secondary aim is to examine cohort-specific effects and differential survivorship into very old age. We hope to lay the foundation for further investigation into risk and protective factors for dementia and healthy exceptional brain ageing in centenarians across diverse ethnoracial and sociocultural groups. Studies focusing on individuals aged ≥95 years (approximately the oldest 1 percentile for men, oldest 5th percentile for women), with a minimum sample of 80 individuals, including assessment of cognition and functional status, are invited to participate. There are currently seventeen member or potential member studies from Asia, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania. Initial attempts at harmonising key variables are in progress. General challenges facing large, international consortia like ICC-Dementia include timely and effective communication among member studies, ethical and practical issues relating to human subject studies and data sharing, and the challenges related to data harmonisation. A specific challenge for ICC-Dementia relates to the concept and definition of’abnormal’ in this exceptional group of individuals who are rarely free of physical, sensory and/or cognitive impairments.",16,1,52,52,Epidemiology; Cognition; Survivorship curve; Sociocultural evolution; Centenarian; Dementia; Population; Incidence (epidemiology); Medicine; Gerontology,Centenarians; Dementia; Incidence; International; Prevalence; Risk factors,"Aged, 80 and over; Brain/physiology; Cognition/physiology; Cognitive Dysfunction/epidemiology; Dementia/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Prevalence; Risk",,NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG021055) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG046949) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P01 AG17553-01A1) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG008017) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG038072) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P01 AG017553) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG08017) United States; Medical Research Council (G9901400) United Kingdom,https://core.ac.uk/display/141670115 https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/icc-dementia-international-centenarian-consortium-dementia-an-int https://ohsu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/icc-dementia-international-centenarian-consortium-dementia-an-int https://paperity.org/p/76061883/icc-dementia-international-centenarian-consortium-dementia-an-international-consortium-to https://einstein.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/icc-dementia-international-centenarian-consortium-dementia-an-int https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12883-016-0569-4 https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/hdfs_pubs/68/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12883-016-0569-4 https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/icc-dementia-international-centenarian-consortium-dementia-an-int https://works.bepress.com/peter-martin/11/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27098177 https://escholarship.org/content/qt4070w3rq/qt4070w3rq.pdf?t=pwmwhx https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27098177 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12883-016-0569-4.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27098177/ https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.atira.dk%3Apublications%2Fd50e375a-1271-4d12-a246-f3c0b12ef5d2 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12883-016-0569-4/fulltext.html https://research.vumc.nl/en/publications/icc-dementia-international-centenarian-consortium-dementia-an-int https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1069&context=hdfs_pubs https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4070w3rq https://core.ac.uk/download/162438029.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12883-016-0569-4,27098177,10.1186/s12883-016-0569-4,2335826053,PMC4839126,0,000-357-337-856-130; 000-460-650-632-323; 005-167-721-167-967; 010-763-737-285-732; 010-853-248-855-65X; 011-383-598-456-678; 011-723-883-527-699; 012-991-437-796-116; 013-781-092-986-715; 014-382-111-013-344; 014-767-130-721-191; 015-141-339-882-473; 015-971-776-811-895; 016-893-250-085-484; 017-035-967-594-919; 017-219-382-790-363; 019-002-258-907-400; 019-016-298-095-408; 019-153-866-851-891; 022-323-701-368-17X; 022-988-712-445-94X; 024-376-942-395-170; 025-913-141-061-717; 026-119-175-681-162; 028-773-950-116-789; 029-231-678-042-88X; 032-223-805-474-123; 032-307-716-085-36X; 034-036-547-507-533; 035-292-153-701-818; 035-787-374-518-333; 035-870-002-765-031; 036-420-250-328-023; 036-713-938-355-344; 037-014-687-467-125; 038-564-101-753-216; 039-811-900-172-823; 040-108-910-589-244; 040-778-216-252-433; 042-353-705-407-482; 044-438-835-744-28X; 047-357-000-954-320; 049-240-330-786-562; 051-444-721-640-129; 053-309-572-652-249; 053-903-943-220-915; 054-067-036-012-560; 057-666-201-674-482; 058-782-618-370-761; 060-638-493-203-593; 064-885-432-561-139; 068-865-428-808-888; 073-261-216-262-872; 075-498-816-093-257; 077-500-504-241-76X; 080-957-627-648-242; 084-560-958-239-451; 088-359-249-949-304; 089-379-209-087-281; 089-686-136-835-102; 093-242-020-418-419; 099-769-170-077-719; 107-306-991-494-509; 108-846-186-989-043; 110-069-593-674-311; 110-120-866-710-738; 111-686-256-547-282; 120-273-470-107-860; 122-462-000-972-388; 123-435-172-664-704; 125-983-588-230-184; 128-927-941-318-535; 130-206-095-507-151; 130-246-232-621-257; 130-814-301-012-379; 138-447-477-928-582; 161-533-477-870-071; 178-851-721-545-061; 187-790-500-214-330,18

The aim of this paper is to (1) outline observational thigh-worn accelerometry studies and (2) summarise key strategic directions arising from the inaugural ProPASS meeting. (1) We performed a systematic scoping review for observational studies of thigh-worn triaxial accelerometers in free-living adults (n≥100, 24 hours monitoring protocols). (2)Attendees of the inaugural ProPASS meeting were sent a survey focused on areas related to developing ProPASS: important terminology (Q1); accelerometry constructs (Q2); advantages and distinct contribution of the consortium (Q3); data pooling and harmonisation (Q4); data access and sharing (Q5 and Q6). (1) Eighty eligible articles were identified (22 primary studies; n~17 685). The accelerometers used most often were the ActivPAL3 and ActiGraph GT3X. The most commonly collected health outcomes were cardiometabolic and musculoskeletal. (2) None of the survey questions elicited the predefined 60% agreement. Survey responses recommended that ProPASS: use the term physical behaviour or movement behaviour rather than 'physical activity' for the data we are collecting (Q1); make only minor changes to ProPASS's accelerometry construct (Q2); prioritise developing standardised protocols/tools (Q4); facilitate flexible methods of data sharing and access (Q5 and Q6). Thigh-worn accelerometry is an emerging method of capturing movement and posture across the 24 hours cycle. In 2020, the literature is limited to 22 primary studies from high-income western countries. This work identified ProPASS's strategic directions-indicating areas where ProPASS can most benefit the field of research: use of clear terminology, refinement of the measured construct, standardised protocols/tools and flexible data sharing.

Abdallah; Emmanouil Benetos; Nicolas Gold; Steven Hargreaves; Tillman Weyde; Daniel Wolff,"In musicology and music research generally, the increasing availability of digital music, storage capacities, and computing power enable and require new and intelligent systems. In the transition from traditional to digital musicology, many techniques and tools have been developed for the analysis of individual pieces of music, but large-scale music data that are increasingly becoming available require research methods and systems that work on the collection-level and at scale. Although many relevant algorithms have been developed during the past 15 years of research in Music Information Retrieval, an integrated system that supports large-scale digital musicology research has so far been lacking.In the Digital Music Lab (DML) project, a collaboration among music librarians, musicologists, computer scientists, and human-computer interface specialists, the DML software system has been developed that fills this gap by providing intelligent large-scale music analysis with a user-friendly interactive interface supporting musicologists in their exploration and enquiry. The DML system empowers musicologists by addressing several challenges: distributed processing of audio and other music data, management of the data analysis process and results, remote analysis of data under copyright, logical inference on the extracted information and metadata, and visual web-based interfaces for exploring and querying the music collections. The DML system is scalable and based on Semantic Web technology and integrates into Linked Data with the vision of a distributed system that enables music research across archives, libraries, and other providers of music data. A first DML system prototype has been set up in collaboration with the British Library and I Like Music Ltd. This system has been used to analyse a diverse corpus of currently 250,000 music tracks. In this article, we describe the DML system requirements, design, architecture, components, and available data sources, explaining their interaction. We report use cases and applications with initial evaluations of the proposed system.",10,1,2,21,World Wide Web; Music theory; Musicology; Music information retrieval; Computer science; Multimedia; Pop music automation; Big data; Digital audio; Music and artificial intelligence; Metadata,,,,“An Integrated Audio-Symbolic Model of Music Similarity”; UK Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded projects “Digital Music Lab--Analysing Big Music Data”; UK Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Platform,https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/15701 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3034773.2983918 https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2983918 http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1514443/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jocch/jocch10.html#AbdallahBGHWW17 https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/16481/ https://core.ac.uk/download/82917190.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2983918,,10.1145/2983918,2560963696,,0,001-072-341-296-444; 010-468-237-615-844; 010-830-877-257-634; 010-898-074-454-213; 011-241-717-579-539; 018-265-914-594-683; 021-372-410-013-293; 022-547-887-650-474; 022-823-090-994-075; 022-856-016-884-514; 023-267-115-728-745; 027-200-409-409-554; 029-413-294-433-563; 029-703-498-684-394; 030-332-952-550-907; 031-475-686-084-142; 034-801-418-824-335; 043-841-873-549-438; 047-123-380-656-875; 054-589-312-852-944; 055-013-569-282-363; 063-480-453-284-263; 063-666-779-855-72X; 067-452-178-731-790; 071-499-040-130-119; 078-687-748-758-49X; 080-235-840-779-386; 081-331-580-165-906; 083-069-804-089-386; 084-886-966-752-677; 091-662-007-790-716; 095-904-929-227-000; 096-116-678-611-065; 101-785-311-813-725; 110-942-661-783-370; 110-965-091-567-263; 111-174-580-982-869; 131-829-590-753-736; 133-715-492-881-520; 135-297-889-867-034; 137-292-579-653-532; 138-121-698-728-293; 147-037-310-445-866; 150-513-959-872-232; 154-611-475-554-291; 156-662-785-302-981; 156-904-471-144-887; 167-789-847-781-015; 173-336-074-064-57X; 175-711-171-861-508; 194-617-438-272-779,15

However, there is no systematic research into alcohol industry-funded youth education programmes. This article serves to address this important gap in the literature.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Using a discourse theoretical approach informed by poststructural discourse theory and critical discourse analysis, we analysed teaching materials from three school-based youth education initiatives which focus on alcohol consumption and health harms: Drinkaware for Education, The Smashed Project (funded by Diageo), and Talk About Alcohol (Alcohol Education Trust). These materials, some of which are disseminated internationally, are provided to schools through intermediary bodies in receipt of alcohol industry funding.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The analysis found that these materials drew from and presented discourses of personal responsibility, moderate alcohol consumption, and involved a narrowing of the problem definition and causes. The locus of the problem is located by the discourses within individuals including youth, with causes of youth alcohol consumption repeatedly presented as peer pressure and 'poor choices', with little or no mention of alcohol industry marketing or other practices. All programmes promoted familiarisation and normalisation of alcohol as a 'normal' adult consumer product which children must learn about and master how to use responsibly when older. The discourses constructed in these materials closely align with those of other alcohol industry corporate social responsibility discourses which employ selective presentation of harms, including misinformation about cancer, and ambiguous terms such as ""responsible drinking"". Furthermore, the role of alcohol price, availability and access, and the impacts of alcohol and the industry on inequities were not articulated within the discourses. The research was limited to an analysis of teaching materials and further research is needed to explore their impact on youth, teachers and wider discourses and social norms.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Alcohol industry-sponsored youth education programmes serve industry interests and promote moderate consumption while purportedly educating children about harms and influences of alcohol use. There are considerable conflicts of interest in the delivery of alcohol education programmes funded by the alcohol industry and intermediary bodies in receipt of such funding. Alcohol education materials should be developed independent from industry, including funding, and should empower children and young people to understand and think critically about alcohol, including harms and drivers of consumption, and effective interventions needed to protect them and others from alcohol-related harms. Independent organisations can use this analysis to critique their materials to strengthen alignment with meeting student and public health interests. The ongoing exposure of children and young people to such conflicted and misleading materials needs urgent attention from policymakers, practitioners, teachers and parents, and resources dependent on industry support should cease being used in schools.</AbstractText>",17,1,e0259560,,,,,,"National Institute for Health Research; SPECTRUM; SPECTRUM; SPECTRUM; Medical Research Council; Chief Scientist Office, Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorate; NRS Senior Clinical Fellowship",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259560,35020741,10.1371/journal.pone.0259560,,PMC8754310,0,001-529-493-490-657; 004-075-803-459-600; 004-405-972-985-82X; 007-459-504-249-242; 010-151-066-959-056; 011-341-959-912-865; 012-086-350-479-177; 012-481-591-051-905; 013-553-703-858-372; 014-313-796-212-629; 017-296-261-791-633; 017-925-162-106-695; 017-955-887-406-465; 018-349-568-285-316; 019-121-680-529-347; 023-012-892-066-446; 023-150-085-368-187; 024-463-401-514-021; 025-531-187-861-601; 028-738-531-903-303; 033-708-101-326-319; 038-075-271-733-093; 039-171-699-779-638; 040-734-839-898-527; 040-796-737-795-790; 043-352-120-729-015; 043-484-838-664-956; 046-197-610-878-779; 047-990-194-383-362; 051-539-603-415-475; 055-270-003-867-968; 056-760-763-041-139; 058-787-361-381-627; 060-270-237-650-607; 062-473-095-312-102; 062-603-195-103-845; 063-477-108-115-939; 065-594-391-948-201; 067-385-038-945-271; 068-057-505-253-586; 071-834-992-582-855; 072-815-250-696-733; 073-203-453-131-272; 077-166-855-958-497; 079-580-004-172-775; 088-556-543-012-435; 091-531-937-828-960; 095-507-434-318-913; 101-013-227-282-247; 101-029-782-819-919; 103-282-812-240-708; 110-029-473-099-897; 119-016-809-497-691; 120-706-069-961-703; 121-879-852-280-362; 122-287-033-367-082; 122-640-487-602-811; 125-195-928-009-121; 127-070-586-469-200; 135-028-320-118-244; 135-333-603-302-181; 135-747-169-917-385; 139-169-001-598-206; 155-262-397-159-440; 156-015-173-637-907; 156-548-326-838-171; 159-077-842-558-812; 168-112-830-600-371; 168-772-184-798-478; 178-880-089-431-660; 188-487-229-855-521; 198-564-363-495-239,0

Venkiteswaran; Pascal Boeckx; Daren C. Gooddy,"Modern anthropogenic activities have significantly increased nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in surface waters. Stable isotopes (δ15N and δ18O) in NO3- offer a tool to deconvolute some of the human-made changes in the nitrogen cycle. They are often graphically illustrated on a template designed to identify different sources of NO3- and denitrification. In the two decades since this template was developed, δ15N- and δ18O-NO3- have been measured in a variety of ecosystems and through the nitrogen cycle. However, its interpretation is often fuzzy or complex. This default is no longer helpful because it does not describe surface water ecosystems well and biases researchers towards denitrification as the NO3- removal pathway, even in well oxygenated systems where denitrification is likely to have little to no influence on the nitrogen cycle. We propose a different scheme to encourage a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle and interpretation of NO3- isotopes. We use a mechanistic understanding of NO3- formation to place bounds on the oxygen isotope axis and provide a means to adjust for different environmental water isotope values, so data from multiple sites and times of year can be appropriately compared. We demonstrate that any interpretation of our example datasets (Canada, Kenya, United Kingdom) show clear evidence of denitrification or a mixture of NO3- sources simply because many data points fall outside of arbitrary boxes which cannot be supported once the range of potential δ18O-NO3- values has been considered.",4,,100037,,Ecosystem; Earth science; Stable isotope ratio; Nitrate; Environmental science; Nitrogen cycle; δ18O; Isotopes of oxygen; Denitrification; Surface water,,,,International Atomic Energy Agency; NSERC; NERC,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589915519300215 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8648297 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8648297/file/8648299.pdf https://eartharxiv.org/repository/object/1339/download/3024/ https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/1339/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589915519300215 https://core.ac.uk/download/287941172.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hydroa.2019.100037,,10.1016/j.hydroa.2019.100037,2965510155,,0,002-133-116-956-429; 002-914-744-827-726; 003-261-661-694-180; 005-870-279-484-605; 007-582-370-932-962; 008-504-704-938-364; 009-036-125-395-301; 010-772-918-343-932; 011-563-409-320-498; 012-012-097-081-891; 016-065-953-203-359; 016-465-200-128-174; 016-648-171-715-311; 016-970-669-778-593; 021-227-002-702-937; 021-743-702-069-862; 022-070-040-838-054; 022-454-344-942-005; 022-492-543-343-766; 027-950-556-395-60X; 039-691-123-543-728; 039-833-611-342-010; 041-606-538-207-737; 042-082-505-301-016; 043-234-881-551-357; 043-487-354-466-500; 044-623-824-669-282; 045-581-354-414-122; 046-819-229-723-421; 050-676-425-930-419; 056-403-385-362-502; 058-142-355-823-494; 071-538-902-315-424; 072-058-772-036-200; 074-118-896-430-634; 080-432-391-061-127; 088-269-866-025-239; 090-560-858-409-860; 096-131-671-540-861; 103-260-046-667-560; 107-026-761-023-49X; 110-347-001-539-026; 118-910-433-546-589; 122-143-862-872-024; 134-870-781-372-622; 138-762-735-726-300; 149-276-783-607-651; 152-047-953-677-206; 154-875-080-860-453; 167-125-895-725-219; 171-003-968-761-894; 177-795-164-678-127; 189-551-968-594-556,11

Social scientists working in the genomics arena ask the public ‘how is the technology working for you?’ Empirical studies on attitudes, values and beliefs are incredibly valuable; they offer a voice from those who are, or will be, directly affected. This is paramount if personalised medicine is to be truly personal. An International attitude study, Your DNA, Your Say, uses film to provide background information and an online survey to gather public views on donating one's own personal DNA and medical data for use by others.

6011,135-895-322-710-247,Gamification of Cognitive Assessment and Cognitive Training: A Systematic Review of Applications and Efficacy,2016-07-15,2016,journal article,JMIR serious games,22919279,JMIR Publications Inc.,Canada,Jim Lumsden; Elizabeth A. Edwards; Natalia Lawrence; David Coyle; Marcus R. Munafò,"Background: Cognitive tasks are typically viewed as effortful, frustrating, and repetitive, which often leads to participant disengagement. This, in turn, may negatively impact data quality and/or reduce intervention effects. However, gamification may provide a possible solution. If game design features can be incorporated into cognitive tasks without undermining their scientific value, then data quality, intervention effects, and participant engagement may be improved. Objectives: This systematic review aims to explore and evaluate the ways in which gamification has already been used for cognitive training and assessment purposes. We hope to answer 3 questions: (1) Why have researchers opted to use gamification? (2) What domains has gamification been applied in? (3) How successful has gamification been in cognitive research thus far? Methods: We systematically searched several Web-based databases, searching the titles, abstracts, and keywords of database entries using the search strategy (gamif* OR game OR games) AND (cognit* OR engag* OR behavi* OR health* OR attention OR motiv*). Searches included papers published in English between January 2007 and October 2015. Results: Our review identified 33 relevant studies, covering 31 gamified cognitive tasks used across a range of disorders and cognitive domains. We identified 7 reasons for researchers opting to gamify their cognitive training and testing. We found that working memory and general executive functions were common targets for both gamified assessment and training. Gamified tests were typically validated successfully, although mixed-domain measurement was a problem. Gamified training appears to be highly engaging and does boost participant motivation, but mixed effects of gamification on task performance were reported. Conclusions: Heterogeneous study designs and typically small sample sizes highlight the need for further research in both gamified training and testing. Nevertheless, careful application of gamification can provide a way to develop engaging and yet scientifically valid cognitive assessments, and it is likely worthwhile to continue to develop gamified cognitive tasks in the future.

Knudsen,"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging has become a prominent tool to capture the spatiotemporal distribution of neurotransmitters and receptors in the brain. The outcome of a PET study can, however, potentially be obscured by suboptimal and/or inconsistent choices made in complex processing pipelines required to reach a quantitative estimate of radioligand binding. Variations in subject selection, experimental design, data acquisition, preprocessing, and statistical analysis may lead to different outcomes and neurobiological interpretations. We here review the approaches used in 105 original research articles published by 21 different PET centres, using the tracer [11C]DASB for quantification of cerebral serotonin transporter binding, as an exemplary case. We highlight and quantify the impact of the remarkable variety of ways in which researchers are currently conducting their studies, while implicitly expecting generalizable results across research groups. Our review provides evidence that the foundation for a given choice of a preprocessing pipeline seems to be an overlooked aspect in modern PET neuroscience. Furthermore, we believe that a thorough testing of pipeline performance is necessary to produce reproducible research outcomes, avoiding biased results and allowing for better understanding of human brain function.",39,2,210,222,Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Positron emission tomography; Human brain; Serotonin transporter; DASB; Research groups; 11c dasb; Preprocessor; Computer science; Pipeline (software),Positron Emission Tomography; [C]DASB; data sharing; kinetic modeling; preprocessing,Benzylamines/therapeutic use; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Carbon Radioisotopes/therapeutic use; Female; Humans; Male; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals/therapeutic use; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins/metabolism,"Benzylamines; Carbon Radioisotopes; N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio)benzylamine; Radiopharmaceuticals; Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins",Medical Research Council (G1100809) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/N026063/1) United Kingdom; NIBIB NIH HHS (R21 EB018964) United States,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29651896/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29651896 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0271678X18770107 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/66886832/manuscript_JCBFM_accepted_08032018.pdf https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0271678X18770107 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/cerebral-serotonin-transporter-measurements-with-11cdasb-a-review-on-acquisition-and-preprocessing-across-21-pet-centres(7064c982-6255-4747-a478-3d5a46c281a2).html http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0271678X18770107 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1202095,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0271678x18770107,29651896,10.1177/0271678x18770107,2789366119,PMC6365604,0,000-152-330-495-441; 001-828-511-031-834; 002-492-168-990-041; 003-100-392-440-432; 003-213-657-632-124; 003-462-894-126-337; 004-856-889-521-672; 005-884-147-863-790; 005-886-404-574-682; 007-453-159-364-401; 008-429-806-650-970; 009-360-705-063-535; 010-889-336-998-428; 010-935-506-208-80X; 011-376-912-526-692; 013-012-532-869-998; 014-189-490-517-440; 018-867-502-029-037; 019-966-610-980-647; 021-959-266-334-705; 022-206-420-817-140; 023-372-464-572-069; 023-447-253-569-787; 023-908-231-622-590; 024-579-547-458-960; 025-055-246-851-645; 028-978-814-078-684; 029-149-673-121-439; 029-388-668-501-718; 030-425-337-421-604; 031-148-939-027-376; 031-433-985-689-795; 031-955-668-019-083; 034-082-378-287-206; 035-319-142-835-332; 037-733-593-200-21X; 039-665-527-412-303; 040-880-212-846-593; 042-012-566-678-294; 042-036-274-586-108; 044-310-186-482-562; 045-015-613-061-055; 047-243-054-242-008; 050-720-380-078-036; 051-550-424-611-515; 056-318-752-811-407; 057-038-307-989-709; 059-587-754-746-076; 062-635-763-449-446; 063-409-362-842-74X; 065-569-521-358-476; 066-125-396-354-466; 067-529-180-259-82X; 070-804-733-061-357; 071-227-349-279-22X; 074-220-052-413-392; 078-616-863-245-456; 078-694-803-676-477; 087-386-391-738-804; 090-501-692-282-686; 091-782-032-194-592; 098-296-690-784-173; 104-981-746-609-202; 108-365-020-500-925; 119-014-235-469-421; 128-820-198-790-269; 129-586-924-276-365; 137-964-703-997-201; 143-301-025-507-188; 155-706-526-606-062; 164-548-277-148-966; 170-668-253-255-330,21

As such there is interest in how it can be taught in schools. However, the majority of teaching focuses on small, personally collected data which is easier for students to relate to. This does not give the students the breadth of experience they need for dealing with the larger, complex data that is collected at scale and used to drive the intelligent systems that people engage with during work and leisure time. Neither does it prepare them for future jobs, which increasingly require skills for critically querying and deriving insights from data. This paper addresses this gap by trialling a method for teaching from complex data, collected through a smart city project. The main contribution is to show that existing data principles from the literature can be adapted to design data literacy activities that help pupils understand complex data collected by others and form interesting questions and hypotheses about it. It also demonstrates how smart city ideas and concepts can be brought to life in the classroom. The Urban Data School study was carried out over two years in three primary and secondary schools in England, using smart city datasets. Three teachers took part, providing access to different age groups, subject areas, and class types. This resulted in four distinctive field studies, with 67 students aged between 10–14 years, each lasting a few weeks within the two year period. The studies provide evidence that when engaging with data that has not been personally collected, activities designed to give the experience of collecting the data can help in critiquing it.",129,,41,54,Sociology; Mathematics education; Work (electrical); Class (computer programming); Smart city; Data literacy; Field (computer science); Literacy; Intelligent decision support system; Scale (social sciences),,,,Higher Education Funding Council for England; Higher Education Funding Council for England,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.03.006 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijmms/ijmms129.html#WolffWP19 http://oro.open.ac.uk/59762/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581919300217 https://core.ac.uk/download/189591627.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.03.006,,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2019.03.006,2931150627,,0,002-434-487-318-281; 005-242-395-332-302; 013-119-111-595-159; 013-698-724-398-616; 019-753-578-787-783; 020-375-841-770-664; 021-868-027-758-97X; 025-486-437-317-028; 027-281-608-307-136; 032-139-818-483-457; 035-847-956-566-556; 045-119-736-214-652; 056-071-680-209-30X; 058-266-330-108-384; 059-507-744-657-085; 072-344-952-886-883; 073-109-511-523-602; 075-880-387-122-298; 080-211-307-211-956; 081-459-551-397-911; 092-259-534-150-506; 105-823-851-984-306; 118-357-255-484-504; 124-114-420-700-639; 127-554-063-576-366; 131-063-119-289-816; 155-787-417-716-462; 160-619-579-373-667; 166-346-933-424-808; 168-391-273-325-34X; 170-425-101-267-491,12

Willis,"Summary; Species distribution models (SDMs) are important tools for forecasting the potential impacts of future environmental changes but debate remains over the most robust modelling approaches for making projections.; Suggested improvements in SDMs vary from algorithmic development through to more mechanistic modelling approaches. Here, we focus on the improvements that can be gained by conditioning SDMs on more detailed data. Specifically, we use breeding bird data from across Europe to compare the relative performances of SDMs trained on presence–absence data and those trained on abundance data.; Species distribution models trained on presence–absence data, with a poor to slight fit according to Cohen's kappa, show an average improvement in model performance of 0·32 (SE ± 0·12) when trained on abundance data. Even those species for which models trained on presence–absence data are classified as good to excellent show a mean improvement in Cohen's kappa score of 0·05 (SE ± 0·01) when corresponding SDMs are trained on abundance data. This improved explanatory power is most pronounced for species of high prevalence.; Our results illustrate that even using coarse scale abundance data, large improvements in our ability to predict species distributions can be achieved. Furthermore, predictions from abundance models provide a greater depth of information with regard to population dynamics than their presence–absence model counterparts. Currently, despite the existence of a wide variety of abundance data sets, species distribution modellers continue to rely almost exclusively on presence–absence data to train and test SDMs. Given our findings, we advocate that, where available, abundance data rather than presence–absence data can be used to more accurately predict the ecological consequences of environmental change. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of informative baseline data sets. We therefore recommend the move towards increased collection of abundance data, even if only coarse numerical scales of recording are possible.",5,6,506,513,Environmental niche modelling; Statistics; Species distribution; Econometrics; Random forest; Environmental change; Kappa; Population; Environmental science; Scale (map); Abundance (ecology),,,,Natural Environment Research Council,https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12184 https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12184 https://dro.dur.ac.uk/12000/ https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/2041-210X.12184 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12184/full http://dro.dur.ac.uk/12000/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12184 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/19908290.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210x.12184,,10.1111/2041-210x.12184,1986520077,,0,003-223-037-571-948; 005-652-910-537-33X; 008-294-789-594-616; 008-519-818-028-336; 011-015-247-674-463; 011-531-085-677-151; 012-603-273-570-155; 016-925-662-069-310; 017-203-471-022-028; 017-455-651-201-817; 018-719-012-591-84X; 019-615-379-146-136; 020-772-704-016-445; 021-365-164-298-741; 026-173-827-919-170; 028-284-843-288-027; 030-121-442-804-129; 030-745-890-797-263; 031-056-855-501-837; 035-081-326-853-407; 035-313-557-861-746; 036-305-861-741-374; 036-628-246-488-238; 040-058-016-041-863; 042-203-151-667-827; 043-624-657-891-561; 044-726-648-494-47X; 045-201-107-411-584; 045-584-985-422-245; 046-396-839-268-137; 048-928-143-845-060; 050-189-297-693-827; 051-271-985-480-584; 052-464-383-066-148; 055-208-871-302-118; 058-412-352-393-334; 058-627-818-566-996; 060-028-783-385-526; 061-013-290-045-456; 062-830-659-904-422; 062-852-160-830-177; 069-468-889-004-361; 070-583-205-858-614; 072-582-634-416-564; 073-155-361-098-782; 073-823-452-289-008; 073-977-220-319-580; 078-788-785-041-407; 079-261-909-912-581; 080-212-555-597-784; 081-114-450-291-241; 081-120-759-815-77X; 083-342-491-139-366; 086-244-055-958-349; 087-796-285-900-558; 089-257-427-127-83X; 092-284-072-192-705; 099-256-885-957-054; 102-612-611-166-831; 111-348-794-739-554; 112-983-037-674-828; 113-724-279-433-680; 116-295-596-171-991; 120-800-914-436-836; 121-555-049-559-46X; 122-737-084-980-907; 123-498-859-171-509; 130-144-700-175-896; 133-472-086-460-241; 134-074-608-094-115; 138-965-481-748-71X; 148-484-026-119-685; 150-325-162-873-23X; 155-769-665-172-194; 156-769-280-292-837; 159-721-769-832-735; 163-141-986-200-658; 163-605-944-794-809; 169-677-859-853-22X; 170-822-556-934-763; 171-904-516-694-131; 184-580-225-044-108; 185-658-733-898-509; 186-987-959-630-066; 190-365-229-770-698; 190-872-124-925-813; 194-387-493-171-857; 194-975-268-161-725,115

Williams; Saffron O'Neill,"Policymakers, scholars, and practitioners have all called attention to the issue of misinformation in the climate change debate. But what is climate change misinformation, who is involved, how does it spread, why does it matter, and what can be done about it? Climate change misinformation is closely linked to climate change skepticism, denial, and contrarianism. A network of actors are involved in financing, producing, and amplifying misinformation. Once in the public domain, characteristics of online social networks, such as homophily, polarization, and echo chambers—characteristics also found in climate change debate—provide fertile ground for misinformation to spread. Underlying belief systems and social norms, as well as psychological heuristics such as confirmation bias, are further factors which contribute to the spread of misinformation. A variety of ways to understand and address misinformation, from a diversity of disciplines, are discussed. These include educational, technological, regulatory, and psychological‐based approaches. No single approach addresses all concerns about misinformation, and all have limitations, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach to tackle this multifaceted issue. Key research gaps include understanding the diffusion of climate change misinformation on social media, and examining whether misinformation extends to climate alarmism, as well as climate denial. This article explores the concepts of misinformation and disinformation and defines disinformation to be a subset of misinformation. A diversity of disciplinary and interdisciplinary literature is reviewed to fully interrogate the concept of misinformation—and within this, disinformation—particularly as it pertains to climate change.

McEachan; Laura Sheard,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 vaccines can offer a route out of the pandemic, yet initial research suggests that many are unwilling to be vaccinated. A rise in the spread of misinformation is thought to have played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy. To maximize uptake, it is important to understand why misinformation has been able to take hold at this time and why it may pose a more significant problem within certain contexts. OBJECTIVE: To understand people's COVID-19 beliefs, their interactions with (mis)information during COVID-19 and attitudes towards a COVID-19 vaccine. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Bradford, UK, was chosen as the study site to provide evidence to local decision makers. In-depth phone interviews were carried out with 20 people from different ethnic groups and areas of Bradford during Autumn 2020. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Participants discussed a wide range of COVID-19 misinformation they had encountered, resulting in confusion, distress and mistrust. Vaccine hesitancy could be attributed to three prominent factors: safety concerns, negative stories and personal knowledge. The more confused, distressed and mistrusting participants felt about their social worlds during the pandemic, the less positive they were about a vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy needs to be understood in the context of the relationship between the spread of misinformation and associated emotional reactions. Vaccine programmes should provide a focused, localized and empathetic response to counter misinformation. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: A rapid community and stakeholder engagement process was undertaken to identify COVID-19 priority topics important to Bradford citizens and decision makers.",24,4,1158,1167,Reflexivity; Ethnic group; Psychology; Qualitative research; Misinformation; Context (language use); Stakeholder engagement; Public relations; Thematic analysis; Personal knowledge base,Bradford; COVID-19; misinformation; qualitative; vaccine hesitancy,COVID-19; COVID-19 Vaccines; Communication; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; United Kingdom; Vaccines,COVID-19 Vaccines; Vaccines,Medical Research Council (MR/S037527/1) United Kingdom; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR200166); Health Foundation (2301201); Wellcome Trust (WT101597MA) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33942948 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/hex.13240 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942948 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33942948/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239544 https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/173750/ https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/es/covidwho-1214790 https://doaj.org/article/96fafd04780d4450b428df11b617b630 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hex.13240,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/hex.13240,33942948,10.1111/hex.13240,3159617949,PMC8239544,0,006-668-132-477-803; 010-604-300-266-434; 010-667-118-871-425; 015-024-310-333-494; 015-406-210-891-521; 016-432-178-177-488; 016-897-163-777-333; 020-098-087-337-275; 020-645-422-792-25X; 021-477-889-579-707; 023-876-702-126-822; 024-486-994-756-449; 024-549-138-764-660; 032-297-977-184-909; 037-317-749-249-405; 039-195-909-384-113; 041-751-351-325-46X; 054-544-296-786-772; 055-266-974-875-141; 055-419-125-192-623; 055-995-670-841-41X; 057-459-584-000-79X; 066-126-995-957-562; 078-112-856-718-543; 087-109-966-627-65X; 087-392-905-725-148; 087-796-285-757-341; 100-858-262-209-676; 107-127-993-224-621; 110-671-025-667-203; 130-031-134-465-950; 135-609-642-875-649,21

Burton; Jeremy Hoffman,"Background Nepal was under a severe lockdown for several months in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were concerns regarding misinformation circulating on social media. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 amongst eye care professionals in Nepal during the first wave of the pandemic. Methodology We invited 600 participants from 12 ophthalmic centres across Nepal to complete a qualitative, anonymous online survey. Altogether, 25 questions (both open and closed-ended) were used. An overall performance score was calculated from the average of the 12 ""Knowledge"" questions for all the participants. Results Of the 600 eye care professionals invited, 310 (51%) participated in the survey. The symptoms of COVID-19 were known to 94%, whilst only 49% of the participants were aware how the disease was transmitted, with 54% aware that anyone can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Almost 98% of participants recognized the World Health Organization's (WHO) awareness message, but surprisingly, 41% of participants felt that consumption of hot drinks helps to destroy the virus, in contradiction to WHO information. Importantly, 95% of the participants were aware of personal protective equipment (PPE) and what the acronym stands for. Social distancing was felt to be key to limiting the disease spread; whilst 41% disagreed that PPE should be mandatory for eye care practitioners. The mean overall ""Knowledge"" performance score was 69.65% (SD ± 22.81). Conclusion There is still considerable scope to improve the knowledge of COVID-19 amongst ophthalmic professionals in Nepal. Opinion is also split on measures to prevent transmission, with misinformation potentially fuelling confusion. It is recommended to follow WHO and national guidelines, whilst seeking published scientific evidence behind any unofficial statements, to accurately inform one's clinical practice.",16,7,e0254761,,Scientific evidence; Psychology; Social distance; Misinformation; Disease; MEDLINE; Personal protective equipment; Family medicine; Social media; Pandemic,,"Adult; COVID-19/epidemiology; Communication; Eye; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel/psychology; Humans; Male; Nepal/epidemiology; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (207472/Z/17/Z) United Kingdom,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34288939/?fc=20200713154434&ff=20210722045119&v=2.14.5 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254761 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294537 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021PLoSO..1654761S/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288939 https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/pt/covidwho-1319517 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0254761 https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/ppmedrxiv-20123505,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254761,34288939,10.1371/journal.pone.0254761,3185447909,PMC8294537,0,001-099-408-563-130; 001-281-857-268-277; 004-719-831-302-134; 006-185-699-645-541; 006-990-485-901-708; 008-538-692-105-968; 014-757-877-696-095; 015-380-945-234-378; 017-467-405-774-810; 027-644-701-203-980; 039-042-210-743-760; 039-147-737-655-987; 044-705-806-035-701; 045-593-197-891-117; 051-206-755-758-180; 054-729-661-009-21X; 066-989-892-141-484; 071-403-187-935-385; 081-118-560-654-582; 086-054-986-829-310; 091-968-477-252-383; 111-233-173-547-816; 144-781-526-712-421; 165-011-489-512-068; 196-315-421-698-289,1

Spearing; Kimberley A. Wade,"Recent studies suggest that highly confident eyewitnesses are likely to provide highly accurate identification evidence, at least in some conditions. Yet few studies have investigated the confidence-accuracy relationship in witness interviews or exactly when confidence judgments should be taken. Across three experiments, 831 adults answered questions about a mock crime and rated their confidence in each response. Participants gave their confidence immediately after each response or at the end of the memory test. The timing of the confidence judgment did not affect the confidence-accuracy relationship, and the confidence-accuracy relationship remained strong even when participants encoded the event under poor visibility conditions. When participants were unknowingly exposed to misinformation, however, the confidence-accuracy relationship was substantially weakened—participants became highly over-confident in the accuracy of their memories. These findings help to refine the parameters in which witness confidence serves as a useful indicator of memory accuracy.",,,,,Psychology; Witness; Misinformation; Memory test; Affect (psychology); Social psychology; Identification (information),,,,University of Warwick,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211368121000309 https://europepmc.org/article/PPR/PPR320735,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmac.2021.04.004,,10.1016/j.jarmac.2021.04.004,3160475946,,0,003-265-499-577-434; 004-502-221-528-796; 004-916-793-715-319; 005-348-289-357-341; 006-791-316-137-25X; 010-150-302-588-978; 010-867-890-367-351; 014-153-093-060-534; 017-553-404-157-133; 017-594-358-599-096; 017-792-716-835-309; 018-500-202-305-246; 019-247-050-727-545; 022-019-816-445-386; 022-585-450-113-681; 023-499-344-478-981; 024-874-105-929-341; 024-942-918-005-092; 025-737-152-935-977; 025-750-482-680-627; 025-837-764-478-082; 026-920-548-490-11X; 027-007-319-180-106; 029-729-634-118-318; 030-236-501-535-791; 036-521-695-648-030; 041-772-094-507-598; 042-010-736-777-764; 042-031-211-890-775; 042-828-197-455-459; 045-317-506-848-454; 045-630-073-023-49X; 046-497-427-246-938; 046-768-276-590-783; 049-333-236-942-138; 050-128-988-451-262; 052-357-523-082-366; 052-761-004-597-880; 055-934-751-156-749; 056-625-030-235-372; 059-304-257-268-832; 060-556-844-405-623; 063-061-802-487-231; 064-060-569-852-74X; 064-199-851-984-902; 065-277-062-030-871; 068-419-742-160-397; 069-877-229-568-062; 074-489-460-334-45X; 078-098-271-626-952; 079-356-345-106-550; 088-057-709-982-188; 089-652-337-855-462; 094-029-776-862-660; 101-384-941-635-882; 105-960-119-054-133; 108-291-241-933-549; 108-460-900-091-846; 122-143-419-806-962; 125-180-225-994-629; 137-870-187-627-310; 144-208-150-554-450; 146-087-842-852-824; 156-445-779-298-786; 160-595-846-574-401; 167-275-555-617-549; 178-519-087-228-549,0

Wilkinson; Reinout van Crevel; Anthony Figaji; Guy E. Thwaites,"Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe and disabling form of tuberculosis (TB), accounting for around 1-5% of the global TB caseload, with mortality of approximately 20% in children and up to 60% in persons co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus even in those treated. Relatively few centres of excellence in TBM research exist and the field would therefore benefit from greater co-ordination, advocacy, collaboration and early data sharing. To this end, in 2009, 2015 and 2019 we convened the TBM International Research Consortium, bringing together approximately 50 researchers from five continents. The most recent meeting took place on 1 st and 2 nd March 2019 in Lucknow, India. During the meeting, researchers and clinicians presented updates in their areas of expertise, and additionally presented on the knowledge gaps and research priorities in that field. Discussion during the meeting was followed by the development, by a core writing group, of a synthesis of knowledge gaps and research priorities within seven domains, namely epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy, host-directed therapy, critical care and implementation science. These were circulated to the whole consortium for written input and feedback. Further cycles of discussion between the writing group took place to arrive at a consensus series of priorities. This article summarises the consensus reached by the consortium concerning the unmet needs and priorities for future research for this neglected and often fatal disease.",4,,188,188,Epidemiology; Political science; Tuberculous meningitis; Excellence; Data sharing; Tuberculosis; International research; Fatal disease; Unmet needs; Family medicine,Care Cascade; Critical Care; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Research Priorities; Treatment; Tuberculosis; Tuberculous Meningitis,,,NIAID NIH HHS (K08 AI139371) United States; Medical Research Council (MR/R007942/1) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7014926 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7014926 https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/1077022 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-188/v1/pdf https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-188 https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-188/v1/xml https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/76109,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15573.1,32118120,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15573.1,2989855163,PMC7014926,0,000-286-986-959-011; 000-381-234-397-461; 000-544-116-453-462; 001-394-697-194-221; 001-580-526-654-157; 001-922-663-764-341; 002-195-579-523-041; 003-128-574-649-67X; 005-429-068-277-094; 007-317-738-263-203; 007-616-850-146-808; 007-798-024-790-669; 007-822-094-939-577; 008-468-629-210-123; 008-659-682-585-102; 009-844-209-691-234; 009-899-224-743-993; 010-016-447-491-432; 010-111-638-313-44X; 010-542-516-223-74X; 010-986-557-182-873; 014-102-689-378-754; 015-330-690-774-149; 015-633-209-502-437; 018-006-842-103-593; 018-296-081-355-531; 019-509-917-052-921; 020-442-348-638-202; 020-806-114-607-029; 025-632-051-546-592; 025-737-396-829-222; 026-741-554-137-554; 027-760-447-494-134; 028-638-489-250-936; 029-966-485-667-661; 030-039-231-149-678; 031-204-656-056-63X; 039-376-403-401-361; 040-007-638-850-710; 041-907-911-668-638; 047-718-179-503-562; 049-689-823-024-38X; 050-550-631-269-541; 052-446-134-244-370; 052-827-710-698-143; 053-658-202-522-880; 055-445-985-659-763; 056-527-751-571-027; 057-747-780-542-875; 059-105-564-549-667; 063-168-701-877-310; 064-809-365-143-134; 066-305-799-165-14X; 067-093-453-757-564; 068-559-737-175-185; 070-490-041-142-720; 070-653-216-122-865; 072-093-776-093-089; 074-811-095-363-510; 075-243-344-702-688; 076-676-607-062-345; 077-844-962-590-851; 078-256-942-929-374; 081-658-870-930-21X; 085-673-445-902-411; 087-484-669-318-468; 101-530-551-173-910; 104-576-733-478-347; 105-187-655-566-735; 105-235-386-172-925; 106-278-595-322-746; 114-191-953-023-93X; 122-359-674-857-225; 129-661-413-901-55X; 137-747-044-204-704; 150-499-270-238-399; 155-164-039-414-668; 157-760-438-657-783; 159-031-304-167-706; 170-229-607-033-133,2

Analysis of significant policy documents reveals three interrelated discourses that are engaged within England's digital health policies: equity as a neoliberal imaginary of digital efficiency and empowerment; digital health as a pathway towards democratising health care through data-sharing, co-creation and collaboration; and finally, digital health as a route towards extending citizen autonomy through their access to data systems. It advances knowledge of the relationship between digital health policy and health inequalities.

Evans; Dale W. Esliger; Lauren B. Sherar; Sally J Singh,"Introduction Adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF) commonly suffer from exertional dyspnoea and fatigue. Exercise training is recommended in the management of both diseases, yet many of the outcome measures traditionally reported are disease specific and may not fully acknowledge the multimorbid older adult. Based on our previous research, a breathlessness rehabilitation programme for patients with COPD/CHF or combined disease has been introduced as a service improvement within University Hospital Leicester National Health Service Trust and has amalgamated aspects of cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation. This has created an opportunity to expand the outcome measures assessed and introduce a holistic approach in a population that share common symptoms. Therefore, this multisite trial will explore the feasibility of collecting novel outcome markers as part of a comprehensive assessment prior to enrolment in a breathlessness rehabilitation programme for participants with COPD and/or CHF. Methods and analysis The rehabilitation programme consists of 12 sessions, twice weekly, over a 6-week period. In addition to usual rehabilitation outcome measures, the trial will collect measures of future cardiometabolic risk including arterial stiffness, body composition, physical activity/sedentary time, frailty and symptom burden in a comprehensive rehabilitation assessment. The primary outcome measures will centre around feasibility (eg, acceptability of the comprehensive rehabilitation assessment, intervention delivery and the experiences and attitudes of healthcare professionals and participants). Focus groups and interviews will be conducted to further explore barriers and facilitators to the operation and participation in a breathlessness rehabilitation programme and the trial. Thematic analysis will be used for the interpretation of all qualitative data.

Bathymetry data is critical for safety of navigation and is used for many other applications. In an era of ongoing environmental degradation worldwide, bathymetry data (and the knowledge derived from it) play a pivotal role in using and managing the world’s oceans in a way that is in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 - conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.; However, the vast majority of our oceans is still virtually unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored. Only a small fraction of the seafloor has been systematically mapped by direct measurement. The remaining bathymetry is predicted from satellite altimeter data, providing only an approximate estimation of the shape of the seafloor. Several global and regional initiatives are underway to change this situation. This paper presents a selection of these initiatives as best practice examples for bathymetry data collection, compilation and open data sharing as well as the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO (The General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans) Seabed 2030 Project that complements and leverages these initiatives and promotes international collaboration and partnership. Several non-traditional data collection opportunities are looked at that are currently gaining momentum as well as new and innovative technologies that can increase the efficiency of collecting bathymetric data. Finally, recommendations are given towards a possible way forward into the future of seafloor mapping and towards achieving the goal of a truly global ocean bathymetry.",6,,,,General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans; Environmental resource management; Marine conservation; Geology; Data collection; Bathymetric chart; Bathymetry; Environmental degradation; Sustainable development; Sustainability,,,,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme; Natural Environment Research Council,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00283/full http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1338726 https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmars.2019.00283/full https://oceanrep.geomar.de/46776/ https://core.ac.uk/download/200220824.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00283,,10.3389/fmars.2019.00283,2945220899,,0,001-792-776-445-037; 013-420-897-159-772; 014-810-772-364-182; 014-925-229-724-510; 017-404-220-078-917; 018-550-478-217-146; 020-261-282-521-243; 023-919-847-983-099; 024-183-184-267-354; 029-185-042-570-471; 032-640-447-232-77X; 034-955-367-050-414; 036-055-707-631-194; 042-462-567-762-787; 044-626-503-120-719; 044-733-117-497-917; 047-732-596-572-64X; 050-914-443-668-611; 052-860-088-367-567; 055-758-662-173-352; 058-456-350-706-346; 059-495-803-032-494; 067-926-442-206-816; 071-318-924-638-772; 081-361-496-322-849; 097-489-930-508-018; 103-949-569-997-083; 108-875-141-661-928; 109-138-674-192-315; 110-651-560-625-138; 111-195-560-392-979; 112-021-378-167-050; 127-316-569-968-822; 132-375-954-156-266; 140-247-559-680-846; 145-744-183-870-017; 166-211-556-899-462; 180-184-435-769-529,62

Thombs,"Introduction Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted using cohorts and routinely collected health data, including registries, electronic health records and administrative databases, are increasingly used in healthcare intervention research. The development of an extension of the CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement for RCTs using cohorts and routinely collected health data is being undertaken with the goal of improving reporting quality by setting standards early in the process of uptake of these designs. To develop this extension to the CONSORT statement, a scoping review will be conducted to identify potential modifications or clarifications of existing reporting guideline items, as well as additional items needed for reporting RCTs using cohorts and routinely collected health data. Methods and analysis In separate searches, we will seek publications on methods or reporting or that describe protocols or results from RCTs using cohorts, registries, electronic health records and administrative databases. Data sources will include Medline and the Cochrane Methodology Register. For each of the four main types of RCTs using cohorts and routinely collected health data, separately, two investigators will independently review included publications to extract potential checklist items. A potential item will either modify an existing CONSORT 2010, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology or REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data item or will be proposed as a new item. Additionally, we will identify examples of good reporting in RCTs using cohorts and routinely collected health data. Ethics and dissemination The proposed scoping review will help guide the development of the CONSORT extension statement for RCTs conducted using cohorts and routinely collected health data.",8,8,e025266,,Health care; Randomized controlled trial; Observational study; Checklist; MEDLINE; Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology; Protocol (science); Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; Family medicine; Medicine,cohort; consort; randomized controlled trials; rcts; reporting guideline; routinely collected health data,"Administrative Claims, Healthcare; Cohort Studies; Electronic Health Records; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/standards; Registries; Research Design/standards; Review Literature as Topic",,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/N008405/1) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (205039/Z/16/Z) United Kingdom; CIHR (PJT-156172) Canada,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1257629 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/8/e025266 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC6078273 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30082372 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F372730 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/4648814/ http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/8/8/e025266 https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/136448/ https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/11017 https://aura-test.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/11017 https://portal.research.lu.se/sv/publications/protocol-for-a-scoping-review-to-support-development-of-a-consort https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/protocol-for-a-scoping-review-to-support-development-of-a-consort-extension-for-randomised-controlled-trials-using-cohorts-and-routinely-collected-health-data(db9ec126-796c-489d-b186-f9241b2f953e).html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30082372/ https://lup.lub.lu.se/search/publication/10d52f01-3529-49ce-9a77-2bf9bf1536a8 https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/protocol-for-a-scoping-review-to-support-development-of-a-consort https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/372730 https://www.ndph.ox.ac.uk/publications/896844 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/8/8/e025266.full.pdf https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/11017/1/Protocol_for_a_scoping_review_to_support_development_of_a_CONSORT_extension_for_randomised_controlled_trials_using_cohorts_and_routinely_collected_health_data_.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025266,30082372,10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025266,2885245352,PMC6078273,0,000-970-252-625-70X; 002-880-921-520-168; 010-222-991-684-139; 014-722-929-662-576; 020-256-371-343-649; 024-171-534-031-74X; 026-297-351-248-176; 027-778-489-979-557; 028-376-230-712-903; 032-866-615-167-543; 033-707-364-975-666; 037-555-154-136-130; 041-917-217-360-325; 049-177-887-730-348; 051-963-510-272-359; 053-558-122-619-596; 053-984-901-818-510; 061-990-695-799-494; 063-729-104-690-82X; 072-123-043-529-206; 076-434-267-081-109; 079-572-060-852-417; 084-287-827-745-94X; 085-122-226-183-284; 089-167-867-747-515; 106-496-139-213-533; 108-844-825-175-718; 111-853-698-660-501; 127-245-670-262-773; 134-301-272-563-455; 171-288-147-881-196; 189-145-278-705-681,8

Promotional materials and users' own videos typically show homes that have many well-resourced rooms, with good power and data infrastructures. Over the last several years, we have been working with slum communities in India, whose dwellings are usually very compact (one or two rooms), personal home WiFi is almost unheard of, power infrastructures are far less robust, and financial resources put such smart speakers out of individual household reach. Inspired by the ""hole in the wall"" internet-kiosk programme, we carried out workshops with slum inhabitants to uncover issues and opportunities for providing a smart-speaker-type device in public areas and passageways. We designed and deployed a simple probe that allowed passers-by to ask and receive answers to questions.

In this manuscript, we summarize the developments in PRIDE resources and related tools since the previous update manuscript was published in Nucleic Acids Research in 2016. In the last 3 years, public data sharing through PRIDE (as part of PX) has definitely become the norm in the field. In parallel, data re-use of public proteomics data has increased enormously, with multiple applications. We first describe the new architecture of PRIDE Archive, the archival component of PRIDE. PRIDE Archive and the related data submission framework have been further developed to support the increase in submitted data volumes and additional data types.

Furtado; Sumrana Yasmin; Covadonga Bascaran; Cynthia Ogundo; Catherine Jan; Iris Gordon; Nathan Congdon; Matthew J. Burton,"Introduction In 2015, most governments of the world committed to achieving 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) by the year 2030. Efforts to improve eye health contribute to the advancement of several SDGs, including those not exclusively health-related. This scoping review will summarise the nature and extent of the published literature that demonstrates a link between improved eye health and advancement of the SDGs. Methods and analysis Searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health for published, peer-reviewed manuscripts, with no time period, language or geographic limits. All intervention and observational studies will be included if they report a link between a change in eye health and (1) an outcome related to one of the SDGs or (2) an element on a pathway between eye health and an SDG (eg, productivity). Two investigators will independently screen titles and abstracts, followed by full-text screening of potentially relevant articles. Reference lists of all included articles will be examined to identify further potentially relevant studies. Conflicts between the two independent investigators will be discussed and resolved with a third investigator. For included articles, data regarding publication characteristics, study details and SDG-related outcomes will be extracted. Results will be synthesised by mapping the extracted data to a logic model, which will be refined through an iterative process during data synthesis. Ethics and dissemination As this scoping review will only include published data, ethics approval will not be sought. The findings of the review will be published in an open-access, peer-reviewed journal. A summary of the results will be developed for website posting, stakeholder meetings and inclusion in the ongoing Lancet Global Health Commission on Global Eye Health.",10,3,e035789,,Public health; Stakeholder; Observational study; MEDLINE; Protocol (science); Observational Studies as Topic; Global health; Medical education; Sustainable development; Medicine,international health services; ophthalmology; public health,"Delivery of Health Care; Eye; Global Health; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Peer Review; Research Design; Review Literature as Topic; Sustainable Development; Vision, Ocular",,Wellcome Trust (207472/Z/17/Z) United Kingdom,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/10/3/e035789.full.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32193274/ https://osf.io/gu4z6/#! https://europepmc.org/article/MED/32193274 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/3/e035789 https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/global-eye-health-and-the-sustainable-development-goals-protocol- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7202701 https://core.ac.uk/download/347773861.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035789,32193274,10.1136/bmjopen-2019-035789,3011612315,PMC7202701,0,003-631-453-903-772; 015-869-012-196-852; 065-910-519-559-101; 130-014-288-033-902,4

NZ routinely collects health-care data within the Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI). The study objectives were to 1) investigate late-onset dementia estimates using the IDI between 2012-2015 and compare these with 2) published estimates, and 3) variations between North and South Islands and ethnicity. METHODS A population-based, retrospective cohort design was applied to routinely collected de-identified health/administrative IDI data. Dementia was defined by ICD-10-AM dementia codes or anti-dementia drugs. RESULTS Approximately 2% of those aged ≥60 years had dementia, lower than published estimates. Dementia was higher in North Island; in 80- to 89-year-olds; among the Māori population when age-standardised, and 9% of all dementia cases had >1 dementia sub-type. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first study ascertaining dementia estimates using NZ's whole-of-population IDI data. Estimates were lower than existing NZ estimates, for several reasons. Further work is required, including expanding IDI data sets, to develop future estimates that better reflect NZ's diverse population.",39,3,297,304,Epidemiology; Ethnic group; Demography; Retrospective cohort study; Geography; Dementia; Population; Diverse population,Dementia; New Zealand; epidemiology; prevalence; routinely collected data,Dementia/diagnosis; Humans; New Zealand/epidemiology; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Routinely Collected Health Data,,Medical Research Council (MRC) UK (MR/ L501530/1 MR/K02992/1); Medical Research Council (MRC) UK (MR/K02992/1); Medical Research Council Supplementary Travel Grant; Alzheimer Scotland (R44394); Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (MR/ L501530/1 MR/K02992/1) United Kingdom; Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (MR/K02992/1) United Kingdom,https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/prevalence-and-geographical-variation-of-dementia-in-new-zealand- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ajag.12790 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajag.12790 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32394527 https://core.ac.uk/download/326030276.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajag.12790,32394527,10.1111/ajag.12790,3025963442,,0,005-622-204-162-967; 007-349-486-555-483; 009-872-287-195-162; 010-222-991-684-139; 014-755-938-076-027; 025-062-288-588-465; 026-849-955-401-197; 030-071-284-737-035; 032-205-919-632-645; 034-356-581-774-339; 036-072-806-225-620; 040-332-406-005-971; 048-843-908-332-062; 062-854-326-216-660; 067-055-022-258-563; 067-350-778-765-655; 082-644-788-086-40X; 092-062-433-893-248; 092-571-544-269-638; 109-155-997-134-878; 130-674-344-010-021,0

Chris Victor; Cynthia G. Whitney; Anita K. M. Zaidi; Elizabeth R. Zell,"Case-control studies are commonly used to evaluate effectiveness of licensed vaccines after deployment in public health programs. Such studies can provide policy-relevant data on vaccine performance under 'real world' conditions, contributing to the evidence base to support and sustain introduction of new vaccines. However, case-control studies do not measure the impact of vaccine introduction on disease at a population level, and are subject to bias and confounding, which may lead to inaccurate results that can misinform policy decisions. In 2012, a group of experts met to review recent experience with case-control studies evaluating the effectiveness of several vaccines; here we summarize the recommendations of that group regarding best practices for planning, design and enrollment of cases and controls. Rigorous planning and preparation should focus on understanding the study context including healthcare-seeking and vaccination practices. Case-control vaccine effectiveness studies are best carried out soon after vaccine introduction because high coverage creates strong potential for confounding. Endpoints specific to the vaccine target are preferable to non-specific clinical syndromes since the proportion of non-specific outcomes preventable through vaccination may vary over time and place, leading to potentially confusing results. Controls should be representative of the source population from which cases arise, and are generally recruited from the community or health facilities where cases are enrolled. Matching of controls to cases for potential confounding factors is commonly used, although should be reserved for a limited number of key variables believed to be linked to both vaccination and disease. Case-control vaccine effectiveness studies can provide information useful to guide policy decisions and vaccine development, however rigorous preparation and design is essential.",35,25,3295,3302,Peer review; Public health; Matching (statistics); Best practice; Vaccination; Disease; Context (language use); Family medicine; Medicine; Confounding,Case-control studies; Evaluation studies; Vaccines,"Case-Control Studies; Control Groups; Female; Humans; Immunization Programs; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Male; Treatment Outcome; Vaccination; Vaccines",Vaccines,World Health Organization (001) International; Wellcome Trust (203077) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/K012126/1) United Kingdom; NCIRD CDC HHS (U01 IP001048) United States,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28442231/ https://ecommons.aku.edu/pakistan_fhs_mc_women_childhealth_paediatr/300/ https://www.tropicalmedicine.ox.ac.uk/publications/693497 https://ecommons.aku.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1301&context=pakistan_fhs_mc_women_childhealth_paediatr https://core.ac.uk/display/82914699 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17305157 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/case-control-vaccine-effectiveness-studies-preparation-design-and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7007298/ https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/2488065 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28442231 https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/3860797/ https://core.ac.uk/download/82914699.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.04.037,28442231,10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.04.037,2605758023,PMC7007298,0,001-807-100-988-399; 002-208-313-366-771; 002-340-442-772-897; 003-939-887-333-624; 005-314-951-437-122; 005-566-016-861-003; 006-101-437-086-101; 008-985-754-022-450; 009-322-717-816-859; 010-810-824-969-592; 010-885-727-303-20X; 011-603-812-591-777; 012-308-865-956-439; 013-099-299-312-855; 014-502-236-498-406; 014-909-812-174-886; 015-859-621-300-257; 016-324-139-528-769; 017-636-965-840-542; 020-357-731-307-135; 020-984-864-738-310; 021-774-890-682-331; 021-864-402-216-999; 022-965-004-802-289; 022-988-974-788-31X; 022-996-534-720-637; 024-406-788-976-827; 025-997-051-198-331; 026-715-834-272-110; 027-855-524-163-841; 029-503-222-706-293; 029-737-167-569-004; 030-631-482-924-088; 032-543-695-684-957; 033-253-413-976-128; 036-852-787-258-204; 037-074-956-389-52X; 038-021-649-909-983; 043-336-790-195-585; 046-829-172-957-137; 050-012-398-731-569; 052-570-562-798-482; 053-370-463-579-815; 053-420-641-368-600; 055-571-753-737-758; 058-107-150-613-844; 058-992-872-482-959; 060-443-384-866-494; 061-641-720-918-366; 064-931-342-066-091; 067-284-264-616-502; 068-390-847-223-343; 068-939-301-087-242; 070-183-757-651-395; 075-023-344-816-568; 075-146-123-148-99X; 081-211-554-394-506; 083-854-156-768-420; 083-871-524-852-488; 087-291-783-570-973; 087-767-431-288-828; 092-177-288-147-483; 093-163-557-191-618; 094-860-321-297-723; 096-933-213-037-93X; 098-212-183-766-201; 099-397-955-675-271; 100-456-000-483-745; 106-276-766-342-778; 111-350-521-486-232; 113-288-953-791-327; 115-115-748-082-086; 115-981-102-784-426; 117-314-321-968-915; 120-470-217-836-675; 122-221-665-463-417; 127-980-837-048-615; 128-318-631-584-877; 144-805-721-893-217; 157-132-803-566-007; 160-067-976-510-132; 170-141-611-647-30X; 174-057-677-620-090; 174-363-430-148-914; 180-107-759-391-199; 193-263-813-914-197,38

In this article, we review three HUPO-PSI data standards - mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, which can be used to design a complete quantitative analysis pipeline in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the content of each data model, sufficient for bioinformaticians to devise proteomics software. We also provide guidance on the use of recently released application programming interfaces (APIs) developed in Java for each of these standards, which makes it straightforward to read and write files of any size. We have produced a set of example Java classes and a basic graphical user interface to demonstrate how to use the most important parts of the PSI standards, available from http://code.google.com/p/psi-standard-formats-tutorial.

Nollen; Rex Kerr; André Ex Brown,"Animal behavior is increasingly being recorded in systematic imaging studies that generate large data sets. To maximize the usefulness of these data there is a need for improved resources for analyzing and sharing behavior data that will encourage re-analysis and method development by computational scientists. However, unlike genomic or protein structural data, there are no widely used standards for behavior data. It is therefore desirable to make the data available in a relatively raw form so that different investigators can use their own representations and derive their own features. For computational ethology to approach the level of maturity of other areas of bioinformatics, we need to address at least three challenges: storing and accessing video files, defining flexible data formats to facilitate data sharing, and making software to read, write, browse, and analyze the data.

Adolescents in England are among the heaviest drinkers in Europe. Recently, the proportion of adolescents who drink alcohol has fallen, although consumption among those who do drink has actually increased. This trial seeks to investigate how effective and efficient an alcohol brief intervention is with 11–15 years olds to encourage lower alcohol consumption. Methods and analysis This is an individually randomised two-armed trial incorporating a control arm of usual school-based practice and a leaflet on a healthy lifestyle (excl. alcohol), and an intervention arm that combines usual practice with a 30 min brief intervention delivered by school learning mentors and a leaflet on alcohol. At least 30 schools will be recruited from four regions in England (North East, North West, London, Kent and Medway) to follow-up 235 per arm. The primary outcome is total alcohol consumed in the last 28 days, using the 28 day Timeline Follow Back questionnaire measured at the 12-month follow-up. The analysis of the intervention will consider effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. A qualitative study will explore, via 1:1 in-depth interviews with (n=80) parents, young people and school staff, intervention experience, intervention fidelity and acceptability issues, using thematic narrative synthesis to report qualitative data.

Hill; Paul W. Prickett; Roger I. Grosvenor; Gareth Hankins,"Manufacturing equipment embraces an increasing measure of tacit intelligence, in both capacity and value. However, this intelligence is yet to be exploited effectively. This is due to both the costs and limitations of developed approaches and a deficient understanding of data value and data origin. This work investigates the principal limitations of typical machine tool data and encourages consideration of such inherent limitations in order to improve potential monitoring strategies. This work presents a novel approach to the acquisition and processing of machine tool cutting data. The approach considers the condition of the monitored system and the deterioration of cutting tool performance. The management of the cutting process by the machine tool controller forms the basis of the approach, and hence, makes use of the tacit intelligence that is deployed in such a task. By using available machine tool controller signals, the impact on day-to-day machining operations is minimised while avoiding the need to retrofit equipment or sensors. The potential of the approach in the contexts of the emerging internet of things and intelligent process management and monitoring is considered. The efficacy of the approach is evaluated by correlating the actively derived measure of process variation with an offline measurement of product form. The potential is then underlined through a series of experiments for which the derived variation is assessed as a direct measure of the cutting tool health. The proposed system is identified as both a viable alternative and synergistic addition to current approaches that mainly consider the form and features of the manufactured componen",104,5-8,1693,1707,,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Renishaw,https://core.ac.uk/download/211278655.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00170-019-03963-0,,10.1007/s00170-019-03963-0,,,0,000-984-342-240-691; 001-351-416-531-253; 014-709-557-704-512; 020-513-848-001-609; 025-060-434-437-771; 028-979-143-722-372; 037-588-448-531-305; 039-563-052-934-329; 056-123-295-178-043; 057-605-946-504-120; 058-306-539-088-453; 061-961-581-988-913; 064-385-129-383-180; 068-133-225-166-201; 070-999-727-519-248; 075-606-340-694-051; 077-074-385-974-506; 077-416-063-058-764; 080-370-808-298-824; 082-894-245-957-67X; 087-664-827-101-415; 091-309-890-249-613; 109-152-404-545-265; 112-182-937-809-433; 112-639-870-069-414; 136-048-153-458-851; 142-971-180-291-918; 149-080-269-964-424; 154-926-290-841-610; 198-005-434-324-170,0

Godolphin; E. J. Godolphin,"In scientific experiments where human behaviour or animal response is intrinsically involved, such as clinical trials, there is a strong possibility of recording missing values. Missing data in a clinical trial has the potential to impact severely on study quality and precision of estimates. In studies which use a cross-over design, even a small number of missing values can lead to the eventual design being disconnected. In this case, some or all of the treatment contrasts under test cannot be estimated and the experiment is compromised since little can be achieved from it. Experiments comparing two treatments that use a cross-over design with more than two experimental periods are considered. Methods to limit the impact of missing data on study results are explored. It is shown that the breakdown number and, if it exists, perpetual connectivity of the planned design are useful robustness properties which guard against the possibility of a disconnected eventual design. A procedure is proposed which assesses planned designs for robustness against missing values and the method is illustrated by assessing several designs that have been previously considered on cross-over studies.",132,,31,45,Small number; Reliability engineering; Scientific experiment; Cross over; Study quality; Computer science; Missing data; Robustness (computer science),,,,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)’s Doctoral Research Fellowship,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10083381/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016794731830166X http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/csda/csda132.html#GodolphinG19 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/6101521 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/csda/csda132.html#GodolphinG19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2018.06.020,,10.1016/j.csda.2018.06.020,2821446819,,0,000-938-350-171-561; 001-657-486-828-599; 002-328-828-259-066; 005-986-473-198-519; 007-160-913-162-125; 007-362-300-866-571; 007-557-670-064-234; 010-281-733-492-572; 011-186-349-299-71X; 011-985-644-982-90X; 012-983-673-054-966; 024-779-172-475-698; 026-875-404-005-648; 030-976-153-647-343; 037-685-352-952-644; 047-263-573-707-055; 052-895-874-067-000; 053-421-429-890-279; 059-320-259-441-66X; 071-331-096-069-151; 074-877-805-952-750; 083-060-167-742-539; 083-967-282-100-748; 084-793-681-421-740; 085-285-250-556-155; 087-710-579-804-270; 089-388-162-988-510; 098-447-659-448-548; 108-223-563-968-299; 114-470-064-917-695; 128-657-747-259-597; 186-705-481-673-631,1

Lucassen; Alison Hall; Anna Middleton; Nazneen Rahman; Sian Ellard; Helen V. Firth,"<ns4:p>Sharing de-identified genetic variant data is essential for the practice of genomic medicine and is demonstrably beneficial to patients. Robust genetic diagnoses that inform medical management cannot be made accurately without reference to genetic test results from other patients, as well as population controls. Errors in this process can result in delayed, missed or erroneous diagnoses, leading to inappropriate or missed medical interventions for the patient and their family. The benefits of sharing individual genetic variants, and the harms of <ns4:italic>not</ns4:italic> sharing them, are numerous and well-established. Databases and mechanisms already exist to facilitate deposition and sharing of pseudonomised genetic variants, but clarity and transparency around best practice is needed to encourage widespread use, prevent inconsistencies between different communities, maximise individual privacy and ensure public trust. We therefore recommend that widespread sharing of a small number of individual genetic variants associated with limited clinical information should become standard practice in genomic medicine. Information robustly linking genetic variants with specific conditions is fundamental biological knowledge, not personal information, and therefore should not require consent to share. For additional case-level detail about individual patients or more extensive genomic information, which is often essential for clinical interpretation, it may be more appropriate to use a controlled-access model for data sharing, with the ultimate aim of making as much information as open and de-identified as possible with appropriate consent.</ns4:p>",4,,22,,,,,,Wellcome Trust,,http://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15090.1,,10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15090.1,,,0,000-129-004-228-019; 001-610-630-749-994; 002-203-796-204-386; 005-550-008-145-57X; 010-232-055-736-062; 011-164-146-144-323; 014-425-309-442-141; 015-307-411-123-672; 016-555-073-400-460; 018-322-645-602-654; 023-178-829-367-107; 023-474-058-772-740; 023-824-188-041-88X; 024-768-036-874-551; 025-277-168-494-067; 026-629-559-633-469; 027-268-201-967-89X; 028-176-809-501-48X; 029-268-206-974-530; 029-973-257-212-935; 036-855-305-545-432; 037-264-438-159-051; 037-295-889-904-489; 038-153-305-566-811; 040-059-033-991-70X; 043-105-960-054-593; 046-718-041-032-044; 047-985-504-801-739; 053-370-563-090-523; 053-897-550-990-347; 055-875-724-942-43X; 063-402-525-465-255; 065-857-059-194-278; 069-869-800-849-462; 072-318-773-202-408; 074-723-345-340-283; 075-204-677-494-600; 075-764-553-101-161; 079-549-760-007-032; 085-791-006-672-535; 085-919-700-879-544; 087-670-515-684-675; 087-717-454-000-772; 091-110-421-619-820; 093-168-234-627-459; 093-907-724-436-643; 097-762-824-254-741; 100-858-694-520-337; 107-158-439-318-278; 109-294-779-885-278; 113-595-164-011-180; 123-918-123-442-343; 126-368-122-664-759; 127-016-670-476-238; 146-264-292-146-929; 153-579-164-869-620,5

Sydes; Kerry Woolfall; Mike Clarke; Gordon D Murray; Paula R Williamson,"Individual participant data (IPD) from completed clinical trials should be responsibly shared to support efficient clinical research, generate new knowledge and bring benefit to patients. The Medical Research Council (MRC) Hubs for Trials Methodology Research (HTMR) has developed guidance to facilitate the sharing of IPD from publicly funded clinical trials. Development of the guidance was completed over four phases which included a focussed review of policy documents, a web-based survey of the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (CRC) Registered Clinical Trials Units (CTU) Network, participation of an expert committee and an open consultation with the UKCRC Registered CTU Network. The project was funded by the MRC HTMR (MR/L004933/1-R39). Good practice principles include: (i) the use of a controlled access approach, using a transparent and robust system to review requests and provide secure data access; (ii) seeking consent for sharing IPD from trial participants in all future clinical trials with adequate assurance that patient privacy and confidentiality can be maintained; and (iii) establishing an approach to resource the sharing of IPD which would include support from trial funders, sponsor organisations and users of IPD. The guidance has been endorsed by Cancer Research UK, MRC Methodology Research Programme Advisory Group, Wellcome Trust and the Executive Group of the UKCRC Registered CTU Network. The National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) has confirmed it is supportive of the application of this guidance. Implementation of these principles will improve transparency, increase the coherent sharing of IPD from publicly funded trials, and help publicly funded trials to adhere to trial funder and journal requirements for data sharing.",13,1,298,298,Medical research; MEDLINE; Information Dissemination; Data sharing; Transparency (behavior); Medical education; Clinical trial; Resource (project management); Confidentiality; Medicine,,Clinical Trials as Topic/economics; Financial Support; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Information Dissemination; Policy Making,,Medical Research Council (MR/K025635/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0800792) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT095874MF) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L004933/1-R39) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MR/L004933/1) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12023/24) United Kingdom,https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/150204433/IPD.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26675031 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26675031/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682216 https://core.ac.uk/display/43717472 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/23784692/How_should_individual_participant_data_IPD_from_publicly_funded_clinical_trials_be_shared.pdf https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1474625/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186%2Fs12916-015-0532-z https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/how-should-individual-participant-data-ipd-from-publicly-funded-c https://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/13/298 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/26675031 https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-015-0532-z https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs12916-015-0532-z.pdf https://paperity.org/p/74883183/how-should-individual-participant-data-ipd-from-publicly-funded-clinical-trials-be-shared https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-015-0532-z/fulltext.html https://core.ac.uk/download/160109565.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12916-015-0532-z,26675031,10.1186/s12916-015-0532-z,2210211430,PMC4682216,0,004-927-101-042-867; 011-097-447-532-517; 015-781-575-530-328; 015-872-412-152-258; 018-941-317-177-639; 021-495-622-209-802; 027-041-817-375-714; 041-304-863-075-498; 045-221-908-045-316; 048-382-477-690-730; 049-177-887-730-348; 063-156-205-440-998; 069-288-977-041-922; 072-961-415-314-920; 078-021-031-098-075; 079-556-716-744-858; 085-361-807-340-952; 096-686-877-615-274; 115-884-553-803-003; 118-055-657-395-789; 133-309-254-271-395; 145-612-133-816-907,43

Statisticians are ambassadors for data sharing and are central to its success. They play an integral role in data sharing discussions within their companies and also externally helping to shape policy and processes while providing input into practical solutions to aid data sharing. Data sharing is generating changes in the required profile for statisticians in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, as well as academic institutions and patient advocacy groups.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Successful statisticians need to possess many qualities required in today's pharmaceutical environment such as collaboration, diplomacy, written and oral skills and an ability to be responsive; they are also knowledgeable when debating strategy and analytical techniques. However, increasing data transparency will require statisticians to evolve and learn new skills and behaviours during their career which may not have been an accepted part of the traditional role. Statisticians will move from being the gate-keepers of data to be data facilitators. To adapt successfully to this new environment, the role of the statistician is likely to be broader, including defining new responsibilities that lie beyond the boundaries of the traditional role. Statisticians should understand how data transparency can benefit them and the potential strategic advantage it can bring and be fully aware of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry commitments to data transparency and the policies within their company or research institute in addition to focusing on reviewing requests and provisioning data. Data transparency will evolve the role of statisticians within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, academia and research bodies to a level which may not have been an accepted part of their traditional role or career. In the future, skills will be required to manage challenges arising from data sharing; statisticians will need strong scientific and statistical guiding principles for reanalysis and supplementary analyses based on researchers' requests, have enhanced consultancy skills, in particular the ability to defend good statistical practice in the face of criticism and the ability to critique methods of analysis. Statisticians will also require expertise in data privacy regulations, data redaction and anonymisation and be able to assess the probability of re-identification, an ability to understand analyses conducted by researchers and recognise why such analyses may propose different results compared to the original analyses. Bringing these skills to the implementation of data sharing and interpretation of the results will help to maximise the value of shared data while guarding against misleading conclusions.</AbstractText>",16 Suppl 1,,75,,,Academic research; Biotechnology research; Clinical trial; Data sharing; Pharmaceutical research; Statistician; Transparency,Humans; Information Dissemination; Professional Role; Statistics as Topic,,Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12023/24) United Kingdom,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27410483,27410483,,,PMC4943485,0,074-259-630-618-145,7

Clarke; Jill M. van der Meulen; Claudia Mazzà,"BACKGROUND: Wearable sensors offer the potential to bring new knowledge to inform interventions in patients affected by multiple sclerosis (MS) by thoroughly quantifying gait characteristics and gait deficits from prolonged daily living measurements. The aim of this study was to characterise gait in both laboratory and daily life conditions for a group of patients with moderate to severe ambulatory impairment due to MS. To this purpose, algorithms to detect and characterise gait from wearable inertial sensors data were also validated. METHODS: Fourteen patients with MS were divided into two groups according to their disability level (EDSS 6.5-6.0 and EDSS 5.5-5.0, respectively). They performed both intermittent and continuous walking bouts (WBs) in a gait laboratory wearing waist and shank mounted inertial sensors. An algorithm (W-CWT) to estimate gait events and temporal parameters (mean and variability values) using data recorded from the waist mounted sensor (Dynaport, Mc Roberts) was tested against a reference algorithm (S-REF) based on the shank-worn sensors (OPAL, APDM). Subsequently, the accuracy of another algorithm (W-PAM) to detect and classify WBs was also tested. The validated algorithms were then used to quantify gait characteristics during short (sWB, 5-50 steps), intermediate (iWB, 51-100 steps) and long (lWB, >100 steps) daily living WBs and laboratory walking. Group means were compared using a two-way ANOVA. RESULTS: W-CWT compared to S-REF showed good gait event accuracy (0.05-0.10 s absolute error) and was not influenced by disability level. It slightly overestimated stride time in intermittent walking (0.012 s) and overestimated highly variability of temporal parameters in both intermittent (17.5%-58.2%) and continuous walking (11.2%-76.7%). The accuracy of W-PAM was speed-dependent and decreased with increasing disability. The ANOVA analysis showed that patients walked at a slower pace in daily living than in the laboratory. In daily living gait, all mean temporal parameters decreased as the WB duration increased. In the sWB, the patients with a lower disability score showed, on average, lower values of the temporal parameters. Variability decreased as the WB duration increased. CONCLUSIONS: This study validated a method to quantify walking in real life in people with MS and showed how gait characteristics estimated from short walking bouts during daily living may be the most informative to quantify level of disability and effects of interventions in patients moderately affected by MS. The study provides a robust approach for the quantification of recognised clinically relevant outcomes and an innovative perspective in the study of real life walking.",13,5,e0196463,,Gait analysis; STRIDE; Waist; Multiple sclerosis; In patient; Gait (human); Ambulatory; Medicine; Analysis of variance; Physical medicine and rehabilitation,,Activities of Daily Living; Female; Gait; Humans; Laboratories; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis/physiopathology,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/130547/ https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196463 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PLoSO..1396463S/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/156994454 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29715279 https://plos.figshare.com/collections/Free-living_and_laboratory_gait_characteristics_in_patients_with_multiple_sclerosis/4086425 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196463&type=printable https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196463 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5929566 https://core.ac.uk/download/157728834.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0196463,29715279,10.1371/journal.pone.0196463,2801415007,PMC5929566,0,000-446-259-640-143; 001-208-074-156-147; 002-685-332-578-034; 004-360-529-039-066; 005-010-696-449-210; 005-013-416-749-520; 006-350-901-782-889; 006-615-644-763-134; 009-322-626-572-721; 010-264-636-300-861; 010-303-372-731-092; 010-780-893-350-115; 014-369-983-668-886; 016-058-803-065-020; 020-262-744-004-932; 022-967-973-651-546; 027-219-768-550-533; 029-889-938-435-147; 030-759-221-830-908; 032-420-507-314-263; 033-585-352-822-408; 035-181-446-169-624; 035-319-665-245-438; 036-976-165-941-10X; 038-276-928-634-788; 038-601-358-287-556; 042-171-360-893-405; 045-723-947-179-018; 045-915-144-058-083; 046-424-330-714-187; 051-701-958-704-981; 053-424-623-526-298; 062-009-487-706-734; 062-695-262-953-235; 065-765-523-176-287; 066-573-249-912-447; 079-393-204-245-381; 084-635-342-444-821; 087-939-185-675-838; 089-620-703-758-843; 096-023-372-126-224; 098-947-849-734-650; 099-115-290-077-948; 106-870-964-129-611; 113-688-948-246-861; 115-019-262-314-078; 120-035-750-096-568; 120-790-620-640-800; 121-227-520-271-984; 130-166-954-102-504; 134-642-757-658-503,47

This is a major paradigm shift with the aim of maximising the value of patient-level data from clinical trials for the benefit of future patients and society. We consider the analysis of shared clinical trial data in three broad categories: (1) reanalysis - further investigation of the efficacy and safety of the randomized intervention, (2) meta-analysis, and (3) supplemental analysis for a research question that is not directly assessing the randomized intervention.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">In order to support appropriate interpretation and limit the risk of misleading findings, analysis of shared clinical trial data should have a pre-specified analysis plan. However, it is not generally possible to limit bias and control multiplicity to the extent that is possible in the original trial design, conduct and analysis, and this should be acknowledged and taken into account when interpreting results. We highlight a number of areas where specific considerations arise in planning, conducting, interpreting and reporting analyses of shared clinical trial data. A key issue is that that these analyses essentially share many of the limitations of any post hoc analyses beyond the original specified analyses. The use of individual patient data in meta-analysis can provide increased precision and reduce bias. Supplemental analyses are subject to many of the same issues that arise in broader epidemiological analyses. Specific discussion topics are addressed within each of these areas. Increased provision of patient-level data from industry and academic-led clinical trials for secondary research can benefit future patients and society. Responsible data sharing, including transparency of the research objectives, analysis plans and of the results will support appropriate interpretation and help to address the risk of misleading results and avoid unfounded health scares.</AbstractText>",16 Suppl 1,,76,,,,"Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Industry; Humans; Information Dissemination; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Quality Assurance, Health Care",,Medical Research Council (MC_UU_12023/24) United Kingdom,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27410240,27410240,,,PMC4943488,0,000-671-858-840-930; 005-152-368-322-388; 006-782-636-400-809; 015-781-575-530-328; 016-256-159-848-688; 021-925-215-428-423; 022-862-716-303-646; 026-080-491-235-214; 026-205-597-910-501; 029-235-243-660-310; 031-409-796-613-468; 042-086-199-343-960; 047-602-858-621-072; 050-260-636-209-964; 053-952-584-327-681; 060-857-884-978-492; 064-707-666-810-714; 066-472-778-120-696; 067-092-077-780-183; 069-092-765-600-767; 069-788-054-772-189; 070-124-705-340-376; 079-535-907-403-025; 085-361-807-340-952; 086-641-764-838-584; 090-293-517-204-169; 100-548-162-027-396; 117-847-857-173-119; 118-775-367-472-120; 124-895-553-714-473; 127-028-324-574-028,5

Different skills are entrenched into the broader economy in their own ways. Technologies in mature manufacturing industries change slowly and employment growth has smaller knock-on effects than those in new sectors, such as smartphone services. Cloud computing reduces and redeploys in-house information management workers but the total effect, even with a conservative view of productivity gains, is unlikely to reduce total employment of technically skilled people. We see modest growth mostly but significant gains in local areas, as in the boost to London’s labor market brought on by “digital London”. The fact that employment grows as we have described addresses the common, often shrill, warnings about skills shortages.",,,71,93,Information management; Top-down and bottom-up design; Business; Labour economics; Manufacturing; Digital economy; Productivity; Employment growth; Information and Communications Technology; Cloud computing,,,,"International Development Research Centre; Department for International Development, UK Government; LIRNEasia",https://core.ac.uk/display/155777459 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78420-5_5 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78420-5_5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78420-5_5,,10.1007/978-3-319-78420-5_5,2801888763,,0,008-632-062-660-378; 023-597-182-871-295; 059-763-474-889-005; 065-022-223-799-995; 099-209-755-393-850; 100-286-931-324-110; 119-133-787-535-900; 152-827-814-777-941,1
